The previous consignment from Iran, which comprised approximately 450 drones, has been reportedly used by Russia with deadly effect in Ukraine, thereby confirming the lethal nature of these weapons systems (2,3).\n\nTo counteract and address the Iranian provision of weapons to Russia, the United States has declared its intent to deploy every tool at its disposal. This includes the imposition of sanctions and other financial measures aimed at disrupting Iran's UAV proliferation networks. The US State Department has been vigilant in its monitoring efforts, with spokespeople emphasizing the continuous pursuit of targets that may be suitable for such responses (4,5). Moreover, the EU has imposed sanctions over Iran's sale of drones to Russia, highlighting the gravity of these transfers and their implications on the conflict in Ukraine (8). These mechanisms are part of a broader international effort to ensure accountability and prevent the escalation of hostilities through the unchecked flow of arms."

The US State Department has stated its commitment to using \"every relevant and appropriate tool\" to expose and counter Iran's weapons provision to Russia, vigorously enforcing sanctions on the arms trade between both nations (3). However, the complexity of the situation is evident, considering Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps often makes independent decisions on weapons and overseas conflicts, potentially diminishing the impact of diplomatic pressures and sanctions aimed at the Iranian government itself (2).\n\nIn response to Iran's actions, the US is \"looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions,\" indicating a potential expansion of measures to disrupt the flow of Iranian weaponry to Russia (1). Additional sanctions could be imposed on individuals and networks involved in the proliferation of military equipment, as the US has been targeting Iran's UAV networks for months (3). Nevertheless, the potential for further sanctions raises questions about their overall efficacy, considering the misapprehension of sanctions as a rapid deterrent, rather than a tool that can gradually weaken an economy (5).

This support could ironically lead to increased Western attention to the Middle East, contrary to Iran\u2019s intention to divert the US focus from the region. Consequently, it is recommended that Washington should ensure that its regional allies are well-equipped to counter Iran's aggression (1). Furthermore, NATO has condemned Iran's potential coordination with Russia, particularly in supplying drones and the possibility of ballistic missiles, which indicates a serious concern within the alliance regarding Iran's involvement in the conflict (9).\n\nThe increased Iranian support for Russia, especially if it includes the supply of ballistic missiles, could significantly escalate the conflict and alter the strategic situation on the ground (4,5). While the current military aid from Iran is not expected to change the war's momentum according to some analysts (3), the possibility of more advanced weapons transfers has triggered the West to consider bolstering Ukraine's air-defense capabilities urgently (6). This suggests that Iran's deepening involvement on the side of Russia is likely to affect the strategic calculus of NATO and its member states, potentially leading to a recalibration of the support provided to Ukraine to counter the enhanced threats posed by Iranian-supplied weaponry (1,4,6,9)."

The United States has signaled its intent to counter Iran's actions by using various tools to expose and confront Iran's arms trade with Russia, and to enforce sanctions vigorously (3). The potential increase in weapons shipments could further strain Iran's international relations and provoke additional sanctions, especially if Iran sends advanced precision-guided missiles to Russia, which would mark a significant escalation (5). This situation provides impetus for the U.S. and its allies to consider withdrawing any sanctions relief offers and to push for a snapback of U.N. sanctions at the Security Council, as advocated by some policy experts (4).",

The U.S. and the EU have already imposed sanctions on individuals and entities within Iran for previous arms sales to Russia, and such actions are likely to escalate, potentially leading to a downgrading of diplomatic ties as seen with Ukraine's response (1,9). Moreover, the U.S. State Department has expressed a commitment to using all available tools to counter Iran's arms support to Russia, promising vigorous enforcement of existing sanctions, which reflects the gravity with which the U.S. views these transactions (3).\n\nThe provision of Iranian weapons to Russia not only violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231 but is also seen as contributing to potential war crimes due to the use of these drones against civilian targets in Ukraine (9). This exacerbates Iran's international isolation and undermines any remaining credibility it has with Western nations. The shipment also undermines efforts to negotiate over Iran's nuclear program, with some advocates urging the U.S. and its allies to withdraw all sanctions relief offers and reinstate UN sanctions (4). Furthermore, Iran's actions may cement a perception aligned with the hard-line faction in Tehran which views Western powers as declining, while risking deeper international isolation and economic consequences as a result of heightened sanctions (10)."

In light of Iran's alleged plans to send additional missiles and drones to Russia, the US and EU have already imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities in Iran involved in these transactions (4).

Further, the US is not just relying on sanctions but is \"looking at everything that we can do\" to break up these networks, as stated by Secretary of State Tony Blinken, showcasing a comprehensive approach to the issue (2,3). Additionally, the US and EU have imposed sanctions on individuals and entities in Iran involved in the supply of drones to Russia, aiming to make it more difficult for Iran to sell these weapons to Russia (4).\n\nMoreover, to tighten controls on the proliferation of such weapons, the US has indicated that it will vigorously enforce all sanctions on both Russian and Iranian arms trade (1). The international community also recognizes the need to bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity to counter the threat of incoming Iranian-supplied drones used by Russia (6). NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has also acknowledged Iran's role in supplying drones and considering ballistic missile deliveries to Russia, emphasizing the threat this poses (8). In the broader context of international security, there is a commitment to strengthen arms control and non-proliferation efforts, as evidenced by the international support for modernizing the United Nations and strengthening export controls on materials and technology that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction (10)."

While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. A senior US defense official on Monday said they didn't have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it \"has not and will not\" do so. The Washington Post was first to report Iran's plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia. Some background: Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was \"looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions\" in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia. But it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia. US officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered. Read the full story here.",

Already, more than 4.5 million customers are without power in Kyiv and six other regions because of Russian strikes, Zelensky said in his nightly address Sunday. He also said that on Sunday, Russians \"used Iranian attack drones again,\" but he stopped short of providing any further details. \"The whole world will know that the Iranian regime helps Russia prolong this war,\" Zelensky said. \"If it was not for the Iranian supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now,\" he continued. \"And this means closer to a complete solution to the food crisis.\" Some background: Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including missiles andmore attack drones, to Russia, officials from a western country that closely monitors Iran's weapons program told CNN. The shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. Iranian drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February",

Commission on the Status of Women, saying the international community could not allow the commissions work to be \"undermined from within.\"\n\n\"Irans membership is an ugly stain on the commissions credibility. In our view, it cannot stand,\" the ambassador told a U.N. meeting convened by the U.S. and Albania.\n\nThe move comes after Iranian activists abroad and human rights groups have urged the Biden administration to rally other countries to remove Iran from the U.N. commission, arguing Tehran should face international isolation over its response to the protests.\n\nIranian women have been at the forefront of protests across the country since a 22-year-old woman from the countrys Kurdish region, Mahsa Amini, died in police custody in September. Amini was arrested for allegedly failing to comply with Irans strict dress codes that require women to fully cover their hair and their bodies.\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration will join forces with other countries to remove Iran from the commission and \"will look for opportunities to raise this issue in every applicable U.N. forum.\"\n\n\"Change in Iran should only come from within Iran. But that does not absolve the world of the obligation to stand with the Iranian people as they protest for women, for life, and for freedom,\" she said, echoing the slogan that has been the hallmark of more than six weeks of protests.\n\nThe U.S. also supports establishing a special U.N. commission to investigate Irans treatment of peaceful protesters and to hold responsible Iranian officials accountable, Thomas-Greenfield told reporters later.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement that \"Iran has demonstrated through its denial of womens rights and brutal crackdown on its own people that it is unfit to serve on this commission.\"\n\nAt the U.N. meeting, Thomas-Greenfield said \"while Irans systemic oppression of women is not new, thanks to the bravery of the Iranian people, the regimes abuses have been brought to the fore. \"\n\n\"Across Iran, security forces have detained and tortured peaceful protestors. They have killed hundreds of people and badly injured many more in bloody crackdowns. And they have tried to silence dissent by detaining dozens of civil society activists, journalists and lawyers,\" the American diplomat said.\n\nHuman rights groups have made similar allegations and issued detailed accounts of the crackdown. Two rights groups, Norway-based group Iran Human Rights and the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, said last week that more than 250 protesters have been killed since the protests began. The death toll includes more than 20 protesters under the age of 18, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe U.N. Commission on the Status of Women is designed to promote womens rights and shape global standards on gender equality, according to the U.N. Iran, which ranks 143 among 146 on the World Economic Forums global gender gap index, was elected to the commission in May by secret ballot.\n\nIran has rejected international criticism of its response to the protests and denied it has violated the human rights of Iranian citizens or killed unarmed demonstrators.\n\nJust as diplomats met at the U.N., Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted that the \"riots\" in recent weeks were the result of a plot by the countrys enemies.\n\n\"The enemy started a hybrid war. The U.S., Israel, some sly, vicious European powers, & certain groups used whatever they had to do this,\" he tweeted.\n\nIrans ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, condemned the U.N. meeting hosted by the U.S. and Albania, saying it amounted to an attempt to meddle in his countrys political life.\n\n\"The objective of todays meeting is clearly to interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state,\" Iravani said, calling it \"a flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter and international law, upon which the international legal order is founded.\"\n\nIravani said it was \"ironic\" that the U.S. was criticizing Irans human rights record because he said Washington had inflicted suffering on Iranians through \"decadeslong brutal sanctions.\"\n\nThe ambassador also said Iranian authorities had exercised restraint in their response to the protests, but that approach should not be seen as a sign of \"weakness.\"\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has always been and continues to be committed to the promotion and protection of human rights,\" he said.\n\nIrans Constitution respects the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and the government has always upheld those rights, but \"protests should not lead to violence and destruction, chaos, or instability,\" he said.\n\nAt the meeting, which included U.N. Security Council members and other states, envoys from the U.K., Ireland, Norway and other countries joined the U.S. and Albania in condemning Irans treatment of women and its response to recent protests. Before the meeting, Canada and New Zealand called for Irans expulsion from the U.N. commission.\n\nJavaid Rehman, the U.S. special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who was born in Iran, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer who now lives outside of the country, also addressed the U.N. meeting.\n\n\"Its time for us to stop abetting the Islamic Republic of Iran and start supporting the freedom-loving people of Iran,\" said Boniadi.\n\nWomen in leadership positions from 13 countries and other prominent female figures, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Oprah Winfrey; Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai; former first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush; and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad recently signed an open letter calling for governments to immediately remove Iran from the U.N. commission.",

                "cc_text": "Current US policy is setting Washington up for a major crisis with its allies, especially in Europe. This is odd because everyone seems to be getting on. But heres the rub: what happens if China attacks Taiwan and a major war breaks out in Asia? The bill will soon arrive for Europe in particular.\n\nThis is an acute problem because, as is now quite clear, the United States is struggling to keep up with the military advances China is making to prepare for a conflict in the Western Pacific the most plausible locus of such a war. Indeed, many of the most respected voices on US defence matters openly question whether the United States would prevail in a conflict with China centred on Taiwan. And while the Biden Administrations rhetoric has been in many respects good and there are some promising initiatives underway, Washington does not appear to be taking the kind of dramatic steps needed to match Chinas ongoing military buildup, which US defence officials term \"unprecedented\".\n\nAt the same time, as the Biden Administration made clear in its 2022 National Defense Strategy, the United States does not have the capacity to fight both such an exceptionally stressing war with China and another significant conflict, such as in Europe against Russia or the Middle East against Iran, on even roughly concurrent timelines. This military scarcity confronting the United States is felt not so much in overall number of soldiers or total expenditures, but rather in the critical platforms, weapons, and enablers that are the key sources of advantage in modern warfare heavy bombers, attack submarines, sea and airlift, logistics, and precision munitions. It is not clear America has enough systems just to win a war against China alone. Moreover, redressing this gap will be difficult, expensive, and take time. Just witness the challenges the US defence industry is facing in restocking the weapons donated to Ukraine.\n\nIn the meantime, there is a growing chorus of credible warnings that China might seek to move against Taiwan and precipitate a major conflict with the United States, possibly in the coming years. These warnings are not merely coming just from the military and conservative members of Congress (although they are). Rather, senior Biden Administration political appointees, such as Tony Blinken, Jake Sullivan, and Bill Burns, have issued warnings over the previous months that together seem to indicate an assessment that is something like the following: Beijing is resolute about solving the Taiwan issue in its favour; it has moved up its timeline doing so; it regards the most reliable way to do that as through the employment of overwhelming force; and an invasion of Taiwan in the coming years is a distinct threat.\n\nThere is an active debate about just why Beijing might seek to move sooner rather than later. Some point to Beijings potential assessment that the 2020s might be its most propitious opportunity in terms of its relative military advantage over the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. Others point to Xi Jinpings own personal calculus; Xi has explicitly linked the resolution of the Taiwan issue to his central project of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and generally gives the distinct impression of being in deathly earnest about the issue. Finally, some argue that China faces profound looming macroeconomic and demographic challenges, and thus must move before it is hobbled. To be clear, we do not know whether China will move against Taiwan in the coming years; it is quite possible that Xi does not know yet himself. But together these factors have resulted in a very distinct increase in the level of concern that Beijing might do so. And given that China appears to assume that the United States will come to Taiwans defence, such an assault would very likely embroil America whether we like it or not.\n\nHow such a war would unfold cannot be known in advance. It is possible that Chinas forces would prove as underwhelming as Russias, as many in America and Europe suggest. But there are compelling reasons to fear Chinas armed forces would be far more effective in pursuit of their goal. Chinas economy and population are an order of magnitude larger than Russias, while China dwarfs Taiwan in population by almost two orders of magnitude. China, while separated from Taiwan by the Strait, is far closer to Taiwan than the United States or its allies are, and Taiwan lacks land borders with US partners. Moreover, even as the Chinese have reportedly been improving their ability to operate jointly, the simple advantages of quantity and proximity may allow even a poorly performing PLA to overwhelm Taiwan, whose military appears woefully ill-prepared for a defence against China. As a result, it is simply a matter of prudence to anticipate that such a war would be at best a very stressing and consuming challenge for the United States, and that America could very well struggle or even fail.\n\nIn light of this, how would America react to the outbreak of a war with China? Now, if the United States could handily defeat China as it could for many decades, there would be little problem. But this is now very much in doubt. And this is where the issue becomes very pointed for allies, including in Europe.\n\nFirst and foremost, such a conflict would almost certainly suck away high-value US forces everywhere else in the world, including in Europe and the Middle East, and might do so very abruptly. US platforms, munition stocks, and key personnel would be depleted, relocated, or withheld for the priority fight. If the United States were locked in a desperate and uncertain fight over the worlds most important economic area (Asia) against its only peer rival (China), how could it sensibly keep forces locked up elsewhere rather than dedicate them to the main struggle? Iran, North Korea and even Russia pale in comparison to Chinas power so the United States would, rationally speaking, need to ensure it won the \"biggest battle in the decisive theater\", as Churchill put it.\n\nThis would create vulnerabilities in other theatres to Russia in Europe, Iran in the Middle East, and North Korea on the Peninsula. And such vulnerabilities could be lasting, whether because US systems had been depleted or because the United States needed to keep those forces in Asia, either in the context of a protracted war or to hold the line following the end of a conflict with China that had bloodied the American military. As a result of simple necessity, US allies in Europe and the Middle East would have to handle the threats posed by Russia and Iran much more on their own as the United States was consumed with taking on China.\n\nHas Washington frankly and clearly prepared its allies in Europe for this reality? It certainly does not seem like it. In fact, US allies in Nato seem like they are betting on America maintaining its current high level of engagement indefinitely. This is a deeply imprudent approach on both sides.\n\nSecond, the United States especially if it does not adequately prepare its forces and posture in the Pacific for a fight with China is likely to rely heavily on economic warfare against China in such a conflict. If the US military and its allies could handily defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the role of economic sanctions would be secondary since the main focus of American defence strategy in such a conflict would have been achieved. But if the conflict is more evenly matched let alone if China seizes Taiwan and otherwise gains the advantage over US forces in the Western Pacific then the United States will need to generate enough coercive leverage over Beijing to prevail. Since in these circumstances America would not be able to rely on its military to generate enough such leverage, it would have to turn to non-military sources, of which the most salient is economic power.\n\nClearly the United States could not generate anywhere near enough such economic leverage over Beijing to even hope to shift its calculus without also having a lot of other important countries join its economic warfare effort. The natural candidates would include the important economies, and especially Washingtons traditional allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and Europe. Europes market power is a vital ingredient to make this strategy even remotely plausible. Without it, such an economic warfare campaign would obviously be feckless.\n\nThis is not merely speculation. Washingtons behaviour indicates its revealed strategy is likely something like this. The Administration is not significantly increasing defence spending, nor is it sharply shifting US forces focus to the Pacific. In contrast, Washington has actually increased its forces in Europe. At the same time, the Administration has given off the distinct impression that it regards economic tools as a vital part of its strategy to deal with China, as evidenced by its recent move on semiconductors. Indeed, one might be forgiven for observing that the Administration appears to think that economic sanctions, international pressure, and diplomacy are the more sophisticated, \"nuanced\" approach to dealing with China, rather than a passe focus on hard military power.\n\nAt the same time, the Administration talks about allies a lot. This seems nice and reassuring at first glance. But, put in this context, it takes on another complexion. The Administration is saying allies are Americas \"centre of gravity\", its source of strength, the elixir of Washingtons strategy. What does this mean? Well, for this to make sense as a strategy, it must mean that these allies will step up and actually do more in confronting what the Administration itself is saying is the priority challenge: China especially in the context of a desperate battle in the Pacific.\n\nWashingtons actions on Ukraine its leadership of the Nato response, its disproportionate degree of funding, its increase of forces on the continent take on a different complexion in this context as well. It begins to look like a down payment. Washington has been there for Europe. Now it will expect Europe to be there for America if the balloon goes up in Asia. And it will be a big ask. Because our forces in Asia are not adequately prepared, our economic sanctions will have to do a lot more and that will require heavy involvement by Europe in them.\n\nNow, are Washingtons key allies ready to join such an effort? In Asia, probably yes, especially Japan and Australia. They are directly and fundamentally affected by how a war in Asia turns out.\n\nBut in Europe? I think scepticism is in order. Perhaps there is no more fundamental signal than the Chancellor of Europes largest economy explicitly saying last week that Germany would not decouple from China, and then his taking a trip with multiple CEOs of Germanys largest companies to China. And thats not even mentioning the sale of a big portion of Hamburgs port to China. But, to be fair to Germany, most European countries seem to give little if any evidence of a greater willingness to decouple their economies from China, let alone join a massive economic warfare effort against it.\n\nThis has only become more apparent with the war in Ukraine. The bien pensant line is that the Ukraine war shows that aggression must be resisted. But the much more likely outcome is that the intense economic pain that Europe will feel as a result of the war will make it less, not more, likely to join an economic warfare campaign against China, which is such a significant part of European trade and investment. How likely are European capitals whose economies are taking body blows as a result of the war to dramatically intensify that pain over something happening halfway around the world? Not very, it must be said and certainly not to the degree needed to make a difference in Beijings calculations about a war it would indubitably consider absolutely central to its interests.\n\nWhere is all this going to leave us in the transatlantic relationship if war breaks out in Asia? Nowhere good. Americans will feel they have been betrayed by ungrateful and perfidious Europeans. Europeans will feel put upon with ridiculous demands by Washington when they are already bearing the brunt of the pain of decoupling from Russia.\n\nEven worse, such economic warfare is unlikely to work even if countries do join it. The reality is that China has enormous economic capacity and thus could weather much of the effects of such a campaign. Moreover, Xi is focused on strengthening Chinas resilience to precisely such an effort through initiatives such as Dual Circulation. At the same time, Beijing could reduce the efficacy of such an effort by exploiting sympathetic or profiteering third parties, ranging from Russia through the Middle East and even, to be frank, parts of Europe. The reality is that the prices of intercourse with the Chinese economy will be far too attractive for many nations to ignore. Further, as famously nationalist China is likely to be highly motivated over such a conflict, especially over Taiwan, it is likely to be willing to put up with quite a lot of pain. It is worth bearing in mind that economic warfare has essentially never worked as the primary route to victory in major wars in the past.\n\nThis is where things are heading, and it is not good. It will not result in success in Asia, and it will create fierce tensions if not crisis in the transatlantic relationship. There is, though, a better path. It is one that is keyed to where Americans and Europeans respective interests are most directly implicated and what would most effectively deal with the potential for Chinese or Russian aggression, and thus where each side of the Atlantic should realistically best focus. This is more of a \"division of labour\" model, rather than what we are implicitly pursuing today which is more akin to a Three Musketeers approach: all for one and one for all. This sounds inspirational. But it is not realistic.\n\nInstead, America should laser-focus its military on Asia, reducing its level of forces and expenditures in Europe. This will allow America to hopefully deter and, if necessary, defeat a Chinese attack on Taiwan and other US allies in the region, using military force to defeat Chinese aggression rather than substantially relying on economic warfare. Meanwhile, Europe should focus on taking the lead on Ukraine and, more broadly, assuming the primary role in its own conventional defence. In this model, the United States can continue to provide more focused military contributions and support to Nato, but only consistent with a genuine prioritisation of the first island chain necessary to ensure prevailing there against Chinese attack.\n\nIn this approach, economic warfare would play a distinctly secondary role in dealing with an attack on Taiwan. This would impose far less political pressure on the transatlantic relationship. Indeed, in such a model the United States and Europe could continue trading with China. They would only need to decouple to the degree needed to avoid being brought to their knees by Beijing for instance, in areas such as semiconductors, medicine, and PPE. Although they might well decide to decouple more for other valid reasons, it would not be strictly necessary from a strategic point of view.\n\nThis strategy correlates better both with what works and countries real interests in a Taiwan defence. We cannot expect Europe to do things for Asia that it will not do, and we must together adapt accordingly. There is a way to do so, but it requires Europe taking much more leadership and responsibility for its own security. Our current path risks not only defeat in the primary theater but a terrible crisis in the transatlantic relationship. Greater realism will help us avoid both awful outcomes.",

                "cc_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly endorsed the evacuation of civilians from parts of Ukraine's southern Kherson region on Friday, the latest sign of Russia's retreat in one of the most bitterly contested areas in Ukraine.\n\n\"Now, of course, those who live in Kherson should be removed from the zone of the most dangerous actions, because the civilian population should not suffer,\" Putin told pro-Kremlin activists as he marked Russia's Day of National Unity.\n\nMoscow has already been ferrying people out of an area it controls in Kherson on the west bank of the Dnipro River, and this week announced that the evacuation zone would also include a 15 km buffer area on the east bank. But the comments appear to be the first time Putin has endorsed the evacuations personally.\n\nRussia says it has been taking residents to safety from the path of a Ukrainian advance. Kyiv says the measures have included forced deportations of civilians out of Russian-occupied territory, a war crime, which Russia denies.\n\nPutin's comments come as signs are emerging that Russia could be preparing to abandon its military foothold on the west bank of the Dnipro River, including Kherson's regional capital - potentially one of the biggest Russian retreats of the war.\n\nOn Thursday, Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed occupation administration in Kherson, said Russia was likely to pull its troops from the west bank. In later remarks, he was more equivocal, saying he hoped there would be no retreat but \"we have to take some very difficult decisions\".\n\nCurfew\n\nPictures have circulated on the internet showing the main administration building in Kherson city with Russia's flag no longer flying atop it. Kyiv has been wary, saying such signs could be Russian deception to lure Ukrainian troops into a trap.\n\nA 24-hour curfew was imposed on the city on Friday, Stremousov said, adding the measure was necessary to defend Kherson from a likely Ukrainian offensive.\n\nUkrainian soldiers in a mechanized infantry company dug in on a tree line at the front west of Kherson city were confident the Russians would eventually retreat, but would fight as they fall back, auguring a potentially bloody battle for the city.\n\nVitalyi, 48, the company's deputy commander, said recent moves by the Russians to beef up their defenses appeared aimed at protecting a withdrawal rather than holding on to Kherson.\n\n\"They have dug into every field,\" he said, as his men took advantage of the unusually mild weather to improve bunkers and clean their weapons amid thumps of intermittent artillery fire.\n\n\"They have large amounts of tanks and people, but I don't think they have a realistic plan to stay more than one or two weeks,\" he said.\n\nOne of his soldiers, Vladyslav, 27, said he expected the Russians would fight: \"We will fight as well. We have nowhere else to go. This is our home. This is our land.\"\n\nThe regional capital, which is located on the west bank at the mouth of the Dnipro, is the only big city Russia has captured intact since its invasion in February. Its loss for Russian forces would be one of the severest blows of the war.\n\nThe surrounding province controls land access to Russian-occupied Crimea, and securing it was one of the few successes of an otherwise disastrous Russian campaign.\n\nMethodical effort\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he \"certainly\" believed Ukrainian forces could retake the Russian-held area on the west bank, in perhaps his most optimistic comments on the counter-offensive to date.\n\n\"Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe they have the capability to do that. We have seen them engage in a very methodical but effective effort to take back their sovereign territory.\"\n\nThe Pentagon later announced $400 million worth of additional security assistance, including HAWK air defenses against Russian drones and cruise missiles.\n\nA Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some Russian military commanders had already moved across the river to the east, effectively abandoning the troops under their command on the opposite bank.\n\n\"We would assess that in Kherson, it's likely that most echelons of command have withdrawn now across the river to the east, leaving pretty demoralized and often in some cases leaderless troops to face off Ukrainians on the other side,\" the official said.\n\nVladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the occupied province, has said it was evacuating civilians to facilitate \"a layered defense\" in order to repel Ukrainian attacks.",

Washington is, of course, smart to oppose any strengthening of Riyadhs relationship with Moscow. Bidens open-ended statement about possible US action in response to OPEC+ was measured and practical; we really dont know what the best course of action is, because most of the options have serious downsides for the United States.\n\nThose who remember the King Abdullah era of US-Saudi relations lament that Saudi Arabias approach to the United States has become purely transactional, and theyre not wrong. They should rest assured that what looks like a growing strategic relationship between Moscow and Riyadh is transactional for Riyadh as well. The Kingdom is hoping for a few things from Russia that the United States cannot provideand they all relate directly to its most critical challenges.\n\nWhat does Riyadh want from Moscow?\n\nDoing Russia a favor with its oil vote presents interesting possibilities for Riyadh vis--vis Iran, with which the Saudis severed relations in 2016. Consider the case of Russias recent acquisition of Iranian drones, which have been put to use in attacking Kyiv. It looks on the surface like the perfect reason for Saudi Arabia to kick Russia out of court. But it also presents a rare opportunity if the Saudis play their cards right with Moscowjust ask Israelto examine these drones up close or receive data on their battlefield performance. Saudi Arabia also has a keen interest in preventing Iran from using these drones to ingratiate itself with Russia.\n\nSaudi Arabia is hoping that wedging itself between Russia and Iran will bear fruit in Syria as well. Riyadh has accepted that Bashar al-Assad is sticking around, though US and Saudi strategies originally aimed for his departure from the political scene. Riyadhs new goal is to pull Damascus back into the Arab fold and away from Tehran. But no amount of largesse from the Gulf will do the job and no effort to reduce Tehrans influence will succeed unless Arab countries are willing to provide paramilitary forces and arms to Assad to secure his place at the head of government and replace the peace of mind Irans type of aid gives him. Riyadh has not entertained this. In the absence of an international strategy for reducing Iranian influence in Syria, or an achievable vision for the future of Syria from the US administration, Riyadh is pinning its hopes on aligning its interests in the future of Syria with Moscows.\n\nRussias role in blocking potential new United Nations Security Council resolutions that would limit the transfer of arms to the Houthis in Yemen has frustrated Saudi Arabia for years. Gaining leverage to flip Russias position would address what Saudi Arabia sees as an existential threat. Russias dominance in the wheat market is also important to the broader Middle East, a region struggling with food insecurity. This includes Saudi Arabia, where less than 2 percent of the land is arable, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn addition to what Washington cannot provide, Riyadh is looking for a few things that Washington will not provide. Saudi Arabia has flirted with Russias SU-57 and Chinas FC-31, both unproven attempts at approximating the United States F-35 new-generation fighter jet. Neither would interoperate with the rest of Saudis US- and European-made military aircraft. But Saudi Arabias interest in rapid military modernization is in direct conflict with both Congress and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs at the State Department, which are putting the brakes on foreign arms sales.\n\nNot to mention that an unscrupulous operator like Saud al-Qahtanian adviser suspected of directing the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi who remains in MBSs good graceswould likely love Moscow to include (under a benign information-sharing agreement, of course) some of its best practices on global assassination tactics.\n\nPolitical and fiscal handcuffs\n\nSaudi Arabias relationship with the United States should have featured as prominently in its OPEC+ decision as Riyadhs recent liaisons with Moscow. What did that side of the deliberation likely consider?\n\nTo begin with, the United States and Saudi Arabia have weathered eighty years of ups and downs; the relationship wont implode under its current strain. As Landon Derentz, the head of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council, reminded me recently, the United States and Saudi Arabia cooperated like pros to keep energy markets stable as the pandemic began, to the worlds benefit. This is part of an ebb and flow in US-Saudi cooperation on oil that corresponds to other pressures. In Washington these pressures are often political; in Riyadh they are often fiscal.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have weathered eighty years of ups and downs; the relationship wont implode under its current strain.\n\nThis time the fiscal concerns focus on funding the Vision 2030 plan for developing the Kingdom across a host of sectors. MBS has a lot riding on the success of this plan. Stern warnings about a coming global downturn in oil demand have caused the Saudis to question why they are working against their own bottom line to meet their production quotasat the United States requestwhen other producers are not. Saudi Arabias Oil Ministry cautions that over time, producing at the record-high levels the United States requests will zero out spare capacity. It could also mean the ministry cant take facilities temporarily offline for planned maintenance, raising the risk that facilities could fail suddenly, shocking the market.\n\nSeparate but related, Saudi Arabias foreign minister pays particular attention to foreign affairs conversations in Germany after spending many years there. Right now, these conversations include dismay that the United States is refusing to reduce gas prices despite pleas from friends in Europe. The irony is not lost on Riyadh.\n\nOther conversations in Europe about how to structure oil price caps sound ominous to energy producers in the Gulf concerned about such caps becoming common. And expectations of rising public pressure on these European governments once winter heating-oil needs spike cause some in Saudi Arabia to question how serious Europe will be about maintaining sanctions on Russia.\n\nAdd to these domestic concerns that few Saudis are in the mood right now to appease the United States because they feel that Washington cant keep up its end of a deal. The US-Saudi transaction around Bidens visit to Riyadh this summer involved Saudi Arabia and OPEC slightly increasing production while Biden authorized sales of defensive arms to Saudi Arabia. But world events have disrupted that gentlemens agreement. When Putin invaded Ukraine, European nations made independent decisions to donate arms, depleting their own defenses, which now require replenishment. As NATO countries, they skip to the head of the line of nations waiting for delivery of US defense articles. Delivery of items to Saudi Arabia may be pushed back by an additional two years as a result.\n\nWhile this is not a situation where the United States is intentionally slighting Gulf partners, it is a very real problem for the Kingdom, which is regularly attacked with drones and missiles from armed groups backed by Iran. In some Saudis view, if extenuating circumstances require the United States to downgrade its end of the deal a bit, Washington should not mind when extenuating circumstances (such as a projected global downturn in oil demand) cause Riyadh to do the same. Saudi analysts who do not understand the cumbersome process of US weapons transfers watch the speed with which the United States has moved defensive arms to Ukraine and ask why Washington did not do the same after the 2019 Iran-backed attack on Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq or continued attacks thereafter. Watch this space, since Riyadh claims that Tehran is planning an imminent attack on Saudi energy infrastructure again, and this time the White House says the United States wont hesitate to actthough \"act\" is undefined.\n\nPunishing the whippersnapper in Riyadh\n\nWith a burst of energy, Washington has begun looking for options to respond to the perceived slight by OPEC. There is a flurry of conversation about 9/11-based lawsuits, blocks on arms sales, the removal of Patriot air-defense systems from the peninsula, and \"NOPEC\" legislation, which could open the door to trust-busting legal action against OPEC and its member states. Riyadh has pushed back on each of these potential actions on and off for a decadethis is not the first time US policymakers have floated these punitive measuresthrough official, lobbying, and media-messaging channels.\n\nCongress doesnt agree on much, but there is support on both sides of the aisle for teaching the whippersnapper in Riyadh a lessonas evidenced in May when a Senate committee passed NOPEC.\n\nAccording to my conversations with Saudi officials, one of the promises the Biden team makes when meetings occur in Riyadh is that Saudi help with oil prices (or restraint in Yemen, or silence on the Iran nuclear deal, or assistance for Afghan evacuees, or sidelining Assad in Damascus) will be rewarded with friendly treatment in Congress. Riyadh feels like the US administration never delivered on that. Not even a little.\n\nOne of the promises the Biden team makes when meetings occur in Riyadh is that Saudi help with oil prices will be rewarded with friendly treatment in Congress. Riyadh feels like the US administration never delivered on that. Not even a little.\n\nRiyadh is now convinced that this promise of congressional softening was made because the administration did not have much more to offer, given constraints imposed by powerful members of Bidens party vehemently opposed to negotiating with the government that murdered Khashoggi. Without the ability to bring much to the table before the midterm elections, Riyadh wonders, what will the administration be able to offer after, when it is likely at least one chamber of Congress will be controlled by the opposing party?\n\nSo what options does the United States have?\n\nNOPEC resurfaces every time the United States is upset with the Kingdom. The Saudi government dreads it becoming law, but it has prepared for that scenario. Though NOPEC becoming law would certainly create oil-market instability, there is no guarantee that implementing NOPEC would result in the dissolution of OPEC. But for the sake of argument, lets say it did. Breaking up OPEC in the near future would not alter Saudi Arabias ability to drive oil prices up. The Kingdom is, after all, the worlds primary oil swing state. Meanwhile other oil-producing states already cant meet their OPEC quotas and would not be able to increase production any further even if freed from them. If anything, NOPEC could increase Saudi Arabias ability to drive prices up by taking refineries offline, perhaps with the polite excuse that these facilities suddenly require more than the regular amount of maintenance.\n\nSaudi Arabia also took action in September that limits US options for punishing its leadership. The king made MBS prime minister, just days before a State Department opinion was due to a US court on whether federal common law grants the crown prince immunity from criminal charges in the United States. Now that he is prime minister, with the legal protections that confers, there is far less room for the administration to say he has no immunity.\n\nOne of the few levers the United States has at the moment is pending arms sales. Some lawmakers argue that halting these sales could change Riyadhs mind about its relationship with Moscow. These sales are for defensive munitions loaded onto F-16 fighter jets and into Patriot batteries to defend the Kingdom against ongoing drone and missile attacks from groups that Irans president calls nonnegotiable elements of Tehrans foreign policy. Therefore, as an unintended but problematic consequence, reversing the arms sales Biden approved in August would convey the message, \"We condemn Saudi Arabias foreign policy, but we support Irans.\"\n\nBecause the United States has raised the prospect of blocking arms sales to the Kingdom for the duration of the current administration, doing so now does not send a message as strong as its proponents intend. Riyadh likely predicted that Congress would make moves in this direction, has worked through the possible permutations of this scenario several times before, and in some cases has the possibility of alternate suppliers to fall back on.\n\nSaudi Arabia might not be the loudest voice opposing proposals to prevent restocking their Patriots, either. The US militarys Central Command has been working with the Kingdom for some time, at a plodding pace, on bilateral missile defense. From Saudi Arabias perspective, the US militarys own plansincluding a calendar of regular meetings with two-star and four-star generals in the Gulfcontradict actions by members of Congress to prevent restocking of their Patriots, or other more drastic actions such as pulling troops and Patriots out of the Kingdom. (This is not being seriously considered. It would be expensive to do and would be detrimental to the United States own goals in the region. But it is an option.)\n\nAll of this is to help explain how Riyadh views the issues enraging Washington and how Saudi officials interpret their own foreign-policy options and likely US reactions. They follow US politics, the economy, and American public opinion closely, far more closely than Washington follows the Kingdoms. So how did we wind up here, with careful Saudi calculations nevertheless underestimating the ire with which the OPEC+ decision was received? In short, its a generational disconnect. MBS is thirty-seven; 60 percent of Saudis population is under thirty-five. They cannot relate to the emotional weight of a Russian invasion on the American zeitgeist.\n\nThe young leadership populating most of the innermost circle in Riyadh has no memory of the Cold War, but most US leaders were shaped by it. When a country invades a sovereign neighbor, it strikes a nerve in the United States. When that country is Russia, it gives the United States sciatica. Even the first Gulf War cant help young Saudi policy leaders understand why their oil-market alignment with Russia has evoked such vitriol. MBS was five years old when the United States went to war to oppose Iraqs invasion of Kuwaitand the United States has not gone to war for Ukraine.\n\nIts never too late for solutions\n\nCongress is going to tie itself up in details debating what should be done to respond to Saudi Arabias willingness to enable Russias cash flow while Russia is trying to erase Ukraine from the map. A searching review of US-Saudi relations is likely to be one option, though whether Congress can agree this time on just how tough it should beafter failing to do so in 2019 in the wake of the Khashoggi assassinationremains an open question. Reevaluating policy is never a bad idea; a focused review is always valuable. The White House has already pledged a review of the US-Saudi relationship following the OPEC+ decision, but it didnt specify a point person or a timeline. Saudi watchers of all stripes expected Biden to review the US relationship with Saudi Arabia early in his administration (because he said he would).\n\nSuch a review shouldnt be perceived in Riyadh as a threat. A thorough review of the relationship at all levelsnot only on defense, but in fields such as water and food security; education; renewable energy; law enforcement; womens rights; human, civil, and press rights; trafficking and illicit finance; and cultural preservationwill undoubtedly reveal a few low notes but several high notes that many officials in both capitals will find surprising and helpful in updating US policy. If Washingtons moves to punish Riyadhs OPEC+ decision are restrainedand for example do not impact the delivery of defensive arms such as Patriot munitionsMBSs advisers should work discreetly with US counterparts to minimize the oil deals impact on Russias ability to wage war in Ukraine. This could include funding defensive weapons for Ukraine or cooperating on efforts to prevent Iranian materiel from being available for Russian use.\n\nMBSs advisers should work discreetly with US counterparts to minimize the oil deals impact on Russias ability to wage war in Ukraine. This could include funding defensive weapons for Ukraine or cooperating on efforts to prevent Iranian materiel from being available for Russian use.\n\nTo reiterate a suggestion from Derentz at the Atlantic Councils Global Energy Center, Saudi Arabia should also offer ideas for improving global access to affordable oil supply. \"In the context of a major global energy crisis, the Kingdom would benefit from reasserting leadership over international efforts to increase supply, which would help redirect the conversation with the United States and Europe in a way that benefits both customers and producers,\" he said. Saudi Arabia is the only nation with any leverage over Russian oil policy and output at the moment, so it is in a good position to help with thisand Washington should insist that it do so.\n\nThe problem for US policymakers right now is not that Saudi Arabia is choosing Moscow over Washington. The problem is that Saudi Arabia feels like it has the upper hand over both Moscow and Washington. Moscow and Riyadh played King of the Mountain over energy-sector dominance in March of 2020, waging a price war that Saudi Arabia won. And that was before Russia started a war that got it sanctioned. So the Saudis are very confident right now that they can control Russias options on energy policy. But transactional foreign policy being the order of the day, the United States and Europe will need to bring something to the table to make it worth Riyadhs while to do so. Right now, that could be as simple as choosing not to enact punishments (that come with blowback) on Saudi Arabia for being a swing state.\n\nDe-escalate the policy review\n\nUS inaction following the 2019 attack on Abqaiq and blocks on arms sales in years since hint that Washington is over the Carter Doctrine of protecting Gulf countries against external threats. This OPEC+ decision indicates that Riyadh is too.\n\nIn both capitals, there are diametrically opposed opinions about how to reframe the relationship. Resolving those internal differences will be harder than reaching agreement between the two countries on mutual interests.\n\nTherefore, a possible first step could be an informal track 1.5 process with both nations sending policy experts to discuss cooperation and redlines. The agreements signed during Bidens summer trip to the Kingdom represent a solid list of sectors in which cooperation will create value for both countries, so some of the legwork has been done.\n\nThe deliverable would be a draft framework based not on a transaction to secure two individual critical objectives (energy for security), but on a set of shared objectives critical to both capitals. These do actually exist: Both countries have an interest in a smooth energy transition, regional security and stability, the free flow of commerce, and the harnessing of technology to advance development. The dialogues work should be based on a recognition that each country can move much faster and farther in partnership with the other.\n\nThis framework should also include a set of negotiated redlines, the crossing of which would void the agreement and require a re-convening of the track 1.5 process. Decisionmakers in both countries should agree to pursue the frameworks implementation regardless of cabinet shuffles or administration changes.\n\nThere is a second step Washington could take that would provide a win for all sides. A reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship is a great excuse to clean up the US military footprint in the Kingdom. Its past time. To quote one former official at the US Military Training Mission (USMTM) in Riyadh, \"the 80s called and they want their security cooperation back.\" Saudi defense ministry officials made clear to the Pentagon during a visit to Washington this year that there is support in the Kingdom for a reorganization of USMTM. This is because Saudi Arabia pays over fifty million dollars toward USMTM operations. Riyadh could slash this tomorrow, like they did six years ago to the US military organization that manages activities with Saudi Arabias National Guard. Military leaders in Riyadh are asking why they need to fund roughly 250 Americans with the mission to train Saudis on the use of US military systems if Washington refuses to sell them US military systems anymore. Add to this that USMTM operates under State Department authorities rather than the Department of Defense (DOD).\n\n\"A reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship is a great excuse to clean up the US military footprint in the Kingdom. Its past time.\"\n\nTo achieve a win for all sides, the Biden administration could convert USMTM into a standard security cooperation office under the DODs Senior Defense Official for Saudi Arabia (as has been discussed since at least 2015), downsize to the staff necessary to run foreign military sales (FMS) cases, and redistribute remaining FMS administration billets to other locations. This would reduce the number of DOD personnel in Saudi Arabia, a win for members of Congress from both parties who are pressuring Biden to scale down the US militarys support for Saudi Arabia. It would modernize the structure of US security cooperation in the Kingdom, a win for the DOD. It would free up tens of millions of dollars in the Saudi defense budget, a little win for the Saudi ministry of defense. And it would preserve the US-Saudi strategic relationship, a win for the US administration.\n\nIf the vibe in Washington is that this approach is too soft, lets remind ourselves who the adversary actually is at the root of the kerfuffle over energy production and prices. (Hint: Its not Saudi Arabia.) Strengthening the United States partnerships abroad is a pillar of the new National Security Strategy precisely because its a proven method of securing US interests. Severing them is not.\n\nKirsten Fontenrose is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Councils Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.

                "cc_text": "It was a Russian oligarchs superyacht scudding towards Cape Town that brought global attention to South Africas refusal to condemn Russian aggression. A couple of weeks ago, both Cape Towns Mayor and the Premier of the Western Cape members of the opposition demanded that Alexey Mordashovs vessel be refused entry to South African territorial waters, where it was seeking sanctuary. The pair accused the oligarch, allegedly an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, of being an \"enabler\" in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNot happening, said Vincent Magwenya, spokesperson for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. There were no legal grounds for refusing the Nord docking permission. In this, he was right. But the row has served to remind us what drives the ruling African National Congresss policy towards Russia and its allies: ideology and nostalgia, self-interest and greed.\n\nThe old guard of the ruling African National Congress, who still haunt every crevice of government here, have not forgotten that Russian support was crucial in their 80-year anti-apartheid struggle, finally won in a negotiated settlement in 1994. Many of the ageing elites studied at Russian or Bloc country universities. They may have forgotten the USSRs egalitarian mantras in their rush to become wealthy, but nostalgia still lingers. The Russians have not been slow to capitalise on it.\n\nJacob Zuma, the disgraced former President currently facing criminal charges over alleged corruption in a 1999 arms deal, commissioned Russias Rosatom energy company to build eight nuclear plants in 2014. If completed, at a cost of 50 billion, the plants would have provided 23% of South Africas energy and given the Russians an effective stranglehold over the countrys economy. Karyn Maughan and Kirsten Pearson, in their 2022 book, Nuclear, suggest the deal was clinched after Zuma received medical treatment in Russia for poisoning. The former President alleged a toxin had been administered by one of his wives at the behest of the CIA. No proof of this poisoning has ever been provided, but there is plenty of evidence of a strong bond forged between presidents Zuma and Putin afterwards the latter reportedly knowing a bit about poisons.\n\nThe nuclear deal was eventually scuppered in April 2017, when the Western Cape High Court, in response to two applications from activist environmental groups, declared that any such agreement needed the approval of Parliament. The Treasury, which had opposed the deal as unaffordable and unlawful from the start, breathed a sigh of relief. The decision was, however, catastrophic for the finances of the ruling African National Congress. Even before Zumas tenure, many major donors to the partys coffers came from the legions of shady businesspeople who benefitted from what became grandly known as State Capture that is, put simply, the embezzlement of public money. The nuclear deal, dwarfing in nefarious intent the infamous 1999 arms deal in terms of potential kickbacks, would have set up the ANC for decades.\n\nWorse was to follow. The new President, Cyril Ramaphosa, launched a laudable if achingly tardy crack-down on corruption four years ago, insisting on transparency in party funding. This instantly deprived the ANC of its steady flow of murky money. And donations have dried up: the big corporations who had generously funded Ramaphosas bid to wrest the ANC leadership from Zuma in 2017 have long since given up on him, out of exasperation with his hesitant mismanagement of the country. Attempts to raise funds from within the party have also failed. The ANC and its supporting elites have proved in nearly three decades to be far better takers than givers.\n\nThe party is now technically bankrupt. Among other debts, it owes a court-ordered 1.5 million to a poster manufacturer for services rendered in the last elections. Staff are regularly unpaid, and they spontaneously strike and picket their own party conferences wreaking havoc on efforts to prepare for the crucial Elective Conference later this year, at which an embattled Ramaphosa will go for a second term. Neither can the partys former Treasurer General help much: he is fighting his own corruption charges relating to the procurement of protective equipment during the free-for-all that was South Africas Covid response.\n\nMuch conjecture surrounds the origin and purpose of a cache of dollar bills, allegedly worth in the millions, stolen two years ago from inside a sofa in Ramaphosas game lodge. The whistleblower was Arthur Fraser, the former head of Zumas privatised State Security Agency. Fraser also served as head of the prison services, during which time he unlawfully let Zuma out of prison on health grounds while he was serving a sentence for contempt of a commission into state corruption a commission which Zuma had himself appointed. Sound bizarre? Not for South Africans. The theft of the dollars is under a typically ponderous investigation by law enforcement authorities, but nobody expects a result before the Elective Conference. If the moola was intended as the ANCs bailout money, from whence came it?\n\nThe only discernible source of legitimate income for the ANC is via Chancellor House, the partys in-house investment company. Its biggest stake is in the South Africas fourth-largest manganese miner, United Manganese of Kalahari. UMK was the sole declared donor to the ANC in the 2021-22 financial year, to the tune of 500,000, as disclosed in the latest Parliamentary filings. And UMK wait for it is part-owned by the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselbergs conglomerate Renova Group.\n\nVekselberg ostensibly sold off his interest in UMK after sanctions were imposed on him by the United States in 2018: he ranks near the top of the United States Least Favourite Russians list, primarily for his inner-circle place in the Kremlin, and for leading a technology hub that was subsequently deemed by American authorities to be a front to access US intellectual property. But he remains invested in UMK through a new vehicle, a trust of which he owns 25%. And the oligarch may well object to the seizure of yachts: his motor yacht Tango was impounded in April by Spanish authorities.\n\nStill, it is not only these skeins of party and personal interest that inspire South Africas position on the Ukrainian invasion. At its heart lies something broader: realpolitik. South Africa is a proud member of the BRICS club, alongside Brazil, Russia, India and China. It is Africas token member of a group which is widely seen on the continent as a counterbalance to the historic power and influence of the developed western nations. The BRICSs New Development Bank, set up in 2014, has a loan book only slightly smaller than the World Banks, while not being encumbered by a $160 billion commitment to patch up Western economies after their self-immolation in the pandemic. Neither is 35% of its investment tied to the chimera of climate change mitigation.\n\nSouth Africa has a $25 billion share of the bank which has not been sapped, as the IMF has in propping up the euro. The Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) gives unlimited drawing rights to club members that need to stabilise their currencies. China and Russias foreign currency reserves are eight times larger than the US and Europes combined, give or take a few problems on Russias side in accessing its share while sanctions remain. China has the four largest banks in the world and owns 55% of the worlds shipping. Russia, despite having a Third World army, is self-sufficient in energy and food. These nations are, in short, worth keeping on-side.\n\nRussian trade only comprises a minuscule 0.4% of South Africas total trade and Russian investment in South Africa is a puny $1.5 billion compared to South Africas $5.13 billion stake in Russia. But South Africas dependence on Russia isnt straightforwardly economic. Rather, it stems from a need to keep the BRICS club happy, particularly China and India the latter having extensive personal and financial dealings with South Africas hugely entrepreneurial Asian minority, much of it through Dubai.\n\nChina has been investing heavily if not always ethically in Africa. So far it has sunk $70 billion in the continent, $25 billion in South Africa alone, creating an estimated 400,000 jobs. In February this year, it promised another $300 billion. The problem, a big one, is that its targets remain largely in the extractive industries and its practices are generally rip-and-run. There is little skill transference to the locals and limited social investment. And the increasing number of expatriate Chinese workers-turned-settlers do not easily assimilate wherever they land in the continent.\n\nSouth Africa still takes money where it can find it: most recently $497 million from the World Bank to bail out its crippled electricity grid, and $4.3 billion from the IMF in emergency post-pandemic support. But the financial and fraternal allure of the BRICS club to South Africa is still overwhelming and it is more important, Ramaphosas government firmly believes, than taking sides in a distant, intra-Slav war over an old border dispute. Besides, the argument goes, why should South Africa trust the US and Europe? A fair question, given Americas friends once included Vietnam, Iran, Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq.\n\nSo, while Russia moves to the next stage of total and irreversible war and China uses the pandemic as an excuse to keep its borders shut and reduce its exposure to the global economy, South Africa, like many other non-aligned nations, is manoeuvring. The aim is to be on the winning side of the real conflict behind the one involving tanks: the battle between old Western and new Eastern money. And while that battle is playing out, no fugitive Russian super yacht is ever going to be refused safe harbour in Cape Town.",

                "cc_text": "It is no secret that arms control is becoming a lost art. While the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were filled with strategic arms control talks, only one treaty limiting nuclear arsenals has entered into force over the past two decades: New START (the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Notwithstanding the innovations in its verification regime, the treaty relied heavily on the existing principles of the original START Treaty, together with many of the core players experiences negotiating and ratifying it 20 years earlier.\n\nSince then, however, Russias Putin era and, with it, the growing distrust between Russia and the United States, as well as the retirement of Cold War and post-Cold War arms control experts, have stalled any progress. Other treaties such as the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF Treaty) have been abandoned, and other nuclear-armed states remain outside arms limitation agreements. Despite new technologies and a new security architecture requiring more thought than ever before, substantive proposals and good faith negotiations have been replaced by empty talking points. Additionally, in recent years both the United States and Russia have engaged in unconstructive blaming and shaming efforts, which have further soured the arms control environment and lowered the political will for pursuing negotiations in good faith.\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon advance proportional efforts to overcome these forces, it is only prudent to expect that February 4, 2026 will be the last day of bilateral strategic arms control (Albertson 2021, 78). As a first step, the United States and Russia, on August 25, 2022, submitted a statement to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT Review Conference) committing to \"pursue negotiations in good faith on a successor framework to New START before its expiration in 2026, in order to achieve deeper, irreversible, and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals\" (2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 2022). But that commitment so far appears to be blocked by the dispute over Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nTreaty history\n\n1972/1979: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II)\n\nNuclear arms limitation treaties emerged during a period of intense buildup of US and Soviet strategic nuclear forces. In the late 1960s, the United States realized that the Soviet Union was building up its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) forces to reach parity with the United States and had also begun to construct a limited anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense system around Moscow. Concerned that Russia might eventually be able to launch a first strike and then block US retaliation, President Lyndon Johnson called for strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The hope was that US-Soviet relations could be stabilized through limits on the development of both offensive and defensive strategic systems (US Department of State 2022).\n\nBy 1972, the Soviets were convinced that defensive systems had limitations, allowing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and SALT I to be negotiated and enter into force. SALT I was considered an interim agreement that consisted of a simple freeze, not yet including on-site inspections. Its verification relied on national technical means, referring to intelligence satellites and related capabilities. However, the term was officially left undefined to protect intelligence methods and avoid offending Soviet sensibilities (Gottemoeller 2021, 2; Aftergood 2019).\n\nIn 1979, the United States and the Soviet Union completed the negotiation of SALT II which set a limit of 2,400 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (including ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers), banned the construction of new ICBMs, and limited the number of multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to 1,320. However, the treaty never entered into force due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as well as some US senators criticisms of the Soviet Unions crackdown on internal dissent, the Soviets increasingly interventionist foreign policies, the treatys verification process, and SALT IIs failure to sufficiently limit Soviet MIRV technology that would allow missiles to carry multiple warheads (US Department of State n.d.; Cameron 2022). Nonetheless, both sides agreed to voluntarily observe the SALT II-negotiated limits in subsequent years (US Department of State n.d.).\n\nAs former US Secretary of Defense and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Gates noted, the process itself was likely the most useful part of these talks: \"For the first time, the two sides sat down and began a dialogue about their nuclear weapons and, implicitly, their nuclear strategies. Military and civilian leaders on both sides were able to take the measure of one another and, at the same time, engage their political leaders in an unprecedented way in learning about the balance of terror\" (Gates 1996, 45).\n\n1991: Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\n\nPartially due to the further development of MIRV technology on both sides, the Americans and Soviets realized that strategic systems had to be reduced to prevent either sides out-deployment in warhead numbers. This realization led to the 1980s Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), which eventually became the first ratified treaty that required US and Russian reductionsrather than a mere freezeof strategic nuclear weapons. The START Treaty, signed in 1991 with entry into force three years later, limited both countries to 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 6,000 warheads attributed to ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, and included more detailed sub-limits. Once Russia believed that the benefits of on-site inspections outweighed their concerns over giving the United States reciprocal access, nothing was standing in the way of a verifiable arms control treaty to create more predictability. The detailed verification regime of START, including databases, notifications, and on-site inspections, allowed both sides to better calculate necessary deterrence investments while preventing an arms race (Gottemoeller 2021, 3).\n\nThe United States and Russia subsequently negotiated and signed START II in 1993, committing to additional reductions down to 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers by the end of 2007. Importantly, the treaty included a ban on multiple warheads on ICBMs. While the treaty never entered into force despite a decade-long bilateral effort, it strongly shaped the US Strategic Commands long-term force structure planning (Kristensen 2001, 12).\n\n2002: the Moscow Treaty (SORT)\n\nUnder the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), also called the Moscow Treaty, Russia and the United States agreed in 2002 to further reduce their nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic warheads each by December 31, 2012a nearly two-third reduction from the START I limits. While progressive in its numerical limits, SORT was a very simple treaty, with its text barely exceeding one page and not providing any separate verification measures. Instead, Russia and the United States decided they would continue to rely on START to provide verification until its expiration in December 2009 (US Department of State 2002).\n\n2010: the New START Treaty\n\nFinally, the New START Treaty (officially the \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\") succeeded in further limiting the US- and Russian- deployed long-range nuclear forces down to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery vehiclesthe lowest in over 60 years. For that purpose, New START for the first time counted the actual number of warheads found on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, rather than mathematically calculating numbers based on missile tests as in START. Since bombers do not carry nuclear weapons under normal circumstances, each deployed heavy bomber was attributed one warhead by default to make bombers accountable under the treaty (US Department of State 2010). Therefore, the warheads attributed to bombers do not reflect actual warhead loadsunlike for missiles. Delivery vehicles under New START encompass deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear armaments. It was not until far into the negotiations that Russia and the United States determined these numbers, with Russia originally asking for more warheads while the United States requested more delivery vehicles to protect its advantage in that area (Gottemoeller 2021, 34).\n\nIn addition to the further reduction of these limits, New START created an entirely new limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers. Although this concept was originally introduced by Russia, the United States later embraced the idea as it would, first, prevent Russia from building and storing unlimited numbers of mobile missile launchers since these would count toward the non-deployed limit, and, second, provide the United States with the flexibility to convert bombers to conventional use and overhaul submarines since these would not count under the deployed limits during those processes (Gottemoeller 2021, 83, 112).\n\nAnother aspect of New STARTs flexibility is the preserved \"freedom to mix,\" where each side can decide the composition and structure of its strategic offensive forces if it stays below the total limits. Russia, being a great land power, could continue to rely primarily on ICBMs. On the contrary, the United States, being a sea power, was able to keep more SLBMs than Russia (Gottemoeller 2021, 32). The mix chosen by the United States included no more than 400 deployed ICBMs, no more than 240 deployed SLBMs, and no more than 60 deployed heavy bombers. Beyond an additional 100 non-deployed launchers, a significant number of excess launchers had to be denuclearized or destroyed. Because Russia had significantly fewer launchers than the United States, it did not have to reduce its deployed force.\n\nMost importantly, however, the New START Treaty created what has often been referred to as the \"gold standard\" of verification: procedures governing the conversion and elimination of strategic offensive arms, the establishment and operation of a database of treaty-required information, transparency measures, a commitment not to interfere with national technical means of verification, the exchange of telemetric information, the conduct of on-site inspection activities, and the operation of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) (US Department of State 2022).\n\nInnovations in New STARTs verification regime managed to address both sides concerns about the old START treatys verification regime while better balancing information and burdena core military interest on both sides.\n\nFirst, it streamlined STARTs more burdensome verification regime into two types of verifications: one for deployed systems (Type One) and the other for non-deployed systems (Type Two). They largely encompassed the aspects of previously separate types of inspectionsresulting in slightly longer but much less frequent (up to ten Type One and up to eight Type Two) short-notice on-site inspections annually. This solution fulfilled both militaries interest in avoiding too frequent or overly intrusive inspections that could disrupt operational tempo for days (Gottemoeller 2021, 50).\n\nSecond, it enabled real-time tracking of each others forces by introducing unique identifying numbers for launchers and delivery vehicles, utilizing the existing serial numbers each country already used to track and account for its weapons. This gave inspectors a clear idea of the weapons they needed to find at each site (Gottemoeller 2021, 52).\n\nThird, New START addressed rising cost and accuracy concerns about the conversion and elimination of certain weapon systems. To allow satellites to confirm eliminations, for instance, it determined space and time requirements for displaying eliminated missiles and other treaty accountable items and established the right to request reciprocal inspections of such. To address US concerns about overcounting delivery vehicles under the previous treaty, New START also introduced simplified measures to confirm US conversion and elimination processes, particularly the conversion of all B-1 bombers to conventional-only platforms, the conversion of submarine tubes, and the total elimination of B-52 bombers (Gottemoeller 2021, 121122).\n\nIn the end, while Russia had originally urged for a simpler treaty like SORT, it has praised New START as the \"gold standard\" for verification (Alexander and Ferraro 2010).\n\nThe treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011, and provided the parties with seven years to reduce their forces to these agreed-upon limits. Both sides successfully met the central limits by February 5, 2018, and have since stayed at or below them. Russia and the United States extended the originally 10-year treaty to its maximum 15-year length, now set to expire on February 4, 2026 (US Department of State 2022).\n\nTable 1 compares the limits and verification mea- sures from SALT I to New START.\n\nThe New START Treaty remains in force through February 4, 2026. If no follow-on agreement is concluded before its expiration, then February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals. In other words, anyone under the age of 54 will, for the first time, live in a world without strategic arms control.\n\nShort of a new treaty, Russia and the United States would lose mutual predictability and trust. It would also mean that military planners would have to rely more on worst-case scenarios, subsequently accelerating defense spending that could result in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nSuch a gloomy future is, of course, avoidable. The United States and Russia have several options available to maintain strategic limitations on their arsenals, includingin order of increasing resulting predictability but decreasing feasibilitycontinued adherence through mutual moratoria, the negotiation of a new executive agreement, or the conclusion of an entirely new treaty.\n\nWe explore each one of these three options in this issue. But, to illustrate the urgency with which both countries should pursue them, we first offer a realistic scenario of how US and Russian arsenals could evolve if the current trends remain unchangedthat is, if the last bilateral arms control treaty still active is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement.\n\nThe arms race in high gear\n\nUp until now, both countries have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that both countries will not exceed the force levels dictated by New START. Without bilateral arms control, however, this planning will be thrown into an era of unpredictability and distrust. Both sides would need to reassess their programs to accommodate more uncertain nuclear futures. This would likely result in worst-case scenario planning based on fewer data points and the uncertainty of future force levelsincluding those that would likely exceed New START levels. This could drive significant increases in both countries arsenals, and ultimately lead to mutual accusations of arms racing and international accusations of NPT violations.\n\nThe United States and Russia each have significant numbers of additional nuclear warheads in storage that cannot be loaded on the launchers because of the New START limit of 1,550 deployed warheads. If New START fell away, these warheads could be uploaded in days, weeks, or months, depending on the type of launcher.\n\nThe United States has a significant upload capacity for its deployed missiles. Although all 400 of its deployed ICBMs currently only carry a single warhead, 200 of these use the Mk-12A reentry vehicle and are therefore capable of carrying up to three W78 warheads each. Moreover, the United States has an additional 50 \"warm\" ICBM silos which could be reloaded with missiles if necessary. If the 200 Mk-12A-equipped missiles were uploaded to three warheads each and the 50 reloaded missiles were also equipped with three warheads each, the ICBM force loading could potentially increase from 400 to 950 warheads. In the absence of treaty limitations, the United States could also upload each of its deployed Trident SLBMs with a full complement of eight warheads, rather than the current average of four to five. It could also reactivate the four launch tubes on each nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN)56 in totalthat were disabled under New START. This could potentially more than double the number of deployed US SLBM warheads from approximately 944 today to approximately 2,300 warheads.\n\nEither of these actions would likely take months to complete, particularly given the complexities involved with uploading additional warheads on ICBMs. Moreover, ballistic missile submarines would have to return to port for uploading on a rotating schedule. However, deploying additional warheads to US bomber bases could be done very quickly, and the United States could potentially upload nearly 700 cruise missiles and bombs on B-52 and B-2 bombers.\n\nRussia also has a significant upload capacity, especially for its ICBMs. Russias 40 SS-18 Satan ICBMs can carry up to ten MIRVs; however, it is assumed that they have been downloaded to carry only five to meet the New START limitations. The incoming RS-28 Sarmat ICBM is also reportedly capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs; however, it is assumed that these too will be downloaded upon their deployment if the New START force limits are retained. The SS-27 Yars is also assumed to have been downloaded from four MIRVs to three. As a result, without the limits imposed by New START, Russias ICBM force could potentially increase from approximately 812 warheads to approximately 1,185 warheads.\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles on Russian Borei-class SSBNs are also thought to have been downloaded from an estimated six warheads to four to meet New START limits. Without these limitations, the number of deployed warheads on Russian SSBNs could rise from an estimated 576 to approximately 800. As in the US case, Russian bombers could be loaded relatively quickly with hundreds of nuclear weapons. The number is highly uncertain but assuming approximately 50 bombers are operational, the number of weapons could potentially be increased to nearly 600.\n\nTable 2 considers how both US and Russian strategic nuclear forces could increase if New START is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement in place. If both countries uploaded their delivery systems to accommodate the maximum number of possible warheads, both sets of arsenals would approximately double in size. The United States would have slightly more deployable strategic warheads but Russia would still have a significantly larger arsenal of operational nuclear weapons, given its sizable stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear warheads.\n\nTable 2 presents a worst-case scenario for possible warhead uploads if New START is allowed to expire without any follow-on. Because of the relatively low estimated cost of a simple upload across the triad (about $100 million in one-time costs to the United States), this scenario is not impossible from a budgeting perspective (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3).\n\nIn the longer term, both countries could theoretically go further and pursue costly larger expansions of their strategic nuclear forces, such as going back up to the START I level of 6,000 warheads each. Some voices in the United States have already raised doubts about the New START force limits because of Chinas nuclear buildup (Miller 2022). Depending on the desired degree of flexibility and the cost of new strategic delivery systems, such an expansion could cost the United States, for instance, between $88 billion to $439 billion in one-time acquisition costs, plus $4 billion to $28 billion in annual operation and sustainment costs (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3). This does not even include research and development costs or the Department of Energys costs to produce, sustain, or store more nuclear warheads. It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive.\n\nMoreover, there are expected consequences beyond the offensive strategic nuclear forces that New START regulates. If the verification regime and data exchanges elapse, both countries are likely to enhance their intelligence capabilities to make up for the uncertainty regarding the other sides nuclear forces. Both countries are also likely to invest more into what they perceive will increase their overall military capabilities, such as conventional missile forces, nonstrategic nuclear forces, and missile defense (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 79). These would all come with significant additional costs.\n\nOverall, todays technologies and the geopolitical situation would likely lead to a different style of arms racing than during the Cold War; however, it could similarly become unnecessarily costly and dangerous. Moreover, it could trigger reactions in other nuclear-armed states that might also decide to increase their nuclear forces and the role they play in their military strategies. The good news is that this future is certainly not inevitableeven without a formalized treaty structure beyond 2026. The following sections offer a series of options for both countries that would help prevent an escalation of the arms race. The estimated success of each option depends upon a variety of factors, including political will, legal complexities, and relative degrees of formalization. The following sections are listed in order of their projected feasibility, and thus begin with Plan Cthe most feasible but least sustainable optionand end with Plan A the most challenging yet most optimal outcome.\n\nPlan C: continued adherence to New STARTs core provisions beyond 2026\n\nOne option would be for both countries to simply continue abiding by the core provisions of the treatyeven without the treaty being formally in effect. Such a \"gentlemans agreement\" could be made by the leaders of both the United States and Russia without legislative approval, as opposed to a formal treaty. By agreeing to not exceed the New START limits, each side could continue its current strategic force structure planning and therefore avoid a costly expansion.\n\nSuch an agreement, however, also comes with challenges. Practically, the United States and Russia could certainly continue to adhere to the treaty limitsmuch as they did for a brief period of four months in the interim between START and New START. But without the legal structure of a treaty, the main verification benefits of New STARTdata exchanges, notifications, and inspections could be lost due to the legal difficulties surrounding classified information. This could force both parties to rely exclusively on national technical means for verification, which would severely strain both the resources and capabilities of their respective intelligence communities.\n\nWe now examine the feasibility of this option.\n\nCould bilateral data exchanges and notifications continue after 2026?\n\nWithout a treaty framework to enable the legal exchange of otherwise classified or restricted nuclear weapons data, both Russia and the United States would need to prepare legal avenues to allow them to continue sharing this information. According to former New START chief US negotiator, Rose Gottemoeller, the United States continued notifications as a goodwill gesture and was willing to continue data exchanges during the bridge period between START and New START (Gottemoeller 2022). Given this precedent, it should again be feasible for the United States to legally arrange for data exchanges and notifications. On the other side, Russia did not continue reciprocal notifications during the interim period, despite its promise to continue abiding by the treatys limits. To that end, Russia will need to examine whether it might need to first amend its domestic laws concerning the sharing of classified nuclear information.\n\nCould bilateral on-site inspections continue after 2026?\n\nThe question of on-site inspections continuing beyond the scope of a formalized treaty has been considered by Gottemoeller. In her book, Negotiating the New START Treaty, she notes that:\n\n\"The Russians also raised doubts about the legal status of such an agreement. According to them, they needed a full, legally-binding treaty, duly approved by their State Duma and Federation Council, in order to override their domestic law and permit foreign inspectors. According to the Russian state security law, no foreigners are allowed in sensitive nuclear facilities. A treaty can override that domestic law\" (Gottemoeller 2021, 8586).\n\nThe United States also has laws restricting the access of foreign nationals to sensitive military installations. These too could be overridden by an international treaty, as has been the case with New START.\n\nIt would theoretically be possible for both countries to change their domestic laws to enable on-site inspections to continue in the absence of a treaty framework. There is precedent for attempting this in the United States: In 2009, facing the possibility that START might expire without a follow-on treaty in place, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) brought to the table a bill specifically designed to provide Russian inspectors with the ability to continue on-site inspections for seven months or until the entry into force of a new bilateral treatywhichever came first (S.2727 2009). The bill was ultimately not passed, but its introduction to Congress suggests that a similar path could be considered again if necessary. Such a bill could specifically require the continued implementation of the expired treatys verification protocol and annexes that contain highly detailed instructions for how on-site inspections are to be conducted, including requisite flight paths, aircraft call signs, customs exemptions, lodging, accommodations, and the according of diplomatic immunity upon each partys inspectors and aircrew, among other granular details.\n\nIn the absence of a follow-on treaty, rather than attempting to maintain all existing verification mechanisms, another option could be to reduce the scope of the verification regime altogether. While conventional wisdom holds that more verification is always better, recent scholarship indicates that this may not always be the case. In his doctoral dissertation, political scientist Andrew Reddie posits that \"the most intrusive types of verification are not, as is currently believed, more likely to lead to compliance\" (Reddie 2019). Instead, Reddies analysisbased on more than 1,000 agreement-years of historical datasuggests that highly intrusive inspections could yield a statistically significant greater likelihood of noncompliance than less intrusive types of verification regimes. Reddie suggests that this phenomenon could be the result of a \"surveillance bias,\" in which it is possible that \"a hammer (representing a verification regime) will constantly search for and find a nail (noncompliance). Thus, those agreements that have a more stringent verification mechanisma larger hammermay have a higher probability of detecting non-compliance\" (Reddie 2019).\n\nIf a reduction in the intrusiveness of the treatys verification regime would not necessarily increase the likelihood of noncompliance, both parties could use the opportunity of New STARTs expiration to possibly reduce the invasiveness of future verification mechanisms. This would avoid unwanted challenges triggered by the loss of the treatys inspection protocols once it expires while continuing to adhere to its core provisions and central limits. For example, the United States and Russia could place a hold on conducting Type One and Type Two inspections but continue to exchange compliance data and promise not to interfere with the other partys national technical means of verification.\n\nEven though after New START expires there would be no legal requirement to comply with the treatys core provisions, both countries would still likely have strong normative and geopolitical incentives to continue doing so. This is partially because of the riskeven without on-site inspectionsthat any increase would be detected and exposed by the other sides national technical means. Moreover, during the treatys history, there have been several extended periods when Type One and Type Two inspections were suspendedmost notably during the Covid-19 pandemic, when inspections were paused for nearly two years. During these periods there were no accusations of noncompliance by either side.\n\nA reduction of the verification regime may not necessarily create a compliance problem, but it could create a political one. Historically, Congress has been more amenable to support and provide the resources to implement agreements with robust verification regimes, whereas agreements with relatively looser verification mechanisms, such as SORT or the US-Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have faced fierce resistance. This challenge could be exacerbated by relying exclusively on national technical means for verification, which could potentially result in the intelligence community issuing ranged estimates of Russian warheads and delivery systems rather than knowing the exact numbers of warheads and launchers. Even though using a range in place of a definite number may not significantly affect the United States deterrence calculations, it could produce a domestic political backlash. For instance, if the ranges upper boundary ever came too close to the treatys central limits, the public debate would most likely crystalize over such a high-end estimate and cast doubt about Russias compliance. This challenge is evident in the current debate about how many non-strategic nuclear warheads Russia has. Because these warheads are not limited and declared under a treaty, the US Intelligence Community uses a range of 1,0002,000 warheads, of which the Pentagon uses the higher number, even though the Department of State says it includes retired warheads (US Department of State 2022, 11).\n\nUnder such a \"gentlemans agreement,\" any previously existing protocols to facilitate dispute resolution between the state parties would no longer be formally in effect. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC)the joint body authorized to resolve compliance questions, make technical changes to the treatys protocol and annexes as new weapons are deployed, and mediate other treaty-related disputeswould be officially defunct upon New STARTs expiration. As a result, if one party accused the other of materially breaching the agreement, there would be no formal mechanism for mediating and resolving that dispute. This challenge could be mitigated by the establishment of a new mechanism that mirrors the current role of the BCC.\n\nIn effect, continuing to adhere to New STARTs core provisions would be an informal way of extending the treatys benefits. While this informality would certainly create challenges, the tacit knowledge and practices learned through 15 years of successful New START implementation could help transition both parties into such a new framework. While this option may not be sustainable in the long term, it could be considered a short-term bridge between New START and a follow-on agreement. This could prove particularly useful in the interim period if a mutual political commitment to the treaty remains, but time runs out before a new agreement can be concluded.\n\n*************\n\nAnother obstacle to a non-legally binding handshake agreement is Russias historical insistence on having formally ratified treaties. For instance, Gottemoeller explained that Russia previously rejected a non-legally-binding bridging agreement after START, as it was afraid this would take away the necessary pressure needed to eventually reach a ratified treaty with the United States (Gottemoeller 2022). Russias insistence on formally ratified treaties may also be motivated by its fear that a future US administration could easily pull out of a negotiated executive deal. It is not known how flexible Russia might be today given the diminished likelihood that a two-thirds majority of the US Senate will vote to ratify an arms control treaty with Russia, particularly in the context of Putins invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPlan B: pursuing an executive agreement\n\nAnother option for the United States could be to conclude a follow-on (sole presidential or congressional) executive agreement that would not require the Senates advice and consent for ratification as an Article II treaty would, but would still be as legally binding. Today, more than 90 percent of the United States international agreements are executive agreements concluded by the president (Bradley and Goldsmith 2018, 1278). In the field of arms control, however, executive agreements are still largely unexplored.\n\nA distinctive advantage of pursuing an executive agreement over an Article II treaty is that it would allow each countrys head of state to bypass the Senates advice and consent required for Article II treaty ratification. This would be particularly valuable for the United States given the high degree of political polarization and low likelihood of bipartisan Senate support.\n\nThe flip side of this advantage for the United States, however, is that bypassing Congress in this way could create political backlash for a president. Congress could potentially block funding for a president to implement an executive agreement with Russia or even hold other presidential priorities at risk.\n\nMoreover, if such an executive agreement included anything that could be construed to be a \"further arms reduction,\" it could be challenged under the US Arms Control and Disarmament Act:\n\n\"No action shall be taken pursuant to this chapter or any other Act that would obligate the United States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution or unless authorized by the enactment of further affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States\" (22 USC Ch. 35, Section 2573(b) 1961).\n\nA sole-presidential executive agreement inherently has substantially less congressional buy-in than a treaty ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. Similar to politically-binding agreements, such an executive agreement is likely to be associated directly with the president who concluded it and could therefore be subject to violation or withdrawal by a subsequent president wanting to distinguish themselves from their predecessor. The fate of the JCPOA between the United States and Iranin this case a politically- and not legally-binding agreementexemplifies this dynamic. In 2018, against the advice of nonproliferation experts and many of his own advisors, President Donald Trump violated the agreement mainly because of its association with his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who signed the deal in 2015. This can be contrasted with the fate of New START, which was also negotiated under the Obama administration but remained relatively insulated from President Trumps pattern of withdrawing from treaties and agreementspartly because of New STARTs continued bipartisan support within Congress, particularly from those who voted in favor of the treaty in 2010.\n\nA more politically-sound and -sustainable solution might be a congressional executive agreement that would require a simple majority vote in both the Senate and House.\n\nPlan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\n\nThe ideal option for maintaining transparency, predictability, and mutual limitations of US and Russian nuclear arsenals would be the conclusion of a follow-on treaty to replace New START. That is also the least feasible option, especially as bilateral talks have been placed on hold since Russia invaded Ukraine. Nonetheless, a thorough consideration of each countrys respective arms control priorities could yield some opportunities for common ground when negotiations eventually resume.\n\nIn June 2022, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, Mallory Stewart, described the United States current arms control priorities vis--vis Russia as follows: \"We want to sustain limits beyond 2026 on the Russian systems covered under new START; we want to limit the new kinds of nuclear systems Russia is developing; and we want to address all Russian nuclear weapons, including theater-range weapons\" (Stewart 2022).\n\nPriority one: maintaining strategic limits after New START\n\nThe United States first prioritysustaining mutual limitations beyond 2026is likely to be shared by Russia. Both countries are aware of each others significant strategic upload capacities upon New STARTs expiration, such that each country could more than double their total deployed strategic war- heads in the absence of existing limitations (see \"The arms race in high gear\" section). However, neither side appears to have the political appetite or economic capacity to engage in a strategic arms buildup.\n\nRussias significant interest in preserving the bilateral arms control regime was on full display in the months and weeks leading up to New STARTs extension in 2021. As Andrey Baklitskiy wrote at the time for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace:\n\n\"Both chambers of parliament voted on the extension in just one day, and passed it unanimously. Such speed and consensuslast seen over the annexation of Crimea back in 2014shows how important arms control is to the Russian leadership. [. . .] Recently, it has become fashionable in Russias expert circles to opine that traditional arms control is obsolete as a concept, and doesnt correspond to the reality of the modern world. This view partly stems from the fact that existing treaties have disappeared one after the other, while Moscow has not held talks on a new one for more than a decade. The energy the Russian state has put into supporting arms control efforts, along with the first progress made on this front, could now put an end to that trend\" (Baklitskiy 2021).\n\nPriority two: addressing Russias \"exotic\" new nuclear systems\n\nThe United States second prioritylimiting Russias newer nuclear systemswill pose a greater challenge than maintaining the existing limits beyond 2026, but not an insurmountable one. In March 2018, President Putin unveiled a suite of \"exotic\" new nuclear systemsincluding the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, and the Status-6 Poseidon nuclear torpedoimmediately prompting concerns from US lawmakers that these systems would not be covered by New START limitations (President of Russia 2018; Cotton 2019).\n\nWhile some of these systems do pose arms control challenges, two of themSarmat and Avangardappear to be covered by the treaty. The New START protocols have clear provisions for including \"new types\" of strategic ICBMs within the framework of the treaty, and given that Sarmat has already been tested and is scheduled to be deployed by the end of 2022, Russia will have already provided many of the requisite prototype notifications to the United States (Al Jazeera 2022). In a similar vein, the United States incoming LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM will also enter the treaty smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, Avangard is not a particularly complex case: the hypersonic glide vehicle is carried by treaty-accountable ICBMs and the system itself meets New STARTs definition of a \"re-entry vehicle\" under the description \"that part of the front section that can survive reentry through the dense layers of the Earths atmosphere and that is designed for delivering a weapon to a target or for testing such a delivery\" (US Department of State 2010, 60(7)). As a result, any ICBMs deployed with the Avangard system are now counted toward the central limits for both launchers and warheads.\n\nBoth the United States and Russia seem to agree on how New START will consider these two systems. In 2019, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Andrea Thompson, stated in congressional testimony that: \"We assess at least two of them, the Sarmat heavy ICBM and Avangard hypersonic system would count as existing types and be subject to New START at the appropriate point in their development cycle\" (Thompson 2019). Six months later, the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministrys nonproliferation and arms control department, Vladimir Leontiev, stated at the Valdai Discussion Club:\n\n\"As far as new Russian systems are concerned, the situation is dual. There are two systems that clearly fall under the treaty. First, the Sarmat, which can be easily included in the treaty as a new type ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile), for which there is a special procedure, from the creation of a prototype to its authorization for service. [. . .] There are no big problems with Avangard, either, because it is an optional warhead for an ICBM of the corresponding type, to which the treaty applies, too. [. . .] The Avangard will enter the Treaty very smoothly\" (TASS 2019).\n\nThe statuses of the three other new Russian delivery systemsBurevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhalare less obvious. Neither Burevestnik nor Poseidon are likely to be deployed before New STARTs expiration in February 2026; however, it is worth examining whether any of these would fall under the treatys existing counting rules, given that these could form the basis for a potential follow-on agreement.\n\nArticle V of New START stipulates that: \"When a Party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging, that Party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the Bilateral Consultative Commission.\" The treatys supplementary protocol specifies what constitutes a \"new\" kind of strategic offensive weapon:\n\n\"The term new type means, for ICBMs or SLBMs, a type of ICBM or a type of SLBM, the technical characteristics of which differ from the technical characteristics of an ICBM or SLBM, respectively, of each type declared previously in at least one of the following respects: (a) Number of stages. (b) Type of propellant of any stage. (c) Either the length of the assembled missile without front section or the length of the first stage, by more than three percent. (d) Diameter of the first stage, by more than three percent\" (US Department of State 2010, 46(42)).\n\nIt is unclear whether this definition applies to any of Burevestnik, Poseidon, or Kinzhal, given that none could be considered ICBMs or SLBMs. Burevestnik is a cruise missile, Poseidon is a type of underwater torpedo, and Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile. Moreover, at least two of these systems do not travel on ballistic trajectories, placing them outside the treatys definition of either an \"intercontinental ballistic missile\" or a \"submarine-launched ballistic missile,\" regardless of their launch systems or strategic roles in Russias nuclear arsenal.\n\nHowever, in 2019, then-Under Secretary Thompson added during her congressional testimony that all three \"meet the US criteria for what constitutes a new kind of strategic offensive arms for purposes of New START\" (Thompson 2019).\n\nThis interpretation is not likely to be shared by Russia. In December 2018, Russian officials sent a notice to the United States stating that they \"find it inappropriate to characterize new weapons being developed by Russia that do not use ballistic trajectories of flight moving to a target as potential new kinds of Russian strategic offensive arms. The arms presented by the President of the Russian Federation on March 1, 2018, have nothing to do with the strategic offensive arms categories covered by the Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nIn its notice, Russia asserted that because none of the Burevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhal delivery systems are ICBMs, SLBMs, or heavy bombers, they fall outside the scope of the treaty. The statement also noted that \"the Russian approach to the issue of criteria for defining new kinds of strategic offensive arms for the purposes of this Treaty is being worked at. The Russian Side is open for dialogue on this topic although it does not consider it as a priority taking into account pressing issues of the Treaty implementation discussed currently in the Bilateral Consultative Commission\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nThe complex case for counting Kinzhal under the treaty framework depends entirely upon whether its carrier aircraft fits the treaty definition of an accountable \"heavy bomber.\" The treatys protocol states that an aircraft counts as a \"heavy bomber\" if it either (a) has a combat (meaning unrefueled) range of more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) or (b) is equipped for nuclear air-launched cruise missiles with a range exceeding 600 kilometers (370 miles) (US Department of State 2010, 23(80)). Given that Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile, it does not satisfy the latter criterion. However, depending on how Russia intends to deploy the system, it could satisfy the former criterion.\n\nRussia deploys Kinzhal on its specially-modified MiG-31IK Foxhound aircraft and has used the system in combat at least three times during its invasion of Ukraine (Kristensen and Korda 2022a; TASS 2022). The MiG-31IKs combat range is estimated to be approximately 1,250 kilometers (770 miles)significantly below the 8,000-kilometer threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000a). As Pranay Vaddi, now Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, wrote in 2019 for Lawfare: \"In this case, Kinzhal would not be accountable under New START, and neither should it be. Because the MiG-31 has a very limited range, it is not, even when armed with Kinzhal, the kind of strategic weapon that New START was intended to limit. Rather, if Kinzhal is deployed on a MiG-31, it will likely fill a limited, theater-strike role\" (Vaddi 2019).\n\nHowever, news reports have indicated that Russia may also deploy Kinzhal on its longer-range Tu-22M3M Backfire bombers (TASS 2018; RIA Novosti 2018). The upgraded Tu-22M3Ms are currently not classified as \"heavy bombers\" under New START because they are estimated to have a combat range of approximately 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles), whichif correctremains below the 8,000-kilometer (4,971 miles) threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000b). The United States raised concerns about the upgraded Tu-22M3M system to Russia in September 2018, to which Russia responded as follows:\n\n\"The Russian side indeed plans to carry out modernization of Tu-22M3 bomber to the modification Tu-22M3M. This modernization will prolong the service life of the aircraft, as well as improve its systems of maneuverability, navigation and use of air weapon systems. At the same time, the range of the bomber will be below 8000 km, and it will not be equipped for nuclear [air-launched cruise missiles] with range exceeding 600 km. Proceeding from the aforementioned facts, the technical characteristics of the Tu-22M3M aircraft in accordance with paragraph 23 (80) of Part One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty do not allow to classify it as a heavy bomber and it will not fall under the limitations of the New START Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nWhile the combat range of the upgraded Tu-22M3M may remain below 8,000 kilometers, it appears that the modernized aircraft will likely have probes to facilitate mid-air refueling (Interfax 2018). This is a significant alteration of the aircraft that will allow it to potentially reach intercontinental ranges. For this reason, these probes had been previously removed from Russias Tu-22M aircraft under the SALT II process, and the Soviet Union had made a politically binding declaration on July 31, 1991, that \"it will not give the Tu-22M airplane the capability of operating at intercontinental distances in any manner, including by in-flight refueling\" (Vance 1979; US Department of State 1991). However, this long-standing policy appears to now have been reversed, with defense sources telling Interfax in 2018 that: \"The new refueling equipment will significantly increase Tu-22M3Ms combat radius and range of operation. The range will be comparable with one of strategic bombers\" (Interfax 2018).\n\nWhile this may not technically trigger the reclassification of the Kinzhal/Tu-22M3M combination as a treaty-accountable \"heavy bomber\" given that the aircrafts unrefueled range is still likely to remain below the 8,000-kilometer threshold, the de facto transformation of a medium-range aircraft into an intercontinental-range aircraft could be enough for the United States to raise the matter at the BCC or in other bilateral forums. Moreover, in the context of negotiating a follow-on treaty, the United States could seek to close this potential loophole by addressing the fact that mid-flight refueling capabilities could theoretically turn a tactical bomber into a strategic one.\n\nPriority three: addressing all Russian nuclear weapons\n\nThe United States third prioritylimiting all of Russias nuclear weaponslikely poses the greatest challenge given the difficulty of verification and existing force asymmetry.\n\nThe United States is likely aware of the challenge, thus phrasing its goal to \"address all Russian nuclear weapons\" rather broadly. This could, for a start, be achieved through unverified data exchanges. Nonetheless, any negotiations that concern non-strategic nuclear warheads will be complicated by the asymmetry of Russia having up to 10 times more non-strategic nuclear warheads than the United States (1,912 compared to 200) (Kristensen and Korda 2022a, 2022b). Were Russia willing to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in a treaty, it would likely ask for US concessions in another area, although it has not specified so far what this might be. The Russian government did state, however, that a precondition for discussing non-strategic nuclear weapons is that the United States withdraws such weapons from Europe (Berestovaya 2021). Other areas of asymmetry Russia could try to pull into a negotiation package might concern US missile defenses and conventional weapons.\n\nExacerbated by existing political tensions and the current arms control deadlock between the two countries, this issue is not likely to be resolved anytime soon. Rather, an effort to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in an arms control treaty could require several years of negotiations and confidence-buildingpossibly spanning multiple presidential administrations.\n\nLessons learned and next steps\n\nTo address the challenges of building a follow-on framework, we now look at the lessons learned from previous arms control negotiations and identify strategies the United States might follow to eventually achieve a successful outcome.\n\nClarify national security interests and identify corresponding arms control tools\n\nIt is common wisdom that arms control is not an end in itself, but is instead a means to ensure national security. In this view, any future arms control negotiations need to be preceded by a thorough reevaluation of the national security interests they are meant to achieve. During the Cold War, arms control worked in tandem with deterrence and other elements of national power to manage strategic competition. When the Cold War ended, the role of arms control changed to a collaborative tool to manage, first, a controlled drawdown of excess strategic forces, then, deep cuts of nuclear forces, and eventually, elimination. With the pendulum swinging back to strategic competition, arms control may once again have to serve principally as a tool to manage strategic competition. It is therefore important to address expectations about what arms control can tangibly achieve in the coming years.\n\nAs noted above, US officials and leading nuclear scholars have repeatedly listed the following as problems that arms control should address: the loss of transparency with Russia, Chinas buildup, new weapons, risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation, and the deterioration of international norms. This section explores how the United States should prioritize these issues given the return to strategic competition, and which arms control tools it should rely on for each.\n\nFirst, with the war in Ukraine and the generally growing risk of regional conflicts involving China or Russia, the United States most pressing interest should be to minimize the risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation. The United States time would likely not be wasted here as ensuring \"nonevents\" constitutes \"a strong mutual interest among the United States, Russia, and China\" (Talmadge 2022). Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021). Given Putins escalatory language regarding Ukraine, these measureswhich luckily do not require a formal treatycannot wait any further. In the short term, they would complement New START. In the intermediate term, they would provide some limited, but much-needed confidence should there be no immediate follow-on treaty. In the longer term, risk reduction efforts may \"create opportunities for the parties to address and resolve those security concerns that are blocking the path to nuclear disarmament\" (Woolf 2021).\n\nSecond, the United States should prioritize preventing the loss of transparency regarding Russian strategic nuclear weapons as these continue to comprise most nuclear weapons that can reach the US homeland. In the medium-term, these are still owned by Russia, not China. New STARTs verification and monitoring regime continues to be a highly suitable tool in this regard, because it allows the United States to track the numbers, types, sizes, locations, readiness, and movements of these weapons. This information helps avoid misunderstandings and worst-case planning assumptions that would otherwise fuel a new arms race. It would therefore be in the United States best interest to continue a similar mutual verification and monitoring regime of offensive strategic nuclear forces. For non-strategic nuclear weapons, data declarations would likely be the most suitable transparency tool to address the United States concerns for now. Issues surrounding intrusiveness and feasibility make a fully verifiable framework for these weapons rather difficult absent the necessary political will.\n\nThird, given the US bipartisan concern with Russian treaty violations and the resulting deterioration of international norms, it is within US interest to revitalize the latter. The value of any future arms control treaty or agreement diminishes if it becomes common practice to simply violate them or exit them on a whim. Therefore, to ensure that arms control negotiations are worth the effort and that their value does not disappear overnight, it will be essential to revive international norms surrounding nonproliferation. This could be achieved through bilateral and multilateral normative statements, use of doctrine and strategy dialogues, as well as various tools to increase exit costsincluding treaty provisions and allied, or ideally multilateral, commitments to sanction noncompliant parties.\n\nFinally, how do the traditional tools of arms controllimitations and reductionshold up today? Deep numerical reductions are unlikely without Russian and Chinese participation, given the level of prior reductions, expectations of cheating, and especially the new geopolitical order with Chinas growing military power and nuclear arsenal. However, all three countries need to do their best to overcome these forces as soon as possible and fulfill their disarmament obligations under the NPT. Regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons thatunlike strategic weaponsdo not pose a direct threat to each countrys homeland, reductions would not solve the most pressing concern: escalation through first use in a regional, conventional conflict (such as in Ukraine). Any remaining nuclear warheads could still be used first and risk escalation. For this reason, it is important to realize that reductions themselves should be a longer-term interest, and need to be complemented by other arms control tools such as the ones mentioned earlier. More immediate concerns regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons would be better addressed through risk reduction tools, transparency measures, and the strengthening of international norms.\n\nDespite the limitations of traditional arms control tools, however, the United States (and Russia) would continue to benefit from the force predictability if limits on launchers and warheads remained. Opponents of arms control have for a long time tried to argue that these limits lead to decreased deterrence because it makes the United States reduce its nuclear forces while Russia keeps proportionally investing more into modernizing theirs (Trachtenberg 2021, 7). But changes in deterrence are largely the result of countries having different military doctrines rather than the treaties provisions. For instance, Russia relies more on its nuclear arsenal given its conventional forces inferiority. Today, given the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear triad and its higher number of strategic launchers and larger inventory of strategic nuclear warheads, the United States should feel confident that its deterrent will be preserved in respect to Russia under continued limits on launchers and warheads.\n\nThe key challenge is how Chinas growing nuclear arsenal will affect these numerical and qualitative assessments of the US-Russian balance. Is the credibility of the US nuclear deterrent reduced because of Chinas buildup? Will it undermine the US-Russian balance? If the United States increases its nuclear arsenal, will that cause either Russia or China to increase theirs even more? \"The challenge will then be to redress Russias and Chinas worst-case assessments that the capabilities the United States deploys to deter both countries could or would be used to defeat either one of them. If new approaches to arms control cannot be invented, the world is likely to see worsening security dilemmas, arms racing, and instability\" (Dalton et al. 2022, 13).\n\nBeyond that, future negotiators will likely want to focus on issues other than simple numerical reductions of launchers and warheads, such as the asymmetry in the nuclear production complexesthe roots of the nuclear warhead tree (Albertson 2022, 66). China, concerned about the survivability of its nuclear forces, may be reluctant to agree to fissile material production cut-offs. Because these concerns are partially driven by US missile defenses, it might, however, be open to combining this issue with a moratorium on the deployment of space-based missile defenses, the most plausible means for the United States to undermine Chinas nuclear deterrent (Acton, MacDonald, and Vaddi 2021, 5152).\n\nBuild arms control expertise\n\nTo have any chance at preventing the loss of strategic arms controls benefits and develop remedies to safeguard strategic stability, the US government will need to make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise.\n\nOne important factor that contributed to the arms control achievements in the mid-1980s to 1990s was the amount of expertise in the executive and legislative branches. Those who lived through the Cold War were naturally more concerned with, and educated on, nuclear weapons issues. Moreover, Congress still took its role in foreign policy seriously, and the Senate engaged in arms control through the bipartisan Arms Control Observer Group. For instance, Senate members of this group were tasked to consult with and advise US arms control negotiating teams, and \"to monitor and report to the Senate on the progress and development of negotiations\" (Roth 2014).\n\nToday, however, most of these arms control experts in the executive branch and Senate have retired or in other ways moved on. Current staff has not been able to benefit from the direct experience and on-the-job training of the negotiating, ratification, implementation, and verification processes. The New START Treaty negotiations were the last to benefit from the contributions of the remaining experts and champions from this era (Albertson 2021, 78). The Senate, while still somewhat engaged in the New START negotiations through the National Security Working Group, has largely lost the expertise from the days of the more-engaged Senate Arms Control Observer Groupdue to increased partisanship, diminished prestige, and the GOPs growing skepticism of legally binding international commitments (Roth 2014).\n\nTo regain the interest and expertise needed to think through todays arms control issues, the US government should (1) make significant staffing, training, and retention investments; and (2) increase cooperation and exchange between Congress and the executive branch again. The latter could be achieved possibly through a revitalized congressionally-appointed liaison group as former Sen. Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz previously proposed (Nunn and Moniz 2017).\n\nAlthough much of the deep technical expertise needed to develop effective arms control tools will require access to classified information, these efforts can, to some degree, be pursued in concert with civil society. External funding provided by foundations and philanthropic organizations has traditionally played an instrumental role in hiring, training, and empowering future generations of arms control experts. Many of these experts typically rotate through government at some point during their careers, and they rely on their external networks to both brainstorm new arms control ideas and build support for them in the public discourse. To that end, increased funding for civil society could play a pivotal role in fostering the deep bench of political and technical experts needed to pursue successful arms control negotiations in the future.\n\nDemonstrate Presidential leadership\n\nIt is likely that the chances of any follow-up agreement will be closely related to the degree of presidential lea-dership, support, and involvement in the negotiations, even if such an agreement is ratified in Congress and is not an executive agreement. It is essential to articulate national security objectives at the highest level as soon as possible in the process. If leaders are engaged throughout, the rest of the government will set it as a priority (Gottemoeller 2021, 172).\n\nRose Gottemoeller, the US lead negotiator of New START, assesses that the greatest asset to the treatys negotiations was the willingness of both US President Barack Obama and Russia President Dmitry Medvedev to engageand to use their knowledge about treaty issues. The opening of the New START formal negotiations can arguably be attributed to a US-Russian presidential joint statement that laid out the subject and scope of the new agreement. Two months after the first round of meetings, another presidential joint understanding that contained limit ranges likely enabled the negotiators to operate at a relatively quick pace.\n\nMoreover, there was great and important progress when President Obama and President Medvedev agreed on final warhead and delivery vehicle limits during a side meeting at the 2009 Climate Summit in Copenhagen (Gottemoeller 2021, 46, 89, 91). Throughout these and other arms control negotiations, Russian negotiators have in the past been more likely to consider concrete proposals when they came from a presidential level.\n\nFinally, given the Russians skills at slow-rolling, both presidents agreeing on the same timeline was vital to the relatively timely success of the New START negotiations.\n\nPresidential backing, first, ignited the talks and, second, saved much time by allowing the negotiators to focus on the agreed-upon scope. In the context of a future follow-on agreement, it could be possible to negotiate a technical framework using interagency guidance before any public summit if the political environment is too challenging. It is clear that presidential leadership throughout the New START negotiations provided the delegations on both sides with the needed bureaucratic firepower to get things done quickly, and helped move negotiations along when they were seemingly stuck.\n\nUnderstand the other side: Russia\n\nOn the Russian side, it is critical to understand the role that nuclear weapons play in their politics, military strategy, andperhaps most importantlyits perception of itself as a nation (Williams 2016). Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, describes well the crucial role of such an understanding in a report describing his unprecedented visits to Russias nuclear complex in 1992:\n\n\"We quickly discovered that the Russian view of its nuclear enterprise could not have been more radically different than the prevailing American view. Our Russian colleagues and the nuclear ministry viewed their nuclear weapons and nuclear complex as the crowning achievement of Soviet times and essential to Russias political, scientific, and economic future. With Russias conventional forces having atrophied, nuclear weapons were viewed as their guarantor of sovereignty, assuring Moscow a seat at the international table. Nuclear materials were seen as an economic resource and a national treasure. Nuclear experts and their scientific institutions were seen as an engine for the recovery of the national economy\" (Hecker 2017, 6).\n\nIn the 30 years since these visits, Russias view of its nuclear enterprise has not changed much, particularly considering the poor performance of its conventional forces in conflicts, epitomized by its current war against Ukraine. But perhaps surprisingly, this imbalance may be a boon for arms control given that Russia has typically viewed its participation in such negotiations as evidence of its \"great power\" status. Additionally, Russia may view a renewed arms control agreement as a pathway toward renegotiating the global geopolitical order on its own terms. As a result, Russia is likely to view arms control in a relatively positive light compared to other nuclear-armed states like China.\n\nAlthough Russia is likely to be relatively amenable to the prospect of nuclear negotiations (as suggested by their quick extension of New START in 2021), they, like the United States, will not enter into agreements unless these serve their national security interests. Several key Russian security concerns may need to be addressed to ensure a successful follow-on agreement.\n\nChief among these concerns is the development of advanced US missile defenses. Russia has long regarded the limitation of anti-ballistic missiles as the \"cornerstone of strategic stability,\" and has often explicitly characterized missile defense limits as a precondition to strategic arms control. In 2000, President Vladimir Putin noted that \"the mutual reduction of strategic attack weapons . . . is possible only when the ABM Treaty continues to hold\" (Woolf 2002). Additionally, throughout the New START negotiations, Russian negotiators attempted on several occasions to bring the issue of missile defense to the tableparticularly following pressure from Putin, for whom missile defense was a priority issue (Gottemoeller 2021, 97).\n\nGiven the advancements in US defensive capabilities and Putin being back in the presidential seat today, it is likely that Russia will continue pressing the issue of US missile defenses. As Russia has historically been highly effective at drawing out negotiations, they may initially insist again on US concessions in this areabut they should hopefully recognize that it would not be worth jeopardizing strategic offensive arms control over the issue.\n\nIf Russia refuses to yield, however, the United States could again offer to place some limits on its missile defenses as part of a negotiation. At present, the US missile defense architecture appears to be an ever-evolving, open-ended projectrather than a clearly-defined effort to reach specific deterrence objectives. This has been recently underscored by increasingly blurred lines between theater and homeland defenses, as well as President Trumps assertion that US missile defense will continue to evolve to \"detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace\" (Sonne 2019). These factors likely validate the concerns of Russian strategists who largely never believed previous US assurances about the limited nature of their defenses (Woolf 2002).\n\nTo that end, the United States could consider establishing clear goals and limitations for its missile defense architecture, clearly communicate them to Russia, and then assess which constraints would be acceptable to unblock the path toward strategic arms control. Such constraints would not necessarily have to affect existing US capabilities but could involve placing a cap on interceptors at a higher level than what is currently deployed (Arbatov 2021). Given Chinas similar concerns about US defenses, such actions could potentially also help bring China to the negotiating table.\n\nFinally, regarding one of the United States core concernsnonstrategic nuclear weaponsRussia has so far repeatedly posed preconditions to even begin talks that have been perceived as a pretext to avoid negotiations: the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and the elimination of NATOs nuclear-sharing arrangements and related infrastructure. While the Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons posture has been transitioning to a combination of assets in support of specific missions, the Russian military, political leadership, and elites still believe that Russia needs a larger non-strategic nuclear weapons force than does NATO. This is primarily because Russia sees its non-strategic nuclear weapons to some extent as compensation for the larger US strategic nuclear arsenal.\n\nBecause Russia is unlikely to agree to equal ceiling and intrusive verification measures, a phased approach starting with transparency measures would be more promising. However, Russia might be susceptible to an effort to put its 2020 political commitment to freeze its nuclear stockpile back on the table (Pomper et al. 2022, 4647). In the longer term, to overcome Russias perceived need to compensate for having less strategic nuclear weapons, actual reductions might need to wait for future negotiations including the United Kingdom, France, and China (against whom Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons could be used in a strategic way).\n\nUnderstand the other side: China\n\nThe Chinese side is more difficult to understand. First, China has never engaged in nuclear arms control talks with the United Statesunlike Russia, with which the United States has half a century of experience. Second, while China formally maintains a no-first-use policy, doctrinal debates are still ongoing about the limits of this policy (Leveringhaus 2022). To make matters worse, the security concerns related to the two countrys growing competition have restricted opportunities for US-Chinese academic exchanges that would allow the United States to better understand Chinas goals and doctrine (Zhao 2021).\n\nWhat seems clear, however, is that it would be almost impossible to include China in an immediate follow-on treaty to New START. First, the remaining time until February 2026 is not enough to include an entirely new negotiating partner with whom no such negotiating history or relations exist. Notably, it took the United States and Russia decades to get to their first verifiable arms control treaty. Second, Chinese officials have explicitly and repeatedly rejected joining arms limitation talks and previously suggested that they will join such negotiations only after the \"huge gap\" between their arsenal and the US and Russian nuclear arsenals has been closed. Until then, however, they have signaled that they stand ready to discuss \"all issues related to strategic stability and nuclear risk reduction in the framework of P5, [the UN Security Councils five permanent members, including] China, Russia, US, UK, and France\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peoples Republic of China 2020).\n\nChina likely perceives time to be on its side and is probably waiting until it gains the needed leverage to become a more equal negotiating partner in this area. The projected increase in the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenalperhaps with up to 1,000 warheads by 2030 (US Department of Defense 2021, 90) and potentially as many ICBMs as each of the United States and Russiacould potentially create new opportunities for arms control discussions around the end of this decade. But, even then, China is unlikely to agree to strategic arms control limits until it feels confident enough in its nuclear forces continued survivability. Moreover, China has traditionally relied on secrecy and opacity to help safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal (Riqiang 2016). It would have to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime like the New START treaty.\n\nMeanwhile, to make any progress, the United States should continue to explore the following questions: What are the lessons from previous nuclear dialogues with China that may form the basis for future joint efforts? A previous track 1.5 dialogue (a term of art to describe situations in which both official and non-official actors cooperate) with China clarified that China, seeking recognition for its prominent role in the new international order, is interested in discussing a \"new paradigm of strategic stabilityone not built around deterrent threats, especially nuclear blackmailbut broader ideals of cooperation and mutual respect \" (Santoro and Gromoll 2020, 11). The United States needs to therefore think about possible ways to make China feel this interest is being addressed while preserving its national security priorities.\n\nMoreover, Chinas strategic stability concerns all center around the fear that the United States might be after \"absolute security,\" looking to overcome mutual vulnerability. Therefore, the current and future US administrations should consider tools to build confidence in this area with China. Even if informal and on a track 1.5 basis, these could eventually lay the groundwork for a first treaty with China.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for cooperation with China, the United States should also explore the following questions: Is there any room for the United States and China to slowly start exchanging certain types of information about each others strategic nuclear forces, in particular those types about which China might not feel as protective? What would the United States be prepared to offer China in exchange for limits on Chinese nuclear forces? Is a more creative French-style approach to negotiations neededthat offers to combine unrelated issues, which in Chinas case would include tariffs, special economic zones, and other economic issues? How can the United States best leverage the P5 forum for risk reduction with China?\n\nMake long-term investments\n\nBecause of the difficulty of achieving the United States current objectives, especially the inclusion of China, in a follow-on treaty, it is advisable to develop and pursue a long-term strategy for achieving these goals. Given the current geopolitical context, a treaty covering Chinese strategic nuclear forces might not happen until the 2030s when China feels secure enough in its nuclear deterrent capability and negotiation leverage.\n\nTo be ready once the other side agrees to talk, the United States should start making the following long-term investments. First, it should develop its positions on priority demands and possible concessions it would be willing to make in negotiations with both Russia and China. Second, it should explore all possibilities for the national laboratories to engage in technical verification exchanges and preparations with both Russia and China to ensure technical details will be ready once circumstances are ripe for new treaties and agreements. Additionally, to increase cooperation with China that may lead to more cooperation in the area, the United States may consider offering early warning training to China which is intensively developing its early warning capability. Something similar was considered for Russia during the Cold War and would have the added benefit of reducing miscalculation risks. Finally, the United States should view even unfruitful negotiations as a means to build and maintain arms control negotiation expertiseas well as to uphold communication channelsuntil a treaty can be successfully negotiated and concluded.\n\nGet the militarys support\n\nHaving the militarys support is key to both negotiations and ratification. First, the US Department of Defense is one of the most important US interagency stakeholders, and the interagencys support has proven crucial during negotiations. During the New START negotiations, Gottemoeller assesses the strong Pentagon support to be one of the core factors in the negotiations success (Gottemoeller 2021, 96). Getting the two top military leaders together helped overcome institutional resistance in each military bureaucracy (Gottemoeller 2021, 70). US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen and Russian Gen. Makarov, by simply agreeing on the main issues and their priority, gave the Russian delegations military members a high-level boost within the Russian Ministry of Defense for working the details (Gottemoeller 2021, 74).\n\nSecond, the militarys support increases the chances of ratification. Many senators simply do not wish to be on the record for voting against the military.\n\nThe militarys support is best achieved primarily by listening to and addressing its concerns. In the New START negotiations, for instance, the US military services were worried about the costs of elimination procedures and the operational interruptions due to inspections (Gottemoeller 2021, 63). The negotiators focus and dedication toward this issue helped ensure their support. Moreover, involving the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as much as possible throughout the negotiations can be key in this effort too as it will make the military feel like it partially owned the process.\n\nFuture arms control will have to solve several problems for the US military. First, old problems that are likely to resurface without a follow-on to the New START Treaty should not be discounted. These concern primarily the lack of constraints on Russian nuclear forces which would incentivize a new arms race and the costs of the additionally-needed intelligence collection and analysis in the absence of a verification mechanism. In fact, after the New START Treatys executive extension in 2021, US Gen Hyten, who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to 2021, expressed his and other Department of Defense officials support of the treaty especially because of its nuclear weapons limits and verification process (Vergun 2021).\n\nAdditionally, the amount of military backing is likely to increase with the number of new problems the negotiations manage to address. Gen. Hyten is one of many Department of Defense officials to reiterate that new Russian weapons and Chinas buildup are increasingly posing strategic problems for the US military (Vergun 2021). Addressing these issues in some form or another through future arms control approaches would likely help this US administration, or the next, get the necessary military support. Moreover, maintaining deterrence through a strong nuclear triad has historically been a strong military interestalthough there is reasonable debate on what is needed in this regard. Overall, it is advisable to frame any future arms control approaches within a framework that seeksand getsthe militarys support.\n\nGain bipartisan support\n\nTo be sustainable, a follow-on agreement would need broad bipartisan support to remain insulated from politicization. This is particularly critical given the likelihood of political fluctuation in the House, Senate, and presidency over the coming years. New STARTs survival throughout the Trump administrations pattern of treaty withdrawals can be partially attributed to continued bipartisan support within Congressincluding from senators who initially voted in favor of the treaty in 2010 and remained in Congress throughout that tumultuous period.\n\nTo that end, a follow-on agreement must address the concerns of both major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans. Chief among these are concerns over breakout potential and verification.\n\nOne prominent critique of New START is that it could incentivize warhead uploading in a crisis because both parties are permitted to retain an unlimited number of non-deployed strategic warheads (Smith 2020). As discussed earlier, both countries do indeed have a significant upload capacity and could more than double their number of deployed warheads if necessary. However, a potential breakout scenario is likely to be more of a Russian concern than a US one: given that the United States has a larger number of empty launch spots on its missiles than Russia does, the United States has a significantly larger upload capacity. As a result, a potential breakout capacity should be more of a fear for Russia than for the United States, making the prospect of a Russian breakout unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, even though a significant upload would accelerate the arms race, it may not necessarily affect strategic stability between the United States and Russia. In 2012, a joint report by the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to Congress noted that: \"The Russian Federation . . . would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty, primarily because of the inherent survivability of the planned US strategic force structure, particularly the OHIO-class ballistic missile submarines, a number of which are at sea at any given time\" (US Department of Defense 2012). This argument could potentially be used in the future to mitigate fears among US policy makers of a future breakout scenario.\n\nAnother critique of New START centers around the treatys verification regimespecifically, that a limited number of on-site inspections may not be enough to verify compliance with the treatys central limits on deployed warheads. As explained by Bryan Smith, a senior fellow at the George Mason Universitys National Security Institute:\n\n\"[E]ven if a US inspection revealed that a particular missile was loaded with a number larger than Russia had declared, there is no logical way to infer from thisor any such discrepancythat the entire force had exceeded the 1,550 warhead limit. Conversely, neither could we logically conclude that the entire force complied with the 1,550 limit, even if the 20-30 percent lifetime sample inspections all confirmed that the observed warhead loadings matched their declarations.\" (Smith 2020)\n\nGiven Russias pattern of violating arms control agreements, such concerns should be taken seriously. Yet, perfect verificationthat is, accurate and exhaustiveis not necessary for the success of an agreement. Rather, the United States should be satisfied with ensuring Paul Nitzes definition of effective verification that \"if the other side moves beyond the limits of the treaty in any militarily significant way, we would be able to detect such violations in time to respond effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of the violation\" (Nitze 1988).\n\nIt is therefore possible for the United States to achieve effective verification of a treaty through limited on-site inspections. Ivan Oelrich, a former vice president of the Federation of American Scientists, comprehensively addressed the prospect of Russian cheating in 2010:\n\n\"Say the Russians wanted to cheat by putting more warheads than allowed on, say, 10% of their missiles. [. . .] They would have to put the warheads on missiles and then lie on the data exchange and hope they dont get caught. So, if we pick our inspection sites randomly, then there is a 10% chance they will get caught in one inspection and a 90% chance they will get away without detection on that one inspection. But there is only an 81% chance of getting past two inspections, 73% chance away with three, and so on. If we do 10 inspections, there is a 2/3 chance we will catch a violation of only a 10% cheat, hardly odds that would appeal to a prospective cheater. There is a 90% chance we would catch a 20% cheat. Just in the first 10 inspections. Remember that inspections continue over the years and our confidence will increase over time, approaching near certainty that even small violations will be detected by the time the warhead limits are reached\" (Oelrich 2010).\n\nAs a result, to alleviate these broader political concerns over verification, the United States should aim to incorporate a sufficient number of on-site inspections into any follow-on agreement. A rough calculation to determine an acceptable number of inspections can be derived, as done above, by estimating the percentage of missiles where Russia will try to cheat and selecting a confidence percentage of acceptable risk. The formula is expressed as follows: 1-x = yz, where x is the desired confidence percentage, y is the likelihood of not catch- ing a cheating Russia during each independent inspection, and z is the number of necessary inspections.\n\nFor example, if the United States suspects that Russia could try to cheat with 10 percent of its missiles, then it will need at least 21 inspections to achieve a 90 percent confidence rating that Russia is not cheating at that rate. It would need at least 28 inspections to achieve a 95 percent confidence rating, and at least 229 inspections to achieve a 99 percent confidence rating. The desired confidence rating, coupled with an educated assessment of Russias capability and intent to cheat, will help determine how many on-site inspections would be sufficient to verify an agreement. However, these will need to again be carefully weighed with the militarys operational costs and sensitivity concerns. Due to the US Senates concerns about Russian cheating and the return to great power competition since New STARTs negotiations, the right balance might end up requiring a higher confidence rating today.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon put in proportional efforts to overcome the political forces stalling meaningful dialogue, February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals.\n\nRussia and the United States would lose mutual predictability, and military planners would have to consider an increased worst-case scenario, starting with the possible upload of nearly doubleor possibly more, in the case of the United Statesthe total number of warheads on strategic delivery vehicles. Both sides would inevitably accelerate defense spending, resulting in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nTo preserve bilateral arms control in these times of strategic competition, the United States and Russia should consider and prepare for several options, with trade-offs between feasibility and ambition: continued adherence through mutual moratoria the negotiation of a new executive agreement, and the conclusion of an entirely new treaty. The first two options have the benefit of not requiring legislative approval. However, their value would depend on the amount of political will on both sides to legally enable continued verification and refrain from cheating or exiting the agreement. At the same time, the United States and Russia need to carefully examine and prioritize their underlying interests for the option of a follow-on treaty. Even if a follow-on treaty fails to be ready by February 2026, strategic arms control treaty history has demonstrated that there are reasonable options for bridging treaty-less periods.\n\nThe history of treaty negotiations informs the next steps for the US government: (1) re-evaluate the full box of arms control tools in the light of strategic competition, (2) make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise, (3) understand Russian and Chinese strategic priorities, (4) ensure readiness to negotiate once Russia and eventually China agree to talk, (5) get the militarys support, (6) ensure presidential leadership, and (7) gain bipartisan support. The best practices for each of these steps should help guide the next generation of arms control champions and ensure that the United States, Russia, and China can temper the most dangerous impulses of geopolitical competition and pursue their mutual security priorities through strategic arms control.\n\n(Editors note: The text on pages 354 and 355 of the PDF version of this articlestarting from one paragraph above the subheading \"Plan B: pursuing and executive agreement\" and ending at the subheading \"Plan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\"has been corrected for issues of fact.)",

General Assembly scheduled a vote for Monday on a resolution that would call for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including by paying reparations.\n\nThe draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would recognize the need to establish \"an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury\" arising from Russias \"wrongful acts\" against Ukraine.\n\nIt would recommend that the assemblys 193 member nations, in cooperation with Ukraine, create \"an international register\" to document claims and information on damage, loss or injury to Ukrainians and the government caused by Russia.\n\nRussias veto power in the 15-member Security Council has blocked the U.N.s most powerful body from taking any action since President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. But there are no vetoes in the General Assembly, which already has adopted four resolutions criticizing Russias invasion.\n\n3:18 p.m.:\n\n2:30 p.m.: Cambodia's leader met Ukraine's foreign minister on Wednesday in Phnom Penh, with Prime Minister Hun Sen saying his country \"opposes aggression\" days ahead of a regional summit that Russia's foreign minister is due to attend, Reuters reported.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is due to sign a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a senior Cambodian official said, as Kyiv seeks to strengthen ties with the bloc, which joined international condemnation of Russia's invasion.\n\nIn a statement on his Facebook page, Hun Sen said Cambodia \"opposes aggression, threats or the use of violence against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent states.\"\n\n2:15 p.m.:\n\n2 p.m.: India will expand economic ties with Russia and continue to buy oil from Moscow, India's foreign minister said, pointing out that imports of discounted crude from Moscow have worked to its advantage, VOAs Anjana Pasricha reported.\n\nForeign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said during a visit to Moscow that as the world's third-largest consumer of oil, it is \"our fundamental obligation\" to ensure that Indian consumers have the \"best possible access on the most advantageous terms to international markets.\"\n\nHe made his comments after a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday.\n\nIn his first visit to Russia since the Ukrainian conflict erupted, the Indian minister reaffirmed New Delhi's longstanding ties with Moscow calling it an \"exceptionally steady\" and \"time-tested relationship.\"\n\n1:50 p.m.: Paratroopers with Ukraine's 79th Air Assault Brigade say they're holding positions around the small city of Maryinka in eastern Ukraine despite daily Russian attacks. They say Russia has deployed members of the Vagner private mercenary group, special forces, and recently mobilized infantry against them. Holding Maryinka is seen as critical to Ukrainian hopes of retaking the regional capital, Donetsk. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n1:40 p.m.: Russia's leading war hawks on Wednesday swiftly rallied behind the decision to abandon the Ukrainian city of Kherson, putting a brave face on one of Moscow's most humiliating retreats in nearly nine months of war, Reuters reported.\n\nThe pullout proposed by General Sergei Surovikin, appointed last month to take overall charge of Russia's war effort, means Moscow is giving up a strategic city just north of annexed Crimea, the only Ukrainian provincial capital it had captured since its February 24 invasion.\n\nThe decision - described by one Russian military blogger as \"a black page in the history of the Russian army\" - was nonetheless quickly defended by some of the most high-profile proponents of the war as a wise and necessary action.\n\n\"After weighing all the pros and cons, General Surovikin made the difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers,\" said Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader who has frequently urged a more aggressive approach to the war and has even called for the use of low-grade nuclear weapons.\n\n1:35 p.m.:\n\n1:20 p.m.: Russias military announced Wednesday that its withdrawing from Kherson, but Ukrainian authorities cautioned against considering the retreat a done deal. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that the Russians were feigning a pullout from Kherson to lure the Ukrainian army into an entrenched battle in the strategic industrial port city, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRecapturing Kherson could allow Ukraine to win back lost territory in the Zaporizhzhia region and other southern areas, leading to an eventual push back into Crimea, which Russia illegally seized in 2014. A Russian retreat is almost certain to raise domestic pressure on the Kremlin to escalate the conflict.\n\nBut Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter: \"Actions speak louder than words. We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight.\"\n\nYaroslav Yanushevych, Khersons Ukrainian-appointed governor, called on residents \"not to give in to euphoria\" just yet. Another Ukrainian-appointed Kherson regional official, Serhii Khlan, told reporters that Russian forces had blown up five bridges to slow the advance of Kyivs forces.\n\nAs the reports of a Russian withdrawal emerged, Zelenskyy met with his senior military staff in Kyiv to discuss the situation, including attempts to recapture territory, his website reported without giving details.\n\nIn addition to the largely successful counteroffensive, Ukrainian resistance fighters behind the front line have worked inside Kherson, with acts of sabotage and assassinations of Moscow-appointed officials.\n\n1:05 p.m.:\n\n12:50 p.m.: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday it was \"encouraging\" to see Ukrainian forces being able to liberate more of the country's territory, after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered his troops to withdraw from Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking in London where he was meeting British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Stoltenberg said: \"It is encouraging to see how the brave Ukrainian forces are able to liberate more Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"The victories, the gains the Ukrainian armed forces are making belong to the brave, courageous Ukrainian soldiers but of course the support they receive from the United Kingdom, from NATO allies and partners is also essential,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Sunak, a Downing Street spokesperson said the pair had emphasized the importance of continuing to support Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n12:35 p.m.:\n\n12:20 p.m.: Britain is stepping up its support for Ukrainian soldiers through the winter as a key battle in Kherson looms and as mobilized Russian troops struggle, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Reuters on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\nWallace joined NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to observe the training of Ukrainian troops in the southeast English town of Lydd, as Britain announced the delivery of a further 12,000 extreme cold-weather sleeping kits for Ukraine.\n\n\"Winter is approaching and that is an important challenge for both sides,\" he said. \"So we're determined ... to give Ukrainian soldiers the best basic skills because we already know that the Russian military aren't doing that.\"\n\nUkrainian forces have piled pressure on Russian troops in the southern region of Kherson that Moscow occupied in February - the only place where Russia has a presence on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\n12:05 p.m.: The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in an interview with CNN that it will be critical to help Ukrainian civilians stay warm and safe as the winter looms.\n\n11:55 a.m.: The European Union's executive arm on Wednesday proposed a support package for war-gripped Ukraine worth up to 18 billion euros ($18.06 billion) in 2023, but Hungary said it would not contribute to the joint assistance, which would come as highly concessional loans, Reuters reported.\n\n\"This shows true solidarity of the EU,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted after the European Commission unveiled its plan. \"Together we resist Russia's aggression, together we'll rebuild Ukraine, together we'll be in the EU.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal faced resistance from Hungary, which has dragged its feet on EU sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, even before the Commission's announcement.\n\n\"I have made it clear that Hungary is ready to support Ukraine, but we do not wish to contribute to any new loan to be taken up by the EU,\" Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n11:45 a.m.:\n\n11:40 a.m.: A senior adviser to Ukraine's president said on Wednesday it was too early to talk about a Russian troop pullout from the southern city of Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday ordered his troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the face of Ukrainian attacks near the southern city of Kherson.\n\n\"It's necessary to separate words from deeds,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a statement to Reuters. \"Until the Ukrainian flag is flying over Kherson, it makes no sense to talk about a Russian withdrawal.\"\n\nHe said that Russian forces remained in Kherson, which was captured by Russian troops shortly after Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine but had become the focus of a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n\"Ukraine does not take these statements (by Russia) into consideration,\" he said. \"It is still too early to talk about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson: a grouping of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is being maintained in the city, and additional manpower is being pulled into the region.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our armed forces work according to their plan: reconnaissance, risk assessment, effective counterattack.\"\n\n11:25 a.m.: Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted a message Wednesday reacting to television reports that Russias military has ordered its troops to withdraw from the southern city of Kherson.\n\n10:55 a.m.: Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday ordered his troops to withdraw from the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson and take up defensive lines on the opposite bank of the River Dnipro, Reuters reported.\n\nThe announcement marked one of Russia's most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war, now nearing the end of its ninth month.\n\nIn televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, said it was no longer possible to keep Kherson city supplied.\n\n\"We will save the lives of our soldiers and fighting capacity of our units. Keeping them on the right (western) bank is futile. Some of them can be used on other fronts,\" Surovikin said.\n\nThe news followed weeks of Ukrainian advances towards the city and a race by Russia to relocate tens of thousands of its residents.\n\nShoigu responded: \"I agree with your conclusions and proposals. Proceed with the withdrawal of troops and take all measures to transfer forces across the river.\"\n\nThe announcement had been anticipated by Russia's influential war bloggers, who described it as a bitter blow.\n\n10:45 a.m.:\n\n10:20 a.m.: Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, died on Wednesday in a car crash, Russian state news agencies reported, according to Reuters.\n\nStremousov was one of the most prominent public faces of the Russian occupation of Ukraine, using social media to pump out aggressive statements, of which the latest appeared on Wednesday morning.\n\nTASS news agency said the press service for the head of the region had confirmed his death. The exact circumstances were unclear.\n\n9:50 a.m.: The U.S. midterm elections could have a significant impact on Ukraine, where U.S. support is invaluable in the war effort. VOAs Myroslava Gongadze has more from Ukrainian citizens and experts on the U.S. vote.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Russia has launched multiple suicide drones on Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, wounding people and damaging civilian facilities, the head of the regional military administration said, as fierce battles are under way in the eastern Donetsk region and in the south, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\"The occupiers attacked the area massively with kamikaze drones. Our air defense destroyed five barrage ammunition. They also attacked the city of Dnipro with drones, targeting a logistics enterprise. Four employees were wounded; three of them are in serious condition in the hospital,\" Governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nRussian forces also bombarded the Nikopol district in the region with Grad missiles and heavy artillery. Reznichenko said the shelling damaged private houses, a factory, and a power line, but no one was injured.\n\nA fire spread over more than 3,000 square meters but was extinguished, Reznichenko said.\n\nRussian troops regularly shell the Dnipropetrovsk region with various types of weapons, in particular the Nikopol, Kryvorizky, and Synelnyk districts.\n\n9:15 a.m.:\n\n9:05 a.m.: Russia said on Wednesday it still saw no progress on easing its exports of fertilizers and grain - parts of the Black Sea grain deal that Moscow views as fundamental to extending the initiative beyond next week, Reuters reported.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters the United States and European Union were obstructing Russia's exports and said it remained unclear whether Moscow would extend its participation in the initiative, which expires on Nov. 19.\n\n\"The U.S. and the EU continue to put up obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain. We will take this into account when deciding whether to extend the grain deal,\" she said.\n\nRussia agreed to a deal brokered by the United Nations in Turkey in July that allowed Ukraine, a major grain exporter, to resume exports through Black Sea ports that Russian warships had blockaded.\n\n8:45 a.m.:\n\n8:05 a.m.: Switzerland will extend for a year its streamlined process for hosting refugees from the war in Ukraine, the government said on Wednesday, deciding it was not yet safe for people to return home, Reuters reported.\n\nThe cabinet said special protection status for these people would remain in effect until March 2024 barring a fundamental change in the situation in Ukraine. Switzerland's doors opened in March this year, shortly after Russia invaded its neighbor.\n\nSince March more than 67,000 Ukrainians have received refuge in Switzerland. As of Oct. 31, 6,394 people had permanently left Switzerland to return home, the cabinet added in a statement.\n\nEastern European countries are preparing for a possible new wave of Ukrainian refugees

parliament will discuss the ratification of Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO during its autumn session after a series of EU-related bills have been passed, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Finland and Sweden are our allies and they can count on us,\" Gergely Gulyas told a briefing.\n\nHungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not cleared the accession.\n\n\"Our aim is that parliament should ratify their application before the end of this year ... we have always said we supported the ratification,\" Gulyas said, in reply to a question.\n\nOrban's government had submitted the relevant bills in mid-July, but parliament, in which his ruling Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority, has still not tabled the two bills for debate and approval.\n\n6:20 a.m.:\n\n6 a.m.: Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned the use of mercenaries in Russia's war against Ukraine, saying they were inflicting \"so much cruelty\" on the population.\n\nSpeaking at the end of his general audience, he said: \"I renew my call for prayers for the martyred Ukraine, let us ask the Lord for peace for these people who are so troubled and who suffer so much cruelty, so much cruelty by the mercenaries who are making war.\"\n\nThe pope did not specifically mention Russia and he did not elaborate, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, has been accused by the European Union and the United States of mounting clandestine operations on the Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in February.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said the group does not represent the state but that private military contractors have the right to work anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law.\n\n5:42 a.m.: The secretaries of Russia and Iran's Security Councils discussed the situation in Ukraine, security cooperation and measures to combat \"Western interference\" in their domestic affairs at a series of meetings in Tehran on Wednesday, Reuters reported citing Russian state media.\n\nNikolai Patrushev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was in Tehran as Russia and Iran try to forge closer ties amid Western isolation.\n\n4:59 a.m.: Eastbound gas flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Germany to Poland rose on Wednesday as did Russian supplies to Europe via Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\nExit flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German border stood at 6,287,114 kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour between 0600 CET and 0700 CET, versus 2,479,861 kWh/h an hour earlier, from pipeline operator Gascade showed.\n\nNominations for Russian gas into Slovakia from Ukraine via the Velke Kapusany border point rose to 37.4 million cubic meters (mcm), from 36.7 mcm in the previous day, Ukrainian transmission system data showed.\n\nRussian gas producer Gazprom said that it will ship 42.4 million cubic meters of natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, in line with volumes of recent days.\n\nGas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which crosses the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, remained at zero.\n\nThe pipeline was shut on August 31 for what was supposed to be three days of maintenance, but has not reopened, with Moscow blaming the situation on Western sanctions and technical issues.\n\nRussia said it was unable to restart the pipeline but since then the pipeline has also been damaged by suspected sabotage.\n\n4:10 a.m.: NATO leaders will gather for their next summit in Vilnius on July 11-12, the military alliance announced Wednesday.\n\nThe venue will be an opportunity for leaders to \"agree further steps to strengthen our deterrence and defense and review significant increases in defense spending, as

possible wave of Ukrainian refugees as Russia targets power and heating plants ahead of winter, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy saying about 4 million people are already without power.\n\nZelenskiyy said 14 regions plus the capital Kyiv were without power and Ukraine's electrical grid operator Ukrenergo said scheduled hourly power outages would affect the whole of the country on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\nRussian forces have targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure with missiles and drone strikes in the run up to winter, when mean temperatures typically drop to several degrees below zero Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), with lows of minus 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nSome 6.9 million people are believed displaced internally within Ukraine and east European countries such as Slovakia and Hungary are preparing for an influx in coming months.\n\n\"An increase in numbers is being felt and is expected. It is currently up 15%,\" said Roman Dohovic, an aid coordinator for the eastern Slovak city of Kosice.\n\nUkrainian forces have been on the offensive in recent months while Russia is regrouping to defend areas of Ukraine it still occupies, having called up hundreds of thousands of reservists over the past month.\n\n3:05 a.m.: The British defense ministry said Russia is working to repair the Crimean Bridge, and that it is \"unlikely to be fully operational until at least September 2023.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the road was to be closed to install a 64-metre span, the ministry said. Additional three spans are needed to rebuild the damaged road.\n\n\"Although Crimean officials have claimed these additional spans will be in place by 20 December, a briefing provided to President [Vladmir] Putin added that works to the other carriageway would cause disruption to road traffic until March 2023.\"\n\nThe bridge was used to transfer Russian logistics supplies for Crimea and southern Ukraine. Russia used the route to move military equipment and troops in the area by rail or road since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the ministry added.\n\n2:29 a.m.:\n\n2:04 a.m.: A Russian-installed mayor in the town of Snihurivka, east of the southern city of Mykolaiv, was cited by Russia's RIA news agency as saying residents had seen tanks and that fierce fighting was going on, according to Reuters.\n\n\"They got into contact during the day and said there were tanks moving around and, according to their information, heavy fighting on the edge of the town,\" the mayor, Yuri Barabashov, said, referring to the residents.\n\n\"People saw this equipment moving through the streets in the town center,\" he said.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the Kherson region, said on the Telegram messaging service that Ukrainian forces had tried to advance on three fronts, including Snihurivka.\n\nVitaly Kim, the Ukrainian governor of Mykolaiv region, apparently quoting an intercepted conversation between Russian servicemen, suggested that Ukrainian forces had already pushed the Russians out of the area.\n\n\"Russian troops are complaining that they have already been thrown out of there,\" Kim said in a statement on his Telegram channel.\n\nReuters was not able to verify the battlefield reports.\n\nThere was no official word on the situation in the town from military officials in either Ukraine or Russia.\n\n1:45 a.m.:\n\n1:18 a.m.: U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner was transferred last week from a detention center outside the Russian capital and is on her way to a penal colony, Reuters reported Wednesday, quoting her legal team.\n\nThe two-time Olympic gold medalist was arrested on February 17, a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, at a Moscow airport with vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. She was sentenced on August 4 to nine years in a penal colony on charges of possessing and smuggling drugs.\n\nGriner had pleaded guilty but said she had made an \"honest mistake\" and had not meant to break the law.\n\nNeither Griner's exact whereabouts nor her final destination were known, the legal team said in a statement, adding that in line with Russian procedures, her attorneys as well as the U.S. Embassy should be notified upon her arrival at her destination.\n\nThe notification would take up to two weeks to be received.\n\nThe White House said U.S. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to \"prevail on her Russian captors to improve her treatment and the conditions she may be forced to endure in a penal colony.\"\n\nIt did not give any details about Griner's whereabouts.\n\n12:30 a.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his forces would not yield \"a single centimeter\" in battles for the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk while Russian-installed officials said Ukrainian forces were moving into a southern town with tanks, Reuters reported.\n\nThe focal points of the conflict in the industrial region of Donetsk are around the towns of Bakhmut, Soledar and Avdiivka, which have seen the heaviest fighting since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\n\"The activity of the occupiers remains at an extremely high level dozens of attacks every day,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address late on Tuesday. \"They are suffering extraordinarily high losses. But the order remains the same to advance on the administrative boundary of Donetsk region. We will not yield a single centimeter of our land,\" he said.\n\nThe region is one of four Russia said it annexed in September. Fighting had been going on there between Ukrainian military and Russian proxy forces since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea in the south.\n\n12:03 a.m.: Police raided two branches of Swiss bank UBS in Germany in connection with alleged money laundering by a Russian businessman, German officials and media said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.\n\nFrankfurt prosecutor Georg Ungefuk did not identify the suspect by name, but said the raids were connected to an investigation in which officials raided a luxury yacht and two dozen properties in Germany in September.\n\nGerman media cited Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin who is subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions, as the target in that operation.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

The enemy does not give us gifts, does not make 'gestures of goodwill'. We choose all of this.\"\n\nInstead, Zelenskyy explained, Ukraine moves \"very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk,\" both in the interests of liberating the entire territory of Ukraine and minimizing loss of life on and off the battlefield.\n\nThat also means remaining silent on details of upcoming operations, he noted, and letting the victories speak for themselves when they come.\n\n\"This is how we will secure the liberation of Kherson, Kakhovka, Donetsk, and our other cities,\" he said. \"But this will be the result of our efforts, our defense operations.

                "cc_text": "As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly today recommended Member States create an international register of damage to serve as a record of evidence and claims information.\n\nBy the terms of the text, titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" adopted by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions the Assembly recognized that the Russian Federation must be held to account for any violations of international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law in or against Ukraine. The Assembly further recognized the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury arising from the Russian Federations internationally wrongful acts.\n\nThe Assembly also reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine and demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from that countrys territory.\n\nMany delegates expressed their support for the establishment of a registry while others voiced their concern over the resolutions divisiveness and dangerous precedent in allowing the establishment of a mechanism that is not accountable to the Assembly. Several delegations spotlighted the hypocrisy and double standards of the resolutions sponsors.\n\nIntroducing the text (document A/ES-11/L.6), the representative of Ukraine noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he underscored while emphasizing that the resolution is concerned with ensuring an appropriate response that averts any aggressors temptation to start a war. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nAs an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery, the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the Assemblys authority, Guatemalas minister noted.\n\nIt is very straightforward, Albanias speaker explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability.\n\n\"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars,\" Polands speaker stressed.\n\n\"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" the Russian Federations delegate countered, noting that the United Nations would have no role in the establishment of a mechanism created by a group of States which will decide its functioning. The West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery intended to draw out the conflict. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations.\n\nElaborating on the texts flaws, the speaker for China noted that the invoked articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts have no legally binding status as the research products of the International Law Commission. The Assembly is not a judicial body, he stressed, while his colleague from Eritrea agreed on behalf of a group of like-minded countries. Its resolutions cannot go beyond its mandate and responsibilities to serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts, she emphasized. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she added.\n\nWill Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory?, that countrys speaker asked. What about Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine? he continued. Creating a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and well-documented demands is unjust, morally unacceptable and damaging to the Assemblys credibility, he emphasized.\n\nEchoing the concern over the \"message of exceptionalism\", the representative for South Africa pointed out the lack of clarity on the mechanisms composition and eventual legal status.\n\nAlso speaking today were the representatives of Latvia (on behalf of Nordic-Baltic countries), Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Australia, Canada, Slovakia, Italy, Ireland, Syria, Nicaragua, Romania, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, France, Netherlands, Belarus, Iran, the United States and the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nAn observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also spoke.\n\nThe representatives of the Bahamas (on behalf of the Caribbean Community), Mexico, Venezuela, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Pakistan, Kenya, Brunei Darussalam, Argentina, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Bahrain spoke in explanation of vote.\n\nThe Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 15 November, to consider the election of members to the Committee for Programme and Coordination and appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences, the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the Joint Inspection Unit. The Assembly will also take up the related reports of those bodies and the reports of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).\n\nIntroduction of Draft Resolution\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), introducing the draft resolution titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" (document A/ES-11/L.6), noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Today, the Russian Federation is doing everything it can to avoid paying the price for its own war and occupation, he said, before referencing that countrys words and stance on the creation of the United Nations Compensation Commission for any damage, loss or injury arising out of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait. From day one of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has thrown bombs, missiles and shells at Ukrainian cities and villages; destroyed roads, bridges and railways; demolished almost half of Ukraines power grid and utilities; and committed murder, rape, torture, forced deportation and looting. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he said, while urging the Assembly to hold that country accountable. The Russian Federation prefers impunity to accountability and knows only two things lies and veto when it comes to the Security Councils processes, he said.\n\nThe proposed resolution, he noted, calls for Member States to build the legitimate international infrastructure which addresses the consequences of the Russian Federations aggression against his country, records evidence of atrocities and preserves the hope for justice for millions whose lives have been forever changed. It is about an appropriate response which averts the temptation of any aggressor in starting a war, he emphasized. He then reaffirmed his countrys commitment to a transparent, impartial and objective process managed and overseen by the international community and expressed his hope for cooperation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in assessing damages. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nMARIO ADOLFO BCARO FLORES, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala , said that, as a country that in its own history has experienced a lot of conflict, Guatemala acknowledges the importance of peace and respect for human rights. The draft resolution is a step towards reconciliation among the parties. Considering that the text includes civilian claims, it is an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery. As a country that strongly believes in multilateralism, Guatemala is convinced that the Assembly has the mandate and authority to adopt the draft, as set out in Chapter Four of the United Nations Charter. The language of the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the authority of the General Assembly. He called on all Member States to support the initiative, because \"it is the right thing to do\". The Assembly cannot remain paralyzed or inactive.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), offering to correct gaffes in Ukraines statement, called the draft resolution a classic example of a rules-based order in which a narrow group of States attempts to consecrate something that is illegal while also positioning the Assembly as a judicial body, which it is not. \"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" he said, emphasizing that the draft resolution tries to legalize something which, from the point of view of international law, cannot be legalized. Moreover, if adopted, the text will have consequences for the co-sponsors which, like a boomerang, will go back on them. The \"so-called international mechanism\" would be created by a group of States that will decide its functioning and designate the guilty parties and the amount of reparations. The United Nations will play no role in that process, there will be no accountability to the Assembly and most Member States will have no right to any control over the mechanism, he added.\n\nThe Russian Federation has no doubt that the funds for damage compensation will be drawn from frozen, or rather stolen, Russian assets worth billions of dollars, he said, adding that the West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery that is intended to draw out the conflict. This will increase global tensions and instability, but the beneficiaries will be Western military corporations that have already made billions of dollars from the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Neither the Assembly nor any other mechanism can annul sovereignty immunity, which States assets have under international law, he emphasized. Those delegations which support the draft resolution will be implicated in the illegal expropriation of sovereignty assets. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations, as the draft resolution is being put forward by States with a rich record of looting the rest of the world through colonialism, slavery and the exploitation of natural resources. The countries of the West never considered reparations as a way of atoning for their own sins, he said, adding that if adopted, the draft resolution will have systemic consequences for the Organization.\n\nOLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, recalled how, on 2 March, the General Assembly with an overwhelming majority confirmed that the Russian Federation committed an aggression against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. \"Damage inflicted on Ukraine is huge,\" he said. Under international law, the responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful act. The draft resolution recommends the creation by Member States and Ukraine of a register of damage. That register will serve as a repository of evidence of all types of damage.\n\nThe resolution also recognizes the need for the establishment of an international claims mechanism for reparation for damage as a second step, he continued. Rather than charging the domestic legal system of Ukraine and other States with a potentially very high number of individual litigations, a centralized and specialized system would be more appropriate. \"Russia must be held to account for its wrongful acts and wanton destruction,\" he stressed. Every country enjoys the right to document crimes committed against its population, territory or cultural property in order to secure a proper investigation.\n\nSOPHIA TESFAMARIAM ( Eritrea ), speaking on behalf of a Group of Like-Minded Countries, stressed that the Assembly is not a judicial body. Its resolutions represent the political will of States and can in no way serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts as such an action would go beyond its mandate and responsibilities, she said. As such, the draft resolution does not have sufficient legal basis, is not in line with the established practice and would only promote a divisive agenda within the Assembly. The texts adoption, she warned, would set a dangerous precedent that would allow for the Assemblys \"blessing\" to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed nor accountable to the organ responsible for creating it. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she noted.\n\nAs national positions must be respected, the Assembly must play a positive role in ensuring the conflict in Ukraine is resolved through diplomatic efforts and means while avoiding any initiative that might further aggravate the situation on the ground and escalate tensions, she emphasized. Sovereign States must not be forced to take specific sides in the conflict. Any attempt to entrench a cold warera mentality and block politics based on confrontation, deepening divisions and the imposition of disparate visions and agendas must be rejected by all, she urged.\n\nANDREJS PILDEGOVIS ( Latvia ), speaking on behalf of the eight NordicBaltic countries, recalled that the Russian Federations brutal invasion has created Europes largest humanitarian tragedy since World War II. More than 17 million people have been displaced, while three million must get by without water, electricity, sanitation and heating. Russian armed forces have deliberately attacked critical infrastructure, including energy grids, power interconnectors and water stations. Collecting and preserving evidence is important because the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its internationally wrongful acts against Ukraine and its people, he emphasized.\n\nHe quoted the President of Ukraine as having told journalists a few hours earlier that investigators had uncovered more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson area after it was abandoned by Russian forces. There must be no impunity for these crimes and perpetrators must be held to account. Reiterating the NordicBaltic countries firm support for Ukraine, he urged the Russian Federation to abide by international law and uphold its international commitments. He also called for the SecretaryGeneral and the United Nations to continue efforts to restore respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.\n\nKRZYSZTOF SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) underscored the need for an unambiguous and comprehensive response from the international community. As accountability must remain the priority as the war continues, the Russian Federation must be held responsible for the consequences of all its violations, including reparations for the injury and damage caused by its glaring and largescale violation of its international obligations, he stressed. Poland supports the creation of an international register of damage, he said while calling for all damages to be always and appropriately compensated. \"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars\", he stressed. The proposed register, he continued, will not only assist Ukraine in rebuilding itself but will also bring justice to the victims of the Russian Federations barbaric acts.\n\nMOHAN MAITHRI PIERIS ( Sri Lanka ), noting that the most urgent step is to engage in talks for a ceasefire, stressed that an attempt to provide justification through a General Assembly resolution to seizure sovereign assets of one party would amount to an overreach of the application of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Further pointing out that the Assembly is a political body for deliberation, he underscored that it cannot determine State responsibility or usurp the sovereign immunity of State property under international law. Highlighting that the register initiative creates a dangerous precedent, he emphasized that it may result in compelling the parties to resort to a more lethal and sophisticated method of engaging in the conflict.\n\nABDULAZIZ M. ALWASIL ( Saudi Arabia ), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the Council is very concerned with the crisis in Ukraine and its humanitarian, economic and political consequences. The Council aligns itself with the fundamental principles of respect for international law and the United Nations Charter that govern relations between countries, he said, urging all parties to respect their obligations under international law. The best course is to reach a settlement by diplomatic means that serves the interests of all parties. The draft resolution is based on the main principles and guidelines of redress adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 147/60 in 2005, he noted, adding that any mechanism must be based on procedures and standards that are internally accepted and under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide redress and reparations in a fair manner. He expressed the Councils hope of finding a satisfactory solution and supported all humanitarian initiatives that achieve this purpose and bring peace to the region.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) spotlighted the continued damage and loss to Ukraine and its people caused by the Russian Federations unprovoked and illegal invasion. The scenes of relief and joy as Ukrainian civilians in Kherson greet Ukraines liberating armed forces, she noted, should leave the international community with no doubt about the cruel and destructive nature of the Russian Federations invasion. It will take a broad international effort to support Ukraines recovery and construction in order to build a safe and prosperous future for its people, she continued. Only one country is responsible for the damage to Ukraine, must pay for that damage and must be held to account for actions that are in clear violation of international law, she said before expressing her support for establishing a register of damage as an important first step towards justice.\n\nISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ) recalled that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime and that responsibility for these actions must be held. \"Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force must not occur in any corner of the globe,\" he said, adding that the draft resolution, if adopted, should contribute to reparations for the serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Russian Federation must immediately stop its war of aggression, withdraw all its troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and respect Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he added.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ) said that it is the General Assemblys responsibility \"to do all we can\" to avoid the deadly consequences of war. \"We see accountability and reparation processes as an important element in avoiding and forestalling further perpetuation of grave atrocities,\" she added. New Zealand is strongly committed to supporting international mechanisms that seek accountability for the Russian Federations clear breaches of international law. In addition to mechanisms that seek accountability, New Zealand believes that future reparation processes can play a critical role in the rebuilding of communities, he said. Those that are responsible for causing damage and injury by breaching international law must make full reparations for rebuilding and compensating Ukraine. \"The principles at stake in Ukraine are deeply significant to New Zealand as a small State acting in the world,\" she said, urging the Russian Federation to commit to dialogue and act in the interests of peace.\n\nDANG HOANG GIANG ( Viet Nam ) expressed concern over recent developments in the situation in Ukraine, with few prospects for an early resolution. \"We cannot let cooperation and dialogue take the back seat,\" he emphasized. While noting the importance of resolving the \"war legacies\" for reconstruction, maintenance of peace, stability and prosperity for the livelihoods of the people of Ukraine, he stressed that the immediate task is to respond adequately to the urgent humanitarian needs of those impacted by hostilities in the country. He further pointed out that the international community should refrain from actions that may drive the parties further apart and delay the prospects of a peaceful settlement.\n\nMITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ), emphasizing that \"we will not be fooled by Russias misinformation and obfuscation,\" said the draft resolution does not overstep the Assemblys powers in any way. Rather, it simply recognizes fundamental principles of international law by which all States, including the Russian Federation, must abide. A register of damage and a reparations mechanism, appropriately constructed, will be an important component of a fair, impartial and just framework for determining the reparations that the Russian Federation must make to ensure lasting peace. He urged all Member States to continue to support this and all other efforts to ensure that the Russian Federation ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and to make reparations for the injury and damage it has caused.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) spotlighted the Russian Federations footprint of destruction. While the United Nations and other organizations have reported continuously on the significant and widespread damages caused by the Russian Federations aggression, there is a need to have a detailed map of what has happened to have a full picture of this man-made catastrophe, he emphasized. In expressing his support for the resolution, he called on all Member States to vote in favour as an act of justice and dignity. It is very straightforward, he explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability. The Russian Federation must silence the guns, withdraw completely and unconditionally from Ukraine and engage in negotiations. \"Ukraine is home to Ukrainians. It does not have to become the graveyard of Russian soldiers,\" he said.\n\nROBERT KEITH RAE ( Canada ) said the resolution is not about seizing assets or dealing with State sovereignty; rather, it is about saying there must be a registry for there to be an eventual reckoning for the damage and destruction that has been caused. When one country attacks another country, it is a breach of the law, and it is against the rules. The Russian Federation has prevented the Security Council from functioning and has tried to tie up the General Assembly and the Council in knots because it cannot bring itself to admit that its Special Military Operation is not that at all but rather a systematic attack on Ukraine. The Russian Federation is attempting to freeze and starve the people of Ukraine. \"Of course, we need to find peace,\" he said, but the one and only country that can secure peace refuses to accept responsibility for its own aggression. The Assembly is not being asked to perform the function of judge or jury or to go too far, it is simply saying there should be a registry and Ukraine and other countries should be allowed to support that registry.\n\nMICHAL MLYNR ( Slovakia ), associating himself with the European Union, and recalling the Assemblys demand for the Russian Federation to cease its aggression against Ukraine and to withdraw from its internationally recognized borders, said today is an opportunity to address Moscows second obligation under customary international law. He asked delegates to imagine that their countries neighbour had launched a brutal and illegitimate military aggression that resulted in enormous damage against them. Would they not want the international community to hold the aggressor to account with an obligation to pay reparations, he wondered. \"I believe the answer is clear,\" he said, urging delegates to vote in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nMAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, said that, despite strong condemnations, the Russian Federations violent actions continue to cause suffering and destruction in Ukraine. \"The picture that is emerging after Russias recent withdrawal from Kherson is once again one of destruction and pain inflicted on the local population,\" he said. The draft resolution does not establish any standing United Nations reparation or compensation mechanism. It is instead aimed at providing global legitimacy by recommending to Member States the creation of an international register of damage. Such register will coordinate and organize evidencegathering efforts, including those carried out in the context of various investigations by United Nations bodies. \"Ukraine needs reparations to have the possibility of rebuilding itself after the war housing for its people, schools, hospitals, roads, railways and bridges, as well as its industry and power grid all that was destroyed by Russia during its invasion and occupation,\" he added.\n\nFERGAL MYTHEN ( Ireland ), associating himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation faces legal consequences arising from its continued breaches of international law. Explaining that the draft resolution recognizes and affirms Moscows clear obligation to cease its wrongful acts and to make reparations, he said that an international register of damage would not only preserve evidence of damage, loss and injury but also shed light on atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people. It would be an important first step towards accountability, he said, adding that reparations will alleviate some of the longterm consequences of this horrific war.\n\nBASSAM SABBAGH ( Syria ), aligning himself with the Group of LikeMinded Countries, pointed out that \"Western countries\" are promoting political polarization within the United Nations to deepen the divide among its Member States. He stressed that the organ should avoid any initiative which exacerbates the conflict and prevents its peaceful resolution. Noting that the draft resolution is part of a series of \"unbalanced bias and provocative resolutions\" pushed by the United States and its Western partners, he stated that its real objective is to pay for the increasing purchases of weapons by Ukraine. In this regard he asked the Assembly: \"Who will compensate my country for the destruction of the Syrian infrastructure by the socalled international coalition?\"\n\nJASSER JIMNEZ ( Nicaragua ), echoing the statement of the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the resolution is an example of the hypocrisy and double standards of certain countries. Nicaragua supports a robust multilateralism and a new international order with a deep transformation between countries, he said, calling for an end to double standards and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution shamelessly seeks to politicize the Organization by setting up an international mechanism that is not administered by the body that established it, he said. This is a mechanism for a single case and ignores the painful history that imperialist countries have left behind. It does not recognize the genocide against the original peoples of countries. He supported his brethren in the Caribbean and Africa that are seeking reparations for these losses. Sanctions are direct aggressions against people, and during the pandemic, they have become crimes against humanity, he said, calling for reparations for damage caused by Western countries. He said that in 1986 the International Court of Justice condemned the United States for hostilities against Nicaragua and ordered $17 billion in compensation. It is a decision that the United States has not complied with. Developing countries have been demanding a reparation mechanism for the damage created by climate change. The resolution is a divisive act in the Assembly and does not promote dialogue. It sets a dangerous precedent as it is not administered by the Assembly and his delegation will vote against it.\n\nCORNEL FERU ( Romania ), aligning himself with the European Union, said the resolution is an additional step towards accountability for the Russian Federations blatant violations of international law. Its provisions, he noted, complement existing international efforts concerning individual criminal responsibility by adding the missing dimension of the States responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts. Ukraines case for reparations, he continued, is a moral and legal imperative which constitutes an important deterrent to the benefit of the entire community. If the aggressor is left unsanctioned, this could lead to an irreversible decay of the international order which generations have strived to build in the aftermath of the world wars, he warned. As its provisions do not establish any new entities, the resolution undertakes a modest and principled step by recognizing the need for an international mechanism for reparation and recommending the creation of an international register of damage, he emphasized.\n\nSONG KIM ( Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea ) stressed that the draft resolution is \"nothing more than a politically motivated document\" to shift all responsibilities of the crisis in Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Pointing out that the text is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, he further noted that the Assembly is not a judicial organ and has no mandate to judge the internationally wrongful acts and to provide the legal ground for remedy and reparations. Voicing concern over the possibility of abusing this draft resolution as a basis to illegally seize property and assets of a sovereign State, he opposed the text as a \"product of a unilateral and double standard practice.\"\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) said that the draft resolution contains obvious flaws and loopholes. Elaborating, he said that the Assembly is not an international judicial body, and therefore it cannot define or hold accountable international wrongful acts. Moreover, the draft resolution aims to invoke articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, but these articles are only the research products of the International Law Commission, an expert body, and they are not legally binding. In addition, creating a register of damage outside the framework of the United Nations is a diversion from past practice that makes no sense and has no precedent. Such draft resolutions should be subjected to full consultations with a view to achieving a consensus that can stand the test of history. Regrettably, the co-sponsors of this text did not organize consultations in earnest, pushing instead for the Assembly to take unconstructive, hasty action. Declaring that China will vote against the draft resolution, he called on the parties to the crisis to return to dialogue and negotiation, with the Assembly working actively towards that end instead of aggravating divisions.\n\nNATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ), associating herself with the European Union, reiterated her countrys commitment to Ukraine and its people in ensuring justice for all victims of the Russian Federations illegal war. Victims must be respected in terms of their dignity and rights, she emphasized while spotlighting her countrys support for Ukraine legal actions and to the international efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. As the Russian Federation must be held responsible for its crimes, its flagrant violations of international law and the legal consequences of its wrongful actions, she called on the Assembly to support the draft resolution.\n\nMATHU JOYINI ( South Africa ) said that the impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt all over the world. South Africa reiterates that the territorial integrity of all States, including that of Ukraine, must be respected and rejects all actions that undermine principles laid out in the United Nations Charter. The Security Council should play a constructive role in resolving this conflict, she added, expressing regret that the Council continues to fail the people of Ukraine. The General Assembly, for its part, should create conditions conducive to dialogue, mediation and diplomacy. That, after all, is the only path to peace. The United Nations should do more to devote equal time to the resolution of all conflict situations that threaten international peace and security. She expressed concern that the General Assembly was \"sending a message of exceptionalism\" and that reparations matter in some situations but not others. Member States must refrain from double standards. The draft resolution places the United Nations in uncharted waters. The General Assembly is being asked to grant its authority to the setting up of a reparations mechanism, but there is no clarity on what the mechanism will look like or what its eventual legal status will be. \"We are uncomfortable\" with the draft text, she said, noting that South Africa will abstain from todays vote.\n\nYOKA BRANDT ( Netherlands ), aligning herself with the European Union, stressed that the evidence of damages caused by the Russian Federation might disappear or get lost under the fog of war, therefore pointing to the need for a registry as outlined in the draft resolution. The text establishes that the aggressor is liable for the damages, she added, which must be documented in a register to allow for compensations. Recalling that the Assembly has established a register for damages in the past, she underscored that it is within its competence to recommend establishing one for this case. She called on Member States to \"vote for justice for all those who have suffered damages in the unprovoked conflict\".\n\nVALENTIN RYBAKOV ( Belarus ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the draft resolution introduced today once again shows that Western States have given up on principles of multilateralism and cooperation with the United Nations. Through the Minsk agreements, his delegation did all it could to organize negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Yet the Western States, the guarantors, did not really want to have the situation resolved, he said. Instead, they endorsed the fomenting escalation in the Donbas region in 2014, supported Ukraine and pumped weapons into it, creating the pre-conditions for todays situation, in which both countries have become an existential threat to each other. The draft does not stand up to the cross-scrutiny of international law. It does not mention the crimes of imperialists and the consequences of slavery, he said, pointing out that no one has paid reparations for these types of damages, which are not even possible to assess. The draft does not mention the economic terrorism of sanctions that suffocate whole peoples. The war in Ukraine is one of 30 armed conflicts in the world. The Assembly should not make an exemption for one country, he stressed. The text will not bring the situation one step closer to peace; it will just polarize the Assembly. As such, his delegation will vote against it, he said.\n\nPEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA ( Cuba ), calling on all parties to protect civilians, their property and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, rejected the double standards, partiality, discriminatory selectivity and opportunistic approaches before the Assembly. Spotlighting the hypocrisy of its main promoters, he urged States to listen and address the compensation claims of Caribbean Community (CARICOM), developing countries and small island developing States among others. The Assembly, he noted, has never established a reparations mechanism for Member States suffering from unilateral coercive measures. Will Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory, he asked before turning his attention to Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine. To limit and accelerate the creation of a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and welldocumented demands is unjust and morally unacceptable, he said. It also severely damages the Assemblys credibility, he added.\n\nAMIR SAEID JALIL IRAVANI ( Iran ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, noted that the draft resolution contains language outside of the Assemblys purview. If agreed upon, the proposed mechanism would have no actual contribution to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and would only serve as a political tool, he cautioned. The main sponsors of the draft resolution, he explained, apply different criteria in other conflicts in a blatant double standard. If an international mechanism is to be established, then it must have a broad mandate that could address any international wrongdoing, including military aggressions, looting, blockades, unilateral sanctions, occupation and the provision of weapons of mass destruction, he contended. Objecting to any mechanism which undermines international law, he pointed out that any acts or decisions of the mechanism in operative paragraphs 3 or 4 would have no legal status and thus be null and void.\n\nRICHARD M. MILLS, JR. ( United States ) said that it is clear what the issue is before the Assembly, namely that the international community must hold the Russian Federation to account for its violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the ensuing damage and abuses. \"This resolution represents a critical step towards accountability,\" he said, describing as tremendous the mounting cost of the Russian Federations unprovoked and unlawful invasion of its neighbour and fellow United Nations member. Pointing to Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter, he said that it is well within the Assemblys authority to adopt the draft resolution and create a damages register that will be an important first step towards a claims adjudication mechanism. This is a matter of justice, not geopolitical competition, and by adopting the text, the Assembly will send a strong message to would-be aggressors worldwide that violations of international law, including the Charter, will have consequences. A vote in favour of the draft resolution is a vote for accountability and for the defence of the Charter, he said, emphasizing that Member States cannot sit on the sidelines when fundamental principles of international law are at stake.\n\nSILVA LEANDER, representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , in its capacity as observer, pointed out that Ukraine will require assistance for further strengthening its democratic institutions, which will be essential for successfully countering corruption and achieving its reconstruction. Noting that the Russian Federation has targeted not only strategic military infrastructure but also civilian targets, public services, supply networks and sectors, she stressed the need to include political and civil society institutions and actors at the local level in Ukraine as \"critical infrastructure\". Emphasizing that the coming process of reconstitution and recovery needs to place democracy at its centre, she deemed it vital to allocate resources to support the reconstruction and improvement of the countrys democratic institutions.\n\nAction\n\nThe representative of Bahamas , speaking on behalf of CARICOM in explanation of vote before the vote, said CARICOM subscribes to the principle that for every wrong, there is a remedy. This is a fundamental principle of law and equity and an equally fundamental principle of international law. Ukraine has experienced injury and the burden of compensation should be imposed on the perpetrator. CARICOM recognizes that the United Nations is vital to resolving international matters. While supporting Ukraines legitimate claims for reparations, he said such a process must be pursued through an appropriate mechanism. The proposal in the resolution contemplates that the Assembly should endorse a process over which it would have no control, oversight or any role. As drafted, the resolution asks Member States to give approval and then trust the process will be continued fairly and objectively.\n\nReferring to language in operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, he said CARICOM will abstain from a vote. Yet the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all its wrongful acts for any violations of international law and/or for any violations of international humanitarian law in or against Ukraine. He reiterated his strong support for the principle that Member States have a legitimate right to claim reparations and compensation for injury, loss and damage caused by the wrongful actions of other Member States. This principle is to be applied in the present case as well as other similar cases worldwide. CARICOM has made this broader point regarding several issues before the international community, including climate action and reparations in connection with the transatlantic slave trade and native genocide. \"There will always exist a moral and/or legal obligation to correct injustice including the legacy of past injustice,\" he said.\n\nThe representative of Mexico , reiterating his countrys defence of Ukraines sovereignty, national unity, independence and territorial integrity, noted the ongoing judicial processes which could lead to the establishment of reparation mechanisms. The reparations stage is still far away, he pointed out, since the conflict is ongoing and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, he said he will vote in favour of the resolution since the resolution limits itself to recommending the creation of a register of damages.\n\nJOAQUN PREZ ( Venezuela ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, rejected attempts to impose a draft resolution that does not receive any consultations or take into account the views of all States involved. Such a methodology will not bring the international community closer to its goal of achieving peace. Rather, it will bring the Assembly closer to a point of no return. The draft resolution represents double standards and is not a peaceful solution. It attempts to use the Assembly to confiscate the properties and assets of other States and advances dubious aims. He said his country knows first-hand the looting of its sovereign resources. The text does not include measures for accountability, and there are no details on how it would be implemented. It does not follow a rules-based order. The proponents of the draft are shamelessly ignoring the crimes committed by colonial powers. The same members taking the lead on the resolution ignore the developing worlds demand for reparations. \"It is moral amnesia,\" he said. He appealed to other delegations to vote against the text, which would create a serious precedent for the Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions.\n\nThe representative of Egypt , in explanation of vote after the vote, noted that he abstained from the vote since the proposal sets a dangerous precedent in asking for the development of a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the United Nations without clarifying the mechanisms rules, working methods or subsequent measures. The role of the Organization and the Assembly has unprecedentedly not been specified, he added. He then turned his attention to the divergent views on the International Law Commissions draft articles. This topic should not have been considered before the achievement of consensus in the Sixth Committee(Legal), he emphasized. In noting the double standard approach of certain States, he expressed his preference for the Assembly to abstain. The Assembly, he cautioned, must undertake a coherent approach going forward on its practices, ability and willingness to create similar reparation mechanisms for other countries.\n\nThe representative of Brazil said he abstained since the resolution does not foster constructive dialogue nor recognize the central role of the United Nations in the process. The text brings a high level of uncertainty regarding the legal parameters of such a register to be created outside the framework of the United Nations and without its supervision, he noted. In recommending the creation of such a mechanism without a specified scope, the Assembly is encouraging the fragmentation of its collective responsibility in promoting peace. It undermines the United Nations and ignores the efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, he emphasized before voicing his regret over the insufficient time for discussion. The emergency special session must be capable of acting in a more transparent and democratic fashion, he urged while referencing the deadlock in the Security Council.\n\nThe representative of Chile said her countrys vote in favour of the resolution is representative of its respect for human rights. She also expressed concern that some delegations in the Sixth Committee (Legal) have been unwilling to negotiate a convention on a binding framework to provide legal certainty regarding the international responsibility of States. Chile calls on those delegations to modify their position. Chile also recognizes that Assembly resolutions have a non-binding character. Further, she said she hopes a reparations fund will be established for relatives of victims of femicide and other violent deaths of women. Chile calls on all parties to continue negotiations and find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia called the resolution \"divisive\", while also recognizing the efforts of the facilitators to provide room for some consultation. The underlying message of the resolution should have been that war must stop and that sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. On the recommendation to establish a registry of damage and a reparations mechanism, he highlighted that such mechanisms must be built upon a foundation of due process. \"The General Assembly resolution at this stage may lead us to a slippery slope,\" he warned. For these reasons, Indonesia abstained from the resolution.\n\nThe representative of India , emphasizing the conflicts impact on the Global South, said delegations need to consider whether a reparation process, initiated through the Assembly, will contribute to resolving the conflict. Such a mechanism must not be established without adequate legal vetting, she said, adding that Member States must avoid steps that might preclude or endanger the possibility of dialogue and negotiations which could bring the conflict to an end. For that reason, India decided to abstain, she said.\n\nThe representative of Singapore said his delegation supported the resolution on the understanding that it is without prejudice to, nor does it seek to undermine or prejudge, the outcomes of ongoing judicial and investigative processes related to the war in Ukraine. Moreover, in Singapores view, the approach contained in the resolution is not automatically applicable to other conflicts, as every situation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law into account, he added.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan , noting that while his country supports the establishment of a claims commission, stressed that any such mechanism must be based on sound legal foundations. Double standards in the application of international law are counterproductive, he emphasized, underscoring that it would be unprecedented to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed by nor accountable to any of the United Nations principal organs, including the Assembly. Irrespective of the origin of the conflict, he added, the highest priority at this moment is immediate cessation of hostilities and dialogue for peace.\n\nThe representative of Kenya stated that, while Ukraine has a sovereign right to make claims for damages and losses caused by the current conflict, so do all peoples and countries that have sought reparations for colonial violence, slavery and other acts of aggression. Noting that this text will pave the way for more concrete discussions, decisions and resolutions on reparation, he emphasized that all Member States should be ready to hear other countries calls for accountability for historical injustices.\n\nThe representative of Brunei Darussalam condemned violations of the sovereignty or territorial integrity of any country and firmly upheld the principles for the respect of international law. Regarding the establishment of a register of damage, she said similar mechanisms have been established under the ambit of the United Nations. Any such independent mechanism should be established according to due process and consultations. She reiterated the importance of diplomacy and called on all parties directly involved to deescalate and resolve the situation by peaceful means, stressing the need to refrain from force and maintain international peace and stability.\n\nThe representative of Argentina said her delegations clear and consistent position has been to defend territorial integrity as a fundamental principle of international law. Any damages must be subject to reparations under international law. She supported the draft resolution as it would achieve accountability for wrongful acts that violate the Charter. She stressed the importance of indicating the damages for such wrongful acts and discussing appropriate means for accountability, bearing in mind that accountability for unlawful acts must apply to all acts that need reparations, without prejudice. For this reason, her delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nThe representative of Qatar , in calling on parties to show restraint and stop the war, said he voted in favour of the resolution since it is in line with his countrys position on the protection of civilians and the provision of reparations for material and psychological damages. Reparations and the mechanisms to implement them, however, must be conducted in accordance with the principles of international law and established international precedents, he stressed.\n\nThe representative of the United Arab Emirates , associating himself with the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he abstained due to the texts unclear and imprecise nature. The resolution offers the Assemblys support for reparations and evidentiary processes that have yet to be defined by a group of Member States still to be determined, he pointed out while expressing his concern over the resolutions implications for sovereign equality and sovereign immunity.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria called on all parties to the conflict to end hostilities and begin negotiations. Nigeria is committed to the principles of the United Nations and calls on all countries to refrain from actions that will worsen the conflict. Current efforts should focus on resuming peace. Nigeria is open to working with all countries on these goals, he said, adding that for such reasons Nigeria abstained from the vote.\n\nThe representative of Sierra Leone reiterated grave concern about the conflict in Ukraine, which has had widespread repercussions all over the world. Sierra Leone is committed to the United Nations Charter and its principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, he said. Noting that his delegations prior votes on the issue of Ukraine have been based on the Charter principles, he said today Sierra Leone abstained from the resolution and was guided by its belief in the Charter and the consistent application of international law. The General Assembly is not an adjudicative body and cannot set out legal consequences; it must recognize all victims of historical injustices, including racism, colonialism and slavery. \"Reparations concern both the past and the present,\" he added.",

As of now, the U.S. has no indications any missiles have been sent, a senior U.S. defense official said.\n\nIf delivered, they would be the first advanced, precision-guided missiles that Iran has provided Russia since the war started. Short-range ballistic missiles have a range of hundreds of miles, and could help Moscow replenish its dwindling stockpile, which have been depleted by Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nTwo of the officials say the surface-to-surface missiles are expected to be part of a tranche of roughly 1,000 additional weapons including more weaponized drones that Iran could transfer to Russia by the end of this year.\n\nA man works among the rubble of his destroyed home on Sunday after Russia's invasion of Chernihiv, Ukraine. Ed Ram / Getty Images\n\n\"We remain concerned about the potential for Iran to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles,\" White House National Security Council adviser John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday. \"They are very actively involved in supporting Russia and its efforts to kill innocent Ukrainians and to damage Ukraines civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on Oct. 16 that Iran planned to send short-range surface-to-surface missiles to Russia, citing U.S. and allied security officials. The White House said on Oct. 20 that it was concerned Iran may provide surface-to-surface missiles to Russia.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force Command, told reporters that Ukrainian forces would do whatever it could to counter any Iranian missiles that Russia places across Ukraines northern border. Still, he said, Ukraine only has air defense systems, not missile defense, making that task extremely difficult.\n\nIrans Mission to the United Nations didnt respond to a request for comment. But previously, Iran has firmly denied selling armed drones to Russia for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, calling those allegations \"unsubstantiated.\"\n\n\"Such unfounded claims, which are solely based on false flags and fabricated assumptions, are nothing more than a propaganda apparatus launched by certain states to further their political agenda,\" Irans government said in a statement on Oct. 14.\n\nThe Biden administration has also accused Iran of sending military trainers and technical advisers to Crimea to help Russias military use Iranian-made drones. Russian military bases in Crimea, which the Kremlin illegally annexed in 2014, have been a key staging ground for Russias attacks against Ukraine since the war started in February.\n\n\"A week or so ago, we had solid information that they did have personnel on the ground. It wasnt a very large number,\" Kirby said Tuesday. \"But whether theyre still there, or in what number, I couldnt say today.\"\n\nIrans preparations for a potential missile transfer come amid stalled U.S. efforts to resurrect a deal with Tehran and world powers to address Irans nuclear weapons program, with the U.S. saying talks are at an \"impasse.\"\n\nThe U.S. has long maintained sanctions on Iran separate from and in addition to nuclear-related sanctions that were eased under the 2015 nuclear deal, which collapsed after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact in 2018.\n\nRichard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that advocates a hard-line position on Iran, said the potential weapons shipment provided another reason for the U.S. to back away from efforts to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program.\n\n\"With reports that Iran plans to send short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine and as the people of Iran cry out in the streets for a change in regime the U.S. and its European allies should withdraw all sanctions relief offers made to Tehran and complete the snapback of U.N. sanctions at the Security Council,\" Goldberg said.",

According to 14 Oct report by Reuters news agency, opposition leaders agreed to hold primaries in June 2023 ahead of 2024 presidential election. However, 19 Oct communiqu outlining rules for primaries did not mention enlisting collaboration of National Electoral Council, suggesting participation could be severely curtailed due to inadequate technical capabilities; participation could also be limited as most members of Venezuelan diaspora, now around seven mn, will not be able to participate due to onerous conditions for registration and lack of access to consulates. Meanwhile, at OAS General Assembly held 5-7 Oct in Perus capital Lima, motion challenging status of opposition leader Juan Guaids representative, Gustavo Tarre, as Venezuelas permanent representative at OAS failed to obtain required 2/3 majority.

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Ukrainian military's General Staff said in its daily update that Russian troops in the east continued their attacks on Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, and Novopavlivka, the focal points of Moscow's offensive in Donetsk in recent weeks.\n\nAt the same time, the military said, Russian troops continue to shell critical infrastructure and civilian objectives in various regions of Ukraine.\n\nIn his regular video address, Zelenskiy on November 7 called the intense combat in the Donetsk region \"the epicenter of the biggest madness of the occupiers.\"\n\n\"They are dying in hundreds every day,\" Zelenskiy said. \"The ground in front of the Ukrainian positions is literally littered with the bodies of the occupiers.\"\n\nZelenskiy also said that Russian soldiers in the Pavlivka area had complained to the governor of their region in the Russian Far East.\n\nCNN reported on November 7 that in a letter purportedly sent from the front lines to Primorsky region Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, the men of the 155th Brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet Marines say they were thrown into an \"incomprehensible battle\" in the Donetsk and had lost about 300 men, dead and wounded, in four days, while also losing 50 percent of their equipment.\n\nZelenskiy said that in response to the letter, Kozhemyako had said that the losses were \"not that big\" and they were \"exaggerated.\"\n\nIn Kherson, the only pocket of Russian-held territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine, Moscow has ordered civilians out of the city in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city.\n\nKherson, with a prewar population of nearly 300,000, has no power or running water, both sides said.\n\nRussian-installed officials blamed Ukrainian \"sabotage,\" while Ukrainian officials said the Russians had dismantled 1 1/2 kilometers of power lines.\n\nUkraine's military said Russian forces, \"disguised in civilian clothes, occupy the premises of civilians and strengthen positions inside for conducting street battles.\"\n\nRussian forces were \"involved in looting and theft from residents and from infrastructure sites and are taking away equipment, food, and vehicles to the Russian Federation,\" it said in an update late on November 7.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported hits on a Russian antiaircraft facility, ammunition dump, and the destruction of Russian armor in the Beryslav district of the Kherson region, in its November 8 statement.

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight The shipments include \"thousands\" of shells, John Kirby, the National Security Councils coordinator for strategic communications, told reporters. He characterized the number as \"significant\" but not enough to alter the wars trajectory \"in any appreciable way.\"\n\nKirby would not disclose how the North Koreans might be shipping the artillery shells or which countries are thought to be transfer points, saying only, \"We do have a sense of where theyre going\" and that the United States would \"continue to look at what our options are.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations about North Korea come on top of evidence that Russia also has leaned on Iran and specifically Iranian-made drones to supplement its war effort in Ukraine. That Moscow has turned to both pariah states which have spent years under punishing sanctions aimed at squelching their nuclear weapons development is \"a sign of Russias own article shortages and needs,\" Kirby said.\n\nHe credited \"the efficacy of international sanctions\" for hobbling Russias defense industrial base to the point where Russian President Vladimir Putin had to seek help from North Korea an option the Biden administration first suggested Putin was pursuing several weeks ago.\n\n\"Back in September, we had indications that Russia was willing to buy,\" Kirby said. \"Now we have indications that Russia has purchased and theyre on the move.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are practical limitations to getting Russia those weapons especially if Moscow wants them swiftly.\n\n\"Artillery is very, very heavy. So sending it by ship is going to take weeks,\" said Bruce W. Bennett, a defense researcher with the Rand Corp. and an expert on both Northeast Asia and the Middle East. It is far likelier, he said, that North Korea would send at least some the shells through China, where trains could carry the load through Central Asia and to Iran making it nearly impossible for the United States and its allies to interdict the weapons before they reach their destination.\n\nIt is also possible, Bennett said, that North Korea is using multiple routes to keep the West guessing. Pyongyang would have to employ sea routes to get the artillery to North Africa, creating potentially more opportunities for the West to seize the weapons, but also keeping the Russians steadily supplied, he noted, adding, \"It may well be that part of the ammunition is traveling on a train and part of it is traveling on a ship because Russia thinks its going to be at this war for a protracted period of time.\"\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said Nov. 2 that North Korea is covertly supplying artillery shells to Russia to aid its war effort in Ukraine. (Video: Reuters)\n\nThough the White House did not specify which countries were serving as transfer points, there are a handful of likely candidates, given where Russia wields influence in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has close relations with Syria, where it has been President Bashar al-Assads primary military patron in an 11-year civil war that has become a standoff with rebel and extremist groups largely backed into a corner in the northwestern part of the country. Russia has control, under a bilateral agreement, of the naval base at Tartus, on the Mediterranean coast, as well as Hmeimim air base. Moscow has upgraded both facilities in recent years.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAssad also maintains relations with North Korea, which has been accused of providing the Syrian military with ballistic missiles and chemical weapons components in defiance of U.N. sanctions. In 2019, the two countries signed an economic cooperation agreement.\n\nIn North Africa, Russias Wagner Group mercenaries are reportedly present at bases and ports controlled by the Libyan National Army of rebel warlord Khalifa Hifter. Researchers say the group is present in more than a dozen nations on the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorth Korea has a network of military front companies in Africa that experts say make the choice of those midpoint countries advantageous as well.\n\n\"The North Koreans have established routes there that they could maneuver,\" said Ken Gause, an expert on North Korea with the think tank CNA, noting that \"the United States has a lot of surveillance over North Korea\" making direct routes via Siberia less attractive.\n\nEarlier this fall, North Korea vehemently denied allegations that it might be supplying weapons to Russia. That it is carrying out the deals is a sign, experts say, that the country is either beholden to Moscow or has something it wants to gain by doing this favor for Russia now.\n\nNorth Koreas prime occupation is its standing on the Korean Peninsula, where its protracted standoff with South Korea grew particularly testy Wednesday. Amid joint military drills between South Korea and the United States, the North conducted missiles launches, with one missile landing near South Korean waters, prompting Seoul to return fire.\n\nAdvertisement",

As a result of the protests, 253 people were killed, including 34 child protesters, according to Iran Human Rights (IHR) on 28 October.\n\nOn 13 September last, Mahsa Amini was killed after being detained by Iranian Morality Police elements for what the Iranian authorities consider to be a \"dress code violation,\" with accusations of Morality Police elements killing her under torture.\n\nAmnesty International has called for a \"criminal investigation into the circumstances (suspicious death) of 22-year-old Amini, which include allegations of torture and other ill-treatment during detention\".\n\nOn 11 October, Ali Khamenei, the Leader of the Iranian Revolution, commented on the protests and attributed them to \"external\" factors after their expansion and the imposition of Western sanctions on people accused of \"responsibility for repression.\"\n\nOn the 27th of the same month, the Iranian President, Ibrahim Raisi, considered that the \"riots\" were preparing the ground for \"terrorist attacks\" in response to the Shiraz incident.\n\nIn a report published by the American newspaper The Atlantic early this year, researcher and non-resident fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Kim Ghattas, said she feared that the Syrian scenario would be repeated in Iran, citing what happened in Syria when the Syrian regimes inability to deliver effective reforms motivated protests. With the use of violence against protesters, many of them took up arms, and groups were formed against the regime that adopted the \"scorched earth\" policy.\n\nAccording to the researcher, the protests could help weaken Irans \"grip on what it considers its forward defense bases\" in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq.\n\nIn Syria, \"swinging\" control map between the two allies\n\nAfter previous speculations about Russia reducing the number of its military forces in Syria to strengthen its fighting front in Ukraine, the talk has become a reality, manifested by several moves that Moscow has made for its forces on Syrian territory, the most recent of which is Russias recent withdrawal of \"sensitive\" military forces and equipment from Syria to enhance its military operations in Ukraine, according to a New York Times report quoting three senior officials residing in the Middle East on 19 October.\n\nTwo officials confirmed to the newspaper that the number of Russian troops withdrawn from Syria ranged from 1200 to 1600 military personnel. A third estimated that the number was much higher, indicating a general consensus on the reduction of the number of Russian fighting forces in Syria.\n\nThe newspaper noted that Russias \"faltering\" war in Ukraine had eroded Moscows influence elsewhere, particularly in Syria, which it has backed militarily since September 2015.\n\nMoscow redeployed several Russian leaders from Syria to Ukraine, and Russias military leadership in Moscow became less involved in the day-to-day management of operations in Syria, an Israeli official told the newspaper.\n\nThe talk of reducing Russian forces and equipment in Syria is not new, but it returns with every emergency and change in the map of military control over the fighting fronts and battles in Ukraine, in addition to Moscow appointing military leaders who fought and led battles in Syria, the latest of which was Moscows appointment of General Sergei Surovikin (Commander of the Russian Air Force in Syria since 31 October 2017) as commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine on 8 October.\n\nLast August, Russia shipped the advanced S-300 air defense system from Syria near the city of Masyaf, southwest of Hama, and relocated the systems radar to the Hmeimim military base, southeast of Latakia. The S-300 systems battery was transferred to the seaport of Tartus, from which it was loaded onto a Russian vessel bound for the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk.\n\nThe Moscow Times said last May that Russia had moved several military units from bases across Syria to three Mediterranean airports, estimated at more than 60,000 military personnel, half of whom were officers. These units were transferred to Ukraine, noting that the vacuum was filled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese Hezbollah, with information and numbers that were met with skepticism at the time.\n\nReduction of presence, no military vacuum\n\nRussian analyst and non-resident scholar in the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, Anton Mardasov, considered it wrong to say that Russia is seriously reducing its presence in Syria o some minimal limits precisely because of the war in Ukraine, noting that Russia had taken some measures (troop reductions) but within the framework of objective optimization.\n\nMardasov told Enab Baladi that the Russian defense system currently in Syria (an air group the size of an air regiment, Iskander missile systems, and others) allows the Russian military to perform previous tasks, including organizing exercises and patrols together with Turkey and separately in eastern Syria. Moscow had previously announced its serious intention to reduce the number of its forces in 2021, that is, before the start of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFor his part, the head of the Information Unit at the Omran Center for Strategic Studies, researcher Nawar Shaaban, believes that the military vacuum of Syrias allies, Iran and Russia, exists, but the security and administrative vacuum does not exist because Russia and Iran have moved to the second stage in Syria, which is the stage of administration with soft instruments. Russia is more adept at utilizing these instruments than Iran, while the latter is always trying to use soft non-circulating instruments to protect its militias by integrating them with the said instruments.\n\nSpeaking to Enab Baladi, Shaaban said that the Russian and Iranian military system operating in Syria had diminished its work since 2018, and its activity has become limited with regard to establishing a military reality that is currently proven; Russia and Iran worked on the principle of strengthening military forces to create a security reality in Syria previously, and they succeeded in that.\n\nRussia continues to conduct periodic and frequent patrols in several villages in the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor and on the international highway M4 in the regions of eastern Syria. It also recently conducted surveillance patrols on the border line with Jordan from the Nassib border crossing, south of Daraa, to the Syrian regimes Border Guard outpost No. 107 near the town of Khazma, southeast of As-Suwayda.\n\nThe Russian analyst pointed out that the talks of the Russian and Turkish presidents, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, are also related to the fact that for Moscow, any Turkish operation would entail the need to move additional forces into Syria, primarily military police, which the Kremlin needs to control the recently annexed territories of Ukraine.\n\nThe Moscow \"cease-fire\" agreement, signed between the Russian President and his Turkish counterpart, is the cornerstone to any military action in northwestern Syria. This agreement halted the map of military changes and the controlling forces since it was signed on 5 March 2020, although it was subjected to numerous violations, most notably the almost daily Russian bombing of opposition-held areas.\n\nDespite the withdrawal of the S-300 air defense system, Mardasov indicated that the S-400 system, in addition to other air defense assets, remained in the Masyaf region. Russia does not use it against Israel for several reasons, most notably its unwillingness to get involved in a regional confrontation.\n\nFor her part, Pr. Dara Conduit, a political science lecturer and non-resident scholar in the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, does not believe that Russia will withdraw from Syria, as its military campaign in Ukraine uses a completely different part of its army than its project in Syria, which mainly depends on its air force.\n\nResearcher Conduit told Enab Baladi that Russia has very clear interests in Syria, such as the Tartus sea port and the Hmeimim air base, which gives it strategic depth, including access to the Mediterranean Sea. Russia is also hoping for a return on its military investments through lucrative reconstruction projects that are still at the beginning, suggesting that Russia will not abandon these gains in the short term.\n\nIran is taking advantage of the Russian situation\n\nWith any talk of Moscow withdrawing or reducing its forces in Syria, attention turns to Iran, the other ally of the regime, coinciding with information, analysis, and speculations about Iran benefiting from the military situation in Russia and its preoccupation with Ukraine through Tehran strengthening many of its positions in Syria.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRG) has strengthened its military presence in Mahin warehouses in the Palmyra desert, the second largest arms and ammunition depot in Syria, after a complete withdrawal of the Russian forces and the Fifth Corps affiliated with it towards the Palmyra military airport, the Asharq Al-Awsat reported last April.\n\nThe Russian withdrawal from \"Mahin\" opened the door to a long geographical Iranian influence extending from the Qalamoun regions bordering Lebanon to the towns of Deir Atiyah, Mahin, al-Qaryatayn, and al-Sukhnah, east of Homs, reaching the areas of Athriya in the eastern countryside of Hama, and the oil fields in the south of al-Tabqa in the countryside of Raqqa governorate.\n\nDiaa Kaddour, a researcher covering Iranian affairs, told Enab Baladi that the vacuum that will happen by the Russians reducing their influence in Syria is greater than the Iranians ability to fill, especially since the strengthening of Irans strategic depth in Syria comes with high economic costs and fewer benefits for the Iranians who are besieged by Western sanctions.\n\nKaddour believes that the Iranians will seek to exploit this situation (reducing Russian forces in Syria) by only controlling important vital sectors in the various military, political and economic fields.\n\nIran is seeking as much as possible to establish control points and control the situation in light of the increasing weakness of the Russians and the regime against the backdrop of the Ukrainian war and the international unwillingness to move the stagnant Syrian waters, the researcher adds.\n\nLast May, the President of the Syrian regime, Bashar al-Assad, met his Iranian counterpart, Ibrahim Raisi, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on an official visit to Tehran, the second time that al-Assad visited Tehran since the outbreak of the Syrian revolution in 2011.\n\nThe visit brought with it a talk about the messages, connotations, and their purpose, amid the involvement of the regimes Russian ally in its war against Ukraine.\n\nIt was preceded by the visit of the former head of the regimes intelligence services and director of the National Security Office, Major General Ali Mamlouk, to meet with senior Iranian officials last February and the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian to Syria last March.\n\nIn a report published by the Al-Sharq Center for Strategic Research last June, it was considered that Iranian leaders had already sought to benefit from Assads concerns about the changing Russian role and increase their political space in Syria.\n\nThe think tank said Assads visit to Tehran is an initiative by Tehran to reassure Bashar al-Assad that he can still count on Irans full support, regardless of Russias role.\n\nThe report prepared by Hamid Reza Azizi, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that Iran is also trying to take advantage of the conditions in the economic field, as Iranian leaders hope that Russias economic problems as a result of Western sanctions on the one hand and the possibility of Iranian sanctions being lifted with the possibility of reviving the nuclear agreement of 2015 (JCPOA) on the other hand, may give Tehran greater room for maneuver in the economic reconstruction of post-war Syria as it has been increasingly marginalized by the Russians over the past four years.\n\nNo current repercussions\n\nTalks about Iran exploiting Russias preoccupation with Ukraine by seizing control of more sites and expanding its influence at Russias expense in Syria decreased with Tehrans involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine by providing Russia with missiles and drones and the wave of protests taking place in Iranian cities.\n\nResearcher Dara Conduit says that protests at home represent a big problem for Iran, especially the Revolutionary Guard, which was literally formed to protect the Iranian regime, and although the Iranian regime and the Revolutionary Guard will use all available resources to suppress that movement and protests, it is also important not to underestimate from the depth of the interests of the IRG in Syria.\n\nSyria is central to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) s world view, its regional goals, and its actual presence. Iran has spent huge political, financial, and military capital in Syria to achieve its goals, and I do not think it will give up easily. The matter is facilitated by the fact that Iran has foreign militias at its disposal in Syria, and even if the Revolutionary Guards attention is temporarily diverted from Syria, its military presence and influence will remain, and I do not expect a significant change in the Iranian presence in Syria at this stage. Lecturer in political science and non-resident researcher in the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, Dr. Dara Conduit\n\nThe expert on Iranian affairs, Diaa Kaddour, does not believe that there are any repercussions of the Iranian uprising on Iranian influence in Syria in the short term, with the possibility of influence in the long term, but this, in his opinion, depends on the extent of the continuity of the popular uprising in the face of the iron fist of the ruling Iranian regime.\n\nKaddour expected that the Russians drowning more and more in the long Ukrainian war would lead to the Iranians drowning with them and depleting their strategic stocks of drones and precision missiles.\n\nThis will, of course, affect Irans maneuvering capabilities in the region to arm regional agents and continue its policy of exporting \"violence and terrorism\" to the region, according to the expert.\n\nRussias dragging Iran into the Ukrainian war will have heavy costs on Iranian foreign policy in several international files, the most important of which is Iranian influence in Syria and the nuclear file. Diaa Kaddour, a writer and researcher on Iranian affairs\n\nFor his part, the Russian analyst and non-resident researcher in the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, Anton Mardasov, said that Moscow has little desire to continue competing with Iran for influence in Syria, in conjunction with the war in Ukraine and the aggravated sense of partnership in the anti-American coalition.\n\nHe pointed out that the Russian army left different sites dozens of times before the Russian war in Ukraine, which were then occupied by various loyalist groups.\n\nFifth Corps units have also been deployed all over Syria, and Moscow has \"illusions\" that they are agents of Russian interests, but this is an illusion, according to Mardasov, because these units have a questionable legal status from the point of view of the Assad regime.\n\nThe researcher, Nawar Shaaban, considered that the withdrawal of military forces from Russia and Iran would not affect Syria because there is no rival, and there is no one in the region, whether local or international, who dares to fill this void, and it is likely that the reality will continue as it is now.\n\nIs Assad weak while the allies are busy?\n\nBoth Russia and Iran played pivotal roles in preventing the collapse of the Syrian regime and provided it with continuous support during the previous years, but the two countries preoccupation and the hypothesis of the impact of this on the size of their presence in Syria created questions about the extent to which Assads strength is linked to their presence and the files that he may lose as a result.\n\nRussian analyst Anton Mardasov considers that Assad understands that he cannot do without Russian support. That is why he recently recognized the \"independence and sovereignty\" of both the \"Luhansk Peoples Republic\" and the \"Donetsk Peoples Republic,\" which were controlled by Russia with the support of separatist forces in Ukraine.\n\nMardasov believes that the Syrian regime found in the Russian invasion of Ukraine an opportunity for it to negotiate behind the scenes and expand maneuvering space behind Moscows back.\n\nHe added that it is clear that Damascus is trying to get certain preferences from its defenders and, at the same time, finding opportunities for diversification that neither Iran nor Russia can sabotage, such as stepping up contacts with the UAE and other regional players.\n\nIn recent months, the pace of combat exercises conducted by the Syrian regime forces under Russian supervision increased, in which parachute landings took the lead.\n\nLast week, the Syrian Ministry of Defense announced that the regimes ground and air forces had implemented a tactical, operational project with live ammunition over a period of several days in cooperation with \"friendly Russian forces operating in Syria.\"\n\nMardasov considered that these exercises under Russian supervision are taking place regularly, in accordance with the combat training schedule of the Russian army.\n\nHe explained that Russias focus on training the Tiger Forces (25th Special Forces Division) is due to the participation of its units in military operations in the Syrian desert, in addition to these exercises allowing Moscow to maintain the level of military cooperation at a difficult time for it.\n\nFor his part, writer and researcher on Iranian affairs, Diaa Kaddour, believes that Irans preoccupation is weakening Assad, as the decline in its military influence may severely weaken his current position.\n\nThis decline at various levels, including the economic one, could also have \"devastating\" effects on the regime that lives today on the Iranian economic \"ventilator,\" as he described it.\n\nKaddour considers that the talk that Assad is today at his weakest due to the preoccupation of his two main allies is theoretically correct, but there is nothing to support this talk at the present time on the ground, as both allies do not show any signs of the military, political or economic retreat on the Syrian soil, adding, \"Perhaps we should wait to see the long-term results of the Ukrainian war.\"\n\n\"Advance strategy to leave a safe distance\"\n\nPrior to all these events, an analysis report published on the Newlines Institute website in March 2021 said that Bashar al-Assad pursued a strategy aimed at leaving a certain safe distance between himself and Iran and Russia, which have become controlling large sectors in Syria.\n\nThe report clarified that \"al-Assad began to make quiet and pivotal changes in the security services and postponed others\" to re-establish his control over them, and it is one of the security branches in which Russia and Iran are deeply interfering, and what was considered that Assad is thus strengthening his trusted inner circle.\n\nThe report considered that the aim of these changes is to ensure that there is no coup against al-Assad and to protect himself by ensuring the loyalty of the heads of the main security offices, intelligence branches, and senior officers of the presidential palace, or to ensure that corruption does not spread in these agencies and branches, which makes al-Assad vulnerable to further Iranian and Russian infiltration by bribing officers and senior officials.\n\n\"Opportunity\" for the Syrian opposition\n\nClaims have emerged that did not go beyond social media pages, stating that the Syrian opposition has an \"opportunity\" to change the reality that has been going on in Syria for years, in light of speculation about the position of the Syrian regime at the present time, with the preoccupation of its two allies.\n\nAlthough military action is \"not currently possible\" in light of the Moscow \"cease-fire\" agreement signed in 2020 between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, there is still a political \"opportunity.\"\n\nThe reason lies in the fact that Russia and Iran, the \"busy\" ones, control the active negotiation tracks to reach a political solution in Syria. Russia and Iran, in addition to Turkey, control the Astana track as the guarantor countries, which gives them the opportunity to control the track and manipulate its course.\n\nThe Iranian and Russian role in manipulating and disrupting the Syrian political file is evident in turning the Astana talks on Syria into repeated rounds that do not make any progress.\n\nThis was confirmed by the final statement of the 18th round of talks in the Kazakh capital, Nur-Sultan, on 16 June, which did not differ in content from the previous rounds, and was limited to emphasizing the previous items.\n\nRussia also continues to obstruct the work of the Syrian Constitutional Committee (SCC) emanating from the Astana rounds by refusing to hold the committees meetings in Geneva, against the background of the Swiss position in Ukraine, and its proposal for alternative cities, a position supported by the Syrian regime, and rejected by the UN and the opposition.\n\nOpposition: Opportunity will not be repeated\n\nIn an interview with Enab Baladi, a member of the General Committee of the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), Nasr Hariri, said that benefiting from the current situation of the Syrian regime and its ally can be shared between the opposition and the countries that see Iran and Russia as a threat to them.\n\n\"The oppositions role today can be in two directions, the first of which is subjective and starts from improving the building of \"revolutionary\" institutions, on top of which are the Coalition, the Syrian Interim Government (SIG), the Syrian National Army (SNA), security, the judiciary and the rest of the institutions, adding that the oppositions primary role is linked to strengthening its legitimacy and trust between it and the \"revolutionary incubator\" and the identification of its strength factors, Hariri says.\n\nAs for the second trend, it is to develop the relationship and alliance with stakeholders in the solution in Syria, to limit the influence of Iran and Russia in the region and the world, considering that the alliance will be built on the basis of common interests with priority given to the \"Syrian national interest,\" according to Hariri.\n\n\"These developments exist and are discussed on the table by the opposition, but they require a clear action plan with a specific timetable to take advantage of the opportunity that most likely will not be repeated,\" Hariri asserts.\n\nDr. Khaled Khoja, the former head of the Syrian National Coalition, said in an interview with Enab Baladi that the current situation of the Syrian regime provides opportunities for the opposition to move against the Syrian regime in a way that reflects \"the will of the revolutionary street,\" but these opportunities are dependent on several factors, which are not possible to achieve.\n\nAmong the most prominent factors mentioned by Khoja is the independence of the \"revolutionary decision\" and the harmony of the political movement with the military on the ground.\n\nHe also pointed out that the countries that control the \"game\" in Syria are still determining the paths of the regime and the opposition, which does not show the indicators of achieving these two factors.\n\nSeizing the opportunity will not be at the hands of the opposition with its current components, as change requires reshaping the opposition to gain popular support and reverse the direction of pressure to become from the inside out. Khaled Khoja, The former head of the oppositions Syrian National Coalition\n\nKhoja asserts that the only opportunity can start from the Syrian street, not from the existing opposition entities, as he believes that the popular movement that the various regions of northwestern Syria have witnessed recently reflects the weight of the \"revolutionary\" street.\n\nAttempts to separate files\n\nHariri and Khoja agree that there are attempts to separate the internal files of Iran and Russia from the Syrian file, even though Russia and Iran are the two most prominent allies of the Syrian regime, and they appear in most of the files related to the Syrian reality.\n\nOne of the indications that the international community is continuing its attempts to isolate the Syrian file from the Ukrainian is the Wests resort to a policy of escalation and open and rapid support in Ukraine while resorting to a truce and calm with Russia regarding the Syrian file, according to Hariri.\n\nThe Syrian file is mainly linked to the inaction of the world and the international community to support the Syrians, which gave the Russian and Iranian intervention a greater impact on the Syrian file, Hariri considered.\n\nThe former head of the Coalition believes that the statement of the US administration at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine regarding the continuation of the disengagement agreement in Syria between the US and Russia negates the impact of the Ukrainian war on the Syrian military file from this aspect.\n\nKhoja added that the oppositions dependence on the Sochi track, which goes beyond the UN resolutions to minimize the political solution in Syria into a constitutional amendment and elections according to the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is what imposed pressure on the opposition, both political and military, and not on the regime, and that the opposition was subject to the international will which kept it away from its revolutionary incubator.",

                "cc_text": "November 2022\n\nBy Gabriela Rosa Hernndez\n\nIran has solidified its role as Russias wartime arms supplier as Russian forces, facing battlefield losses, intensify their attacks on Ukraines civilian population and infrastructure.\n\nLast summer, Iran began delivering drones that loiter, then explode on impact with a target, for Russian use in Ukraine, according to U.S. officials.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Tehran upped its involvement by agreeing to provide Moscow with surface-to-surface missiles and many additional cheap drones, Reuters reported.\n\nTwo days later, the United States disclosed that it had evidence that Iran sent personnel to Crimea to assist Russian forces in launching attacks on Ukraine. \"Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\n\nHe described the Iranian presence as \"relatively small\" and said the goal appeared to be \"to help the Russians use [drones] with better lethality\" after early failures.\n\n\"We dont believe its going to change the course of the war,\" Kirby said of Russias drone use.\n\nBut he expressed concern that Iran may go farther and transfer advanced missiles to Russia, and as a result, the United States is looking \"actively, right now\" at possibly providing Ukraine with air defense systems to deal with the Iranian threat.\n\nUkraine and its Western partners expect that Iran will send Russia the Fateh-110, a mobile short-range ballistic missile, and the Zolfaghar, a Fateh variant.\n\nThe Pentagon is trying to speed the deliveries of National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems, according to CNN. The United States has committed eight of these systems to Ukraine. Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC on Oct. 25 that his company recently delivered two of the defense systems to Ukraine and they were being installed.\n\n\"Russias use of these drones wears down Ukraines air defenses, putting stress on Ukraines supply lines and communications. Ukrainians are discussing items like the German Gepard as a successful system against these threats,\" said Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russias use of unmanned and robotic military systems.\n\nIrans sale of the missiles and drones to Russia constitutes a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which was adopted in support of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the resolution, Iran is banned from exporting ballistic missiles until 2023.\n\n\"[B]oth of the types of [drones] thatIran had been provisioning to Russia meet the parameters under [limitations contained in the resolution] because they are capable of a range equal to and greater than 300 kilometers,\" Vedant Patel, U.S. State Department principal deputy spokesperson, said on Oct. 18.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia has launched air attacks on several Ukrainian cities by using missiles, Shahed-136 loitering munitions, and Mohajer-6 drones, according to Ukrainian officials and their Western partners.\n\nTehran and Moscow have denied that Iran is supplying weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. \"The hardware that is used is Russian. It has Russian names,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to TASS on Oct. 18.\n\nThe same day, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said that claims about drone transfers are \"based on false information and spiteful assumptions [that] are part of the targeted and political propaganda campaign waged by media of some countries against\" Iran. He said Iran has been a neutral party to the war.\n\nRussian attacks on Ukraines civilian centers, including Kyiv, and vital infrastructure have been terrorizing and destructive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted on Oct 18 that, since Oct. 10, \"30 percent of Ukraines power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country. No space left for negotiations with Putins regime.\" According to the BBC, as much as 40 percent of Ukraines energy infrastructure has been damaged.\n\nResponding to the Russian attacks, Ukraine requested an array of air defense systems and support training for Ukrainian operators from Israel, Axios reported.\n\nRussia vehemently opposed such cooperation and warned that if Israel provides arms \"[i]t will destroy all diplomatic relations between our countries,\" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, wrote on Telegram on Oct. 17. Two days later, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel will help Ukraine develop an air defense alert system but not deliver weapon systems, according to CNN.",

                "cc_text": "In recent weeks, Russia has launched a campaign of targeted airstrikes against Ukraines critical civilian infrastructure as Moscow seeks to deprive Ukrainians of heating, electricity, and water ahead of the coming winter season. The Kremlin hopes to spark a humanitarian crisis and appears to believe that a new wave of Ukrainian refugees will fuel social tensions within the EU while undermining European support for Ukraine. Europe must be ready to counter Russian efforts to weaponize refugee fatigue.\n\nSince February 24, over 7.7 million Ukrainians have fled Ukraine for safety in countries across Europe, representing by far the largest European refugee crisis since the end of World War II. Ukrainian refugees have overwhelmingly experienced a warm welcome from European governments, humanitarian aid workers, and private citizens alike. Countries across Europe have rightly been commended for their efforts to help Ukrainian refugees, but as numbers have steadily grown, resources and capacity have inevitably become strained.\n\nContinued support for Ukrainian refugees will have a pronounced impact on budgets, resources, and infrastructure across Europe. The OECD estimates that Poland will spend 8.36 billion euros on Ukrainian refugees this year alone. A September UNHCR survey of Ukrainian refugees found that 68% of respondents were not yet economically active while 47% relied on assistance programs as their primary source of income.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nAccommodating such large numbers of Ukrainian refugees is placing enormous strains on existing public resources. For example, around 185,000 new Ukrainian students joined Polish primary schools at the start of the new academic year in September.\n\nA number of right-wing European politicians have already attempted to exploit mounting refugee-related concerns. So far, these efforts have largely failed to gain traction. Nevertheless, attacks on refugee accommodation and assaults on individual Ukrainian refugees highlight the potential dangers. Meanwhile, some EU citizens hosting Ukrainian refugees in their homes are beginning to ask how much longer their assistance will be required.\n\nAs energy prices skyrocket and inflation soars throughout the European Union, Ukrainians may find current programs under threat due to potential public frustration. Support may be cut as governments reconsider their spending in the face of economic crisis and as populist politicians seek scapegoats.\n\nThere are already some indications of wavering support toward Ukrainian refugees. In summer 2022, Bulgaria suspended its housing accommodation program. The Bulgarian authorities stated lack of gratitude displayed by Ukrainians as the primary decision for the shift in policy, before reinstating the program following international criticism.\n\nIn September, the leader of Germanys Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich Merz, accused Ukrainian refugees of \"welfare tourism,\" stating that refugees were taking advantage of German social services. Even Poland recently announced a change to its Ukrainian refugee policy, with refugees required to cover a part of living costs for collective accommodation.\n\nWith Russia now plotting to fuel an escalation in the refugee crisis, Western leaders need to be prepared. The worlds wealthiest countries must open their doors and their wallets to ensure that solidarity with Ukraine does not flag during the coming winter months.\n\nFirst and foremost, this means accepting more refugees. Larger countries, especially the United States, have vastly greater logistical capacity, resource flexibility, and physical space available to host Ukrainian refugees and lessen the constraints on smaller states in Central Europe.\n\nSo far, the United States has only committed to accepting up to 100,000 refugees. According to the UNHCR, France has accepted 105,000 Ukrainian refugees or just 154 for every 100,000 citizens compared to Estonias total of 60,980 Ukrainian refugees or 5,033 per 100,000 citizens. As often occurs during refugee crises, countries with lesser capacity to address the situation end up hosting the most refugees. Transatlantic partners should prove their commitment by addressing this imbalance.\n\nIt is also necessary to expand aid to countries that have accepted the most refugees per capita. At the onset of the war, humanitarian funding went only to the five countries bordering Ukraine that were originally listed in the UNHCRs Regional Refugee Response Plan. This excluded countries which accepted a comparatively large number of refugees relative to their population such as the Czech Republic and Estonia, creating greater resource divides in areas not covered by the initial aid package scenario. While the UNHCRs plan now includes other countries and transatlantic partners have provided additional funding, current levels of financial support remain insufficient.\n\nEvery refugee crisis is unique. While the moral and ethical imperatives of humanitarian assistance certainly apply in the present case, they are also joined by an ominous political calculus.

Confirmed speakers include HASC Chair Rep. ADAM SMITH (D-Wash.), Army Chief of Staff Gen. JAMES McCONVILLE, Lockheed Martin President and CEO JAMES TAICLET and Raytheon Missiles and Defense President WES KREMER. We look forward to seeing our NatSec Daily family there!\n\nSubscribe here | Email Alex | Email Matt\n\nGen. MARK MILLEY put Washington-Kyiv relations in tough spot after comments last week that the winter fighting pause could open the door to peace talks with Russia. The Biden administration has since mobilized to deliver a clear message to Ukraine: Milley didnt say what we really think.\n\nSpecifically, senior U.S. officials are telling their counterparts in Ukraine that the expected winter fighting pause doesnt mean talks should happen imminently. Instead, theyre relaying that Washington will continue to support Kyiv militarily as it launches the next phase of advances on the battlefield, Ukrainian and U.S. officials tell Alex along with LARA SELIGMAN and ERIN BANCO.\n\nThe scramble follows comments last week by Milley, the Joint Chiefs chair. The four-star general said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York that a victory by Ukraine may not be achieved militarily, and that winter may provide an opportunity to begin negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe general has spoken regularly with his Ukrainian counterpart, Gen. VALERIY ZALUZHNYY, including on Monday, according to a U.S. official. During the discussion, Zaluzhnyy did not express any concern or mention Milleys comments even once, the person said. The person, along with others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nStill, the flurry of calls and meetings with Ukrainians underscores the degree to which the administration is concerned about presenting a unified front on Ukraine and potential peace talks. Any prolonged public split among top U.S. officials could threaten the already delicate relationship between Washington and Kyiv at a key moment in the war.\n\nThe mixed messages in public and in private about whether the U.S. should begin to speak more seriously with Ukraine about peace talks with Russia are straining the Washington-Kyiv relationship, according to eight U.S. officials. While some top national security officials are adamant that now is not the time to begin discussing negotiations, especially after Kyiv retook a strategically important city last week, others believe the winter could provide an opportunity for diplomatic conversations to take place.\n\nMilleys comments echoed a broad sense inside the Defense Department that the coming winter provides a chance to discuss reaching a political settlement to end the war. Senior military officials believe Ukraine will be challenged to expel Russian forces from all occupied areas, as is Kyivs stated end goal. Thats especially the case in the Crimean peninsula, which has been held by Russia since 2014. The State Department, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork for eventual peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. The administration stresses it would only engage in such conversations alongside and in full consultation with their partners in Kyiv.\n\nThe National Security Council is the most resistant to the idea of talks, despite a smattering of aides who privately urge the U.S. to get Ukraine and Russia to the table. National security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN has occasionally agreed with their view on prioritizing Ukraine-Russia talks which is not conveyed directly to the Ukrainians but argues Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN wouldnt take negotiations seriously at this time and that the Ukrainian public would reject any efforts at dealmaking.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe Inbox\n\nBIDEN MEETS XI: President JOE BIDEN and Chinese leader XI JINPING met for three hours in Indonesia Monday to warn against Russias threatened use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine and promise to rekindle joint works on curbing climate change, per our own JONATHAN LEMIRE.\n\n\"I absolutely believe there need not be a new cold war,\" Biden told reporters after his first face-to-face meeting with Xi as the U.S. president. \"Were going to compete vigorously but were not looking for conflict. Were going to manage this competition responsibly.\"\n\n\"The world has come to a crossroads [and] we need to chart the right course,\" said Xi, whose words were translated into English. \"The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.\"\n\nThe bonhomie betrayed the simmering concerns over Taiwans future, as fears that China plans a forceful takeover of the democratically ruled island grow in Washington. Biden, however, tried to tamp down tensions, saying \"I do not think theres any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.\"\n\nROBERT DALY, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, dismissed Mondays meeting as \"a non-event.\"\n\n\"I dont see any sign that either country is willing to change its assessment of the other, its intentions or its goals. So theres a desire to understand [each other] which is good, but theres no indication that either country is yet ready to reconsider any of its positions,\" Daly said.\n\nTAKE IT EASY: Senior Indonesian politicians are calling on Western leaders to make concessions on criticizing Russia over the war in Ukraine in a last-ditch effort to avoid leaving the G-20 summit without a joint declaration, our own STUART LAU reported Sunday, citing three diplomats with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations.\n\nU.S., European, Australian, Canadian and Japanese officials are among those under pressure from Indonesian counterparts, all the way up to President JOKO WIDODO, to show \"flexibility\" and consider using less tough rhetoric in order for Moscow, the diplomats said.\n\nWidodo \"considers it a personal success\" if a G-20 declaration could be reached, one of the officials said, adding that the Indonesian leader has lamented repeatedly that he is chairing the \"most difficult\" G-20 summit ever. He is also hoping to avoid kicking Russia out and making it the G-19, which the G-8 did in the wake of Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea in 2014.\n\nWhat else should you be watching for at the G-20? Our own NAHAL TOOSI has the rundown.\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY BLINKEN TO QATAR: Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN is expected to attend a World Cup game in Qatar during the early days of the tournament. And by what were sure is sheer coincidence, hell also hold discussions with Qatari leaders as part of an ongoing strategic dialogue with the Middle Eastern ally, Nahal reports.\n\nBlinken is planning to attend the U.S. game against Wales on Nov. 21, according to a U.S. official familiar with the issue. The strategic dialogue session will take place the same day, a former U.S. official familiar with contacts inside the State Department said.\n\nA State spokesperson said there were no travel plans to announce. The three people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to go on the record and to describe sensitive conversations.\n\nUnclear still is who from the Biden administration will attend the closing ceremony, an important moment as it involves a symbolic handoff to the United States, which will co-host the next World Cup. Biden, however, is not expected to attend any of the Qatar event.\n\nBlinken and his colleagues have promised to put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy. The World Cup in Qatar has brought human rights to the fore as migrant workers have died building stadiums and the country forbids homosexuality.\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY GROUPS CALL FOR U.S.-SAUDI SHAKE UP: Nine progressive and antiwar organizations are calling on Democratic leadership to reexamine the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship after the Riyadh and Moscow-led OPEC+ decision to cut oil production.\n\n\"The United States cannot allow petro-dictator leverage over energy markets to set the course of international politics,\" the groups, including Win Without War, Human Rights Watch and the Sunrise Movement, wrote to Sen. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.) and Speaker of the House NANCY PELOSI.\n\nThe organizations urge the lawmakers to bring up legislation for debate that halts direct commercial and military sales for one year, protects dissidents and speeds up the renewable energy transitions.\n\nAFGHAN FAMILY REUNIFICATION: The State Department announced the launch of a landing page to help Afghan families in the United States reunite with their loved ones. The website provides guides and links on how best to apply for status in the U.S. or bring a family member stateside.\n\nMore than 1,550 Afghan children came to the U.S. without their parents during evacuation efforts in Kabul last year.

I WAYAN KOSTER said Lavrov was taken to the islands biggest hospital \"for a health checkup\" and left \"in good condition.\" Two officials had previously told the AP that the foreign minister sought treatment for a heart condition.\n\nMoscow, however, has a different view of the visit that it didnt happen at all. Reports of the hospital visit are \"the highest level of fakes,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson MARIA ZAKHAROVA said in a statement.\n\nZakharova posted a video of Lavrov, appearing healthy and wearing a T-shirt and shorts, responding to the reports of his hospitalization: \"Theyve been writing about our president for 10 years that hes fallen ill. Its a game that is not new in politics,\" Lavrov said in the video.\n\nJAPAN RETHINKS MILITARY DEPENDENCY: Japan has relied mainly on the United States for its security and protection since the end of World War II. Thats starting to change as threats in the Indo-Pacific and Russias invasion of Ukraine changes the calculus in Tokyo.\n\n\"The countrys governing party is pushing to increase Japans defense budget drastically, develop more military hardware domestically and redefine what it can do with those weapons under the pacifist constitution in place since the end of World War II,\" The New York Times MOTOKO RICH and HIKARI HIDA report.\n\nSuch a shift requires deft diplomacy as it could scare China and regional countries that Japan will once again run roughshod in East Asia. But any concerns likely wont change Tokyos current trajectory.\n\n\"We have to fortify our defenses in order to fortify the alliance,\" ICHIRO FUJISAKI, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, told the NYT. \"We cant let the Americans do everything, and we have to do more on our own.\"\n\nRead: Alex at his last job did a deep dive into Japans changing views on its military.\n\nKeystrokes\n\nSNEAKY SOFTWARE: Computer code developed by Pushwoosh, a Russian technology company, was found in CDC and Army software after being disguised as American, Reuters JAMES PEARSON and MARISA TAYLOR reports.\n\nThe CDC removed the software from seven apps after the health agency was deceived into believing the tech company was based D.C.. The Army removed the app in March after noting similar concerns after an app that featured the software was used by troops for training.\n\nPushwoosh claims to be an American company in U.S. regulatory filings, with headquarters in California, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The apps code is embedded in nearly 8,000 apps in Apple and Googles app stores.\n\nThe Russian companys business with the U.S. government and private companies could violate Federal Trade Commission laws or trigger sanctions, according to experts.\n\nThe Complex\n\nWE MEET AGAIN: The Ukraine Defense Contact Group will meet again virtually on Wednesday, where speeding the delivery of additional air defense systems is likely to be high on the agenda, our friends over at Morning Defense (for Pros!) report.\n\nThe 50-nation forum last month orchestrated the approval of HAWK anti-aircraft systems from Spain, along with U.S. stores of missiles for the launchers. But Kyiv needs all it can get as Russia continues to target civilian infrastructure with cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones. Last week, the Pentagon agreed to send Avenger short-range air-defense batteries.\n\nKyiv is also seeking more equipment to see it through the winter, including tanks, a steady supply of artillery shells and cold weather gear.\n\nOn the Hill\n\nWILL THEY WONT THEY: Congress returns today with just weeks to pass a final NDAA for the current fiscal year, but its not a lock that the Senate will be able to pass its own version, our friends over at Morning Defense also reports.\n\nThe House passed its defense bill in July, but the Senate has not yet done so. The Senate last month teed up an updated version of its bill with 75 amendments for a total of $847 billion authorizing $45 billion more than Biden sought.\n\nBut the bill faces a big obstacle: Majority Leader Schumer is weighing pulling the NDAA to instead focus on confirming nominees, Bloomberg reported. A congressional aide familiar with the process also told our own CONNOR OBRIEN last week that shelving a vote on the bill is on the table, but no decision had been made.\n\nIf the Senate punts, it would be the second year the chamber hasnt passed a bill of its own. A deadlock over amendments forced Democrats to yank the bill from the floor last year and go directly to negotiations with the House on a final bill.\n\nBroadsides\n\nWAR HAWKS ATTACK PUTIN: Russian pro-war activists have amped up their criticism of the militarys performance following their withdrawal from Kherson last week, The New York Times NEIL MACFARQUHAR reports.\n\nALEKSANDR DUGIN, a right-wing commentator in Russia, criticized the military on social and questioned whether the annexation referendum votes were legitimate due to the large crowds that welcomed Ukrainian soldiers after the region was liberated. Russia, illegally and with no evidence, declared that it had annexed Kherson in September but never fully controlled the area.\n\nAlthough Russian state media claims the withdrawal from Kherson is temporary, critics like Wagner Group leader YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN have called out generals to criticize military tactics and advocate for even greater violence.\n\nWhile some critics have directed their ire at military leaders, others have attributed Russias shortcomings on the battlefield to Putin.\n\n\"His decisions are not up for discussion,\" an editorial in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper. \"Therefore, he himself cannot make mistakes because there is no mechanism to correct them. A leader who admits a mistake lowers his status, which puts his qualities into doubt.\"\n\nTransitions\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY: SHANA MANSBACH is now speechwriter and senior adviser to Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN at the State Department.

Ukrainian air defense destroyed some of the drones, but others hit targets. The Russian forces also used drones in an attack on the city of Dnipro, targeting a logistics enterprise. Reznichenko said four employees were wounded, and three of them are in serious condition in hospital.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nRussian forces also bombarded the Nikopol district in the region with Grad missiles and heavy artillery. Reznichenko said the shelling damaged private houses, a factory, and a power line, but no one was injured.\n\nA fire spread over more than 3,000 square meters but was extinguished, Reznichenko said.\n\nRussian troops regularly shell the Dnipropetrovsk region with various types of weapons, in particular the Nikopol, Kryvorizky, and Synelnyk districts.\n\nIn Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed Ukraine will not \"surrender a single centimeter of our land\" in Donetsk, and he thanked Ukrainian troops who are holding positions in the Donbas region.\n\nThe epicenter of the battle for the industrial region of Donetsk is around the towns of Bakhmut, Soledar, and Avdiyivka.\n\n\"The activity of the occupiers remains at an extremely high level -- dozens of attacks every day,\" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address late on November 8.\n\n\"They are suffering extraordinarily high losses. But the order remains the same: to advance on the administrative boundary of Donetsk region. We will not yield a single centimeter of our land,\" he said.\n\nDonetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions Russia said it annexed in September following referendums considered a sham by Kyiv and its Western allies.\n\nFighting has taken place there between Ukrainian military and Kremlin-backed separatist forces since 2014, the same year Russia illegally annexed Crimea in the south.\n\nZelenskiy said the goal of the Russian troops is to push to the administrative border of the Donetsk region.\n\n\"We clearly understand the enemy's plans, so we act accordingly: carefully, thoughtfully, and in the interests of the liberation of our entire territory. We are strengthening our positions, breaking Russian logistics, and consistently destroying the potential of the occupiers to keep the south of our country under occupation,\" Zelenskiy added.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said the most intense battles were taking place in Bakhmut and Soledar where the Ukrainian military repels dozens of Russian attacks per day.\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the region's military administration, said the city of Bakhmut was badly damaged, and there is not a single surviving house in Avdiyivka, Maryinka, or Krasnohorivka. Russian troops are trying to wipe the cities \"off the face of the Earth,\" he said.\n\nFierce fighting was also going on on the edge of the town of Snihurivka, in the southern Mykolayiv region, according to Yury Barabashov, the town's Russian-appointed mayor, as cited by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the southern Kherson region, said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had tried to advance on three fronts, including Snihurivka.\n\nVitaly Kim, the Ukrainian governor of the Mykolayiv region, apparently quoting an intercepted dialogue between Russian troops, suggested Ukrainian forces had already pushed the Russians out of the area.\n\n\"Russian troops are complaining that they have already been thrown out of there,\" Kim said in a statement on his Telegram channel.\n\nThe information could not be independently verified.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it destroyed two Russian ammunition depots in southern Ukraine on November 8, one in Snihurivka, and one in Kostromka, in the neighboring Kherson region.\n\nWATCH: Paratroopers with Ukraine's 79th Air Assault Brigade say they're holding positions around the small city of Maryinka in eastern Ukraine despite daily Russian attacks.\n\nRussia has mobilized hundreds of thousands of reservists in recent months seeking to stave off an offensive launched by Ukraine to regain Russian-occupied territories.\n\nKyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said on November 8 that 21 Russian conscripts had surrendered to Ukrainian forces around Svatove in the eastern Luhansk region.\n\n\"These poor mobilized men -- really poor, they had had nothing to eat or drink in three days -- of course they decided to surrender,\" Zhdanov said on his YouTube channel.\n\nIn the southern Kherson region, a battle between advancing Ukrainian forces and the Russian occupiers has been looming for weeks in the city by the same name, the only regional capital Russia has captured intact since its unprovoked invasion in February.\n\nKherson is arguably the most important of the four partially occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia says it annexed. It controls both the only land route to the Crimean Peninsula and the mouth of the Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine.\n\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also commented on the fighting in eastern Ukraine on November 8. He was quoted by TASS as saying that information released about casualties among Chechen fighters near Lysychansk, a city in the eastern Luhansk region, was false.\n\n\"Not a single fighter of ours was killed in the aforementioned area,\" Kadyrov wrote on his Telegram channel, adding that he didn't want to comment on \"such falsehoods\" but found it necessary \"to reassure all sane and concerned people.\"\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, released video footage that it said showed a drone strike obliterating a Ukrainian tank that was hiding in an urban area and shelling Russian troops.\n\n\"A Russian squad of unmanned aerial vehicles spotted the Ukrainian tank and destroyed it using a precision strike,\" the ministry said on November 8, according to TASS.\n\nThe Ukrainian military's General Staff said Russian troops used drones and artillery on November 8 to shell communities along the Sumy region's border with Russia in northeastern Ukraine. The only damage reported was to utility poles.\n\nSumy borders three regions of Russia: Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod. The border regions of Ukraine are regularly shelled by Russia.\n\nNeither side's battlefield claims could be independently verified.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has accused Russian troops of more looting and destroying infrastructure in Kherson.\n\n\"A convoy of trucks passed over the dam of the Kakhova hydroelectric station loaded with home appliances and building materials,\" the military said.\n\nRussians were dismantling mobile phone towers and taking equipment, it said, adding that near the city of Beryslav, Russian forces \"blew up a power line and took equipment from a solar power station.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AP, and CNN",

                "cc_text": "Top Diplomats of South Korea, Japan and China Meet to Restart Trilateral Summit, Revive Cooperation\n\nThe top diplomats from South Korea, Japan and China met Sunday to discuss when to resume their leaders trilateral summit after a four-year hiatus and how to strengthen cooperation among the three Northeast Asian neighbors, The Associated Press said on Sunday.\n\nClosely linked economically and culturally with one another, the three countries together account for about 25% of the global gross domestic product. But efforts to boost trilateral cooperation have often hit a snag because of a mix of issues including historical disputes stemming from Japans wartime aggression and the strategic competition between China and the United States.\n\nMeeting in the southeastern South Korean city of Busan, the foreign ministers of the three countries were to exchange opinions on preparations to restart the trilateral summit, ways to improve three-way cooperation and other regional and international issues, according to Seouls Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn September, senior officials of the three nations agreed to restart the trilateral summit \"at the earliest convenient time.\"\n\nSince they held their first stand-alone, trilateral summit in 2008, the leaders of the three countries had been supposed to meet annually. But their summit has faced on-again, off-again suspensions and remains stalled since 2019.\n\nTheir relationships are intertwined with a slew of complicated, touchy issues.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan are key US military allies, hosting a total of 80,000 American troops on their territories. Their recent push to beef up a trilateral security cooperation with the United States has angered China, which is extremely sensitive to any moves it perceives as seeking to contain its rise to dominance in Asia.\n\nBut some observers say that the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden struck a conciliatory tone in their first face-to-face meeting in a year earlier this month would provide Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing with diplomatic rooms to maneuver to find ways to revive three-way cooperation.\n\n\"As the international society is at a historic turning point as it faces major challenges and changes, we hope to discuss our strategic significance of Japan-China-South Korea cooperation,\" Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters Friday.\n\nJapanese officials said Sunday's foreign ministers' meeting would discuss North Korea's recent spy satellite launch and the Russian-Ukraine war as well as a resumption of the trilateral summit. The officials said that no joint statement was expected after the meeting.\n\nThe three ministers held bilateral talks on the sidelines.\n\nAfter her meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday, Kamikawa said she renewed Japan's demand that China remove its ban on seafood imports from Japan in response to Tokyo's discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from its tsunami-hit nuclear power plant. Wang, for his part, said China opposed Japan's \"irresponsible action\" of releasing the wastewater and called for an independent monitoring mechanism of the process, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\nTies between South Korea and Japan deteriorated severely in past years due to issues originating from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. But their relations have warmed significantly in recent months as the two countries took a series of major steps to move beyond history wrangling and boost bilateral cooperation in the face of North Korea's evolving nuclear threats and other shared challenges.\n\nIn a reminder of their difficult relations, however, a Seoul court earlier this week ordered Japan to financially compensate Koreans forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops during the colonial period. Kamikawa called the court verdict \"extremely regrettable\" and \"absolutely unacceptable,\" saying it violates international law and past bilateral agreements.\n\nDuring their bilateral meeting Sunday, Kamikawa and her South Korean counterpart Park Jin discussed the court ruling, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement without elaborating. The ministry also said the two ministers strongly condemned the North's latest spy satellite launch and agreed to work together to reinvigorate a three-way cooperation involving China.\n\nMeeting Wang bilaterally, Park asked for China to play a constructive role in persuading North Korea to halt provocations and take steps toward denuclearization, according to South Korean media.\n\nNorth Korea's growing arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles poses a major security threat to South Korea and Japan. But China, North Korea's last major ally and biggest source of aid, is suspected of avoiding fully enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea and shipping clandestine assistance to the North to help its impoverished neighbor stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against US influences on the Korean Peninsula.",

Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON The United States on Wednesday accused North Korea of covertly shipping a \"significant number\" of artillery shells to Russia to aid its war effort in Ukraine, a sign that Moscow is increasingly turning to pariah states for military supplies as the grinding conflict persists.\n\nThe White Houses national security spokesman, John Kirby, said that it was unclear if the artillery munitions, which are being transferred through the Middle East and North Africa, had reached Russia. The United States does not believe that the additional weapons will alter the trajectory of the war.\n\n\"Our indications are the DPRK is covertly supplying and were going to monitor to see whether shipments are received,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"Our information indicates that theyre trying to obscure the method of supply by funneling them through other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\"\n\nNorth Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so.\n\nThe Biden administration said in September that Russia was seeking to purchase artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The United States is also concerned that Iran may be shipping drones and surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nMr. Kirby said that Russia had now gone beyond shopping for such artillery and had made purchases. He would not elaborate on how the weapons were being transported or whether the United States intends to try to intercept them.\n\nThe United States believes that Ukraine will continue to have the ability to defend itself if the North Korean munitions do reach Russia.\n\n\"We dont we dont believe that this will change the course of the war,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nThe State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the United States would use \"every tool\" to enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, and would \"look at additional tools and authorities that we may be able to call upon to counter this activity.\"\n\nHe also urged nations that have relations with North Korea to pressure its government not to provide weapons to Russia.\n\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "After Russias invasion of Ukraine in February, the Russian economy seemed destined for a nosedive. International sanctions threatened to strangle the economy, leading to a plunge in the value of the ruble and Russian financial markets. Everyday Russians appeared poised for privation.\n\nMore than eight months into the war, this scenario has not come to pass. Indeed, some data suggest that the opposite is true, and the Russian economy is doing fine. The ruble has strengthened against the dollar, and although Russian GDP has shrunk, the contraction may well be limited to less than three percent in 2022.\n\nLook behind the moderate GDP contraction and inflation figures, however, and it becomes evident that the damage is in fact severe: the Russian economy is destined for a long period of stagnation. The state was already interfering in the private sector before the war. That tendency has become only more pronounced, and it threatens to further stifle innovation and market efficiency. The only way to preserve the viability of the Russian economy is through either major reformswhich are not in the offingor an institutional disruption similar to the one that occurred with the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nSanctions Are Not Missiles\n\nThe misapprehension of what sanctions against Russia would accomplish can be explained in part by unrealistic expectations of what economic measures can do. Simply put, they are not the equivalent of a missile strike. Yes, in the long run, sanctions can weaken the economy and lower GDP. But in the short run, the most one can reasonably hope for is a massive fall in Russias imports. It is only natural that the ruble strengthens rather than weakens as the demand for dollars and euros drops. And as the money that would have been spent on imports is redirected toward domestic production, GDP should in fact rise rather than fall. The effect of sanctions on consumption and quality of life take longer to work their way through the economy.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, in February and early March, Russians rushed to buy dollars and euros to protect themselves against a potential plunge in the ruble. Over the next eight months, with Russian losses in Ukraine mounting, they bought even more. Normally, this would have caused a significant devaluation of the ruble because when people buy foreign currency, the ruble plunges. Because of sanctions, however, companies that imported goods before the war stopped purchasing currency to finance these imports. As a result, imports fell by 40 percent in the spring. One consequence was that the ruble strengthened against the dollar. In short, it was not that sanctions did not work. On the contrary, their short-term effect on imports was unexpectedly strong. Such a fall in imports was not expected. If Russias central bank had anticipated such a massive fall, it would not have introduced severe restrictions on dollar deposits in March to prevent a collapse in the value of the ruble.\n\nEconomic sanctions did, of course, have other immediate effects. Curbing Russias access to microelectronics, chips, and semiconductors made production of cars and aircraft almost impossible. From March to August, Russian car manufacturing fell by an astonishing 90 percent, and the drop in aircraft production was similar. The same holds true for the production of weapons, which is understandably a top priority for the government. Expectations that new trade routes through China, Turkey, and other countries that are not part of the sanctions regime would compensate for the loss of Western imports have been proved wrong. The abnormally strong ruble is a signal that backdoor import channels are not working. If imports were flowing into Russia through hidden channels, importers would have been buying dollars, sending the ruble down. Without these critical imports, the long-term health of Russias high-tech industry is dire.\n\nThe Russian economy is destined for a long period of stagnation.\n\nEven more consequential than Western technology sanctions is the fact that Russia is unmistakably entering a period in which political cronies are solidifying their hold on the private sector. This has been a long time in the making. After the 2008 global financial crisis hit Russia harder than any other G-20 country, Russian President Vladimir Putin essentially nationalized large enterprises. In some cases, he placed them under direct government control; in other cases, he placed them under the purview of state banks. To stay in the governments good graces, these companies have been expected to maintain a surplus of workers on their payrolls. Even enterprises that remained private have in essence been prohibited from firing employees. This has provided the Russian people with economic securityat least for the time beingand that stability is a critical part of Putins compact with his constituents. But an economy in which enterprises cannot modernize, restructure, and fire employees to boost profits will stagnate. Not surprisingly, Russias GDP growth from 2009 to 2021 averaged 0.8 percent per year, lower than the period in the 1970s and 1980s that preceded the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nEven before the war, Russian businesses faced regulations that deprived them of investment. Advanced industries such as energy, transportation, and communicationthat is, those that would have benefited the most from foreign technology and foreign investmentfaced the greatest restrictions. To survive, companies operating in this space were forced to maintain close ties with government officials and bureaucrats. In exchange, these government protectors ensured that these businesses faced no competition. They outlawed foreign investment, passed laws that put onerous burdens on foreigners doing business in Russia, and opened investigations against companies operating without government protection. The result was that government officials, military generals, and high-ranking bureaucratsmany of them Putins friendsbecame multimillionaires. The living standards of ordinary Russians, in contrast, have not improved in the past decade.\n\nSince the beginning of the war, the government has tightened its grip on the private sector even further. Starting in March, the Kremlin rolled out laws and regulations that give the government the right to shut down businesses, dictate production decisions, and set prices for manufactured goods. The mass mobilization of military recruits that started in September is providing Putin with another cudgel to wield over Russian businesses because to preserve their workforces, company leaders will need to bargain with government officials to ensure that their employees are exempt from conscription.\n\nTo be sure, the Russian economy has long operated under a government stranglehold. But Putins most recent moves are taking this control to a new level. As the economists Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny have argued, the one thing worse than corruption is decentralized corruption. Its bad enough when a corrupt central government demands bribes; it is even worse when several different government offices are competing for handouts. Indeed, the high growth rates of Putins first decade in office were in part due to how he centralized power in the Kremlin, snuffing out competing predators such as oligarchs operating outside the governments fold. The emphasis on creating private armies and regional volunteer battalions for his war against Ukraine, however, is creating new power centers. That means that decentralized corruption will almost certainly resurface in Russia.\n\nThat could create a dynamic reminiscent of the 1990s, when Russian business owners relied on private security, mafia ties, and corrupt officials to maintain control of newly privatized enterprises. Criminal gangs employing veterans of the Russian war in Afghanistan offered \"protection\" to the highest bidder or simply plundered profitable businesses. The mercenary groups that Putin created to fight in Ukraine will play the same role in the future.\n\nA Long Road Ahead\n\nRussia could still eke out a victory in Ukraine. Its unclear what winning would look like; perhaps permanent occupation of a few ruined Ukrainian cities would be packaged as a triumph. Alternatively, Russia could lose the war, an outcome that would make it more likely that Putin would lose power. A new reformist government could take over and withdraw troops, consider reparations, and negotiate a lifting of trade sanctions.\n\nNo matter the outcome, however, Russia will emerge from the war with its government exercising authority over the private sector to an extent that is unprecedented anywhere in the world aside from Cuba and North Korea. The Russian government will be omnipresent yet simultaneously not strong enough to protect businesses from mafia groups consisting of demobilized soldiers armed with weapons they acquired during the war. Particularly at first, they will target the most profitable enterprises, both at the national and local level.\n\nFor the Russian economy to grow, it will need not only major institutional reforms but also the kind of clean slate that Russia was left with in 1991. The collapse of the Soviet state made institutions of that era irrelevant. A long and painful process of building new institutions, increasing state capacity, and reducing corruption followeduntil Putin came to power and eventually dismantled market institutions and built his own system of patronage. The lesson is grim: even if Putin loses power and a successor ushers in significant reforms, it will take at least a decade for Russia to return to the levels of private-sector production and quality of life the country experienced just a year ago. Such are the consequences of a disastrous, misguided war.",

                "cc_text": "Preamble\n\nWe, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, underline our strong sense of unity and our unshakable commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to protect the rights of all, including the most vulnerable.\n\nAll Members of the United Nations must refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any state in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Violations of universally agreed and legally binding fundamental principles such as peaceful cooperation, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial integrity are unacceptable. We are clear in our commitment to hold those responsible for egregious violations of such basic principles of international law to account.\n\n1. Russias war against Ukraine\n\nWe again call on Russia to immediately stop its war of aggression against Ukraine and withdraw all of its forces and military equipment. Together with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba we condemn Russias recent escalation, including its attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, across Ukraine using missiles and Iranian drones and trainers. Through these attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. Indiscriminate attacks against civilian population and infrastructure constitute war crimes and we reiterate our determination to ensure full accountability for these and crimes against humanity. We also condemn the violation of Moldovan airspace.\n\nRussias irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable. Any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We also reject Russias false claims that Ukraine is preparing a radiological \"dirty bomb\". The inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that these allegations are baseless, and we commend Ukraine for its transparency.\n\nWe also condemn Russias continued seizure and militarization of Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and the willful destabilization of its operations. We support the IAEAs efforts to establish a Safety and Security Zone.\n\nWe will continue to impose economic costs on Russia and on other countries, individuals or entities providing military support for Moscows war of aggression, as several of us have already done regarding Irans provision of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Russia.\n\nWe reiterate our call for the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling Russias war of aggression, including permitting Russias armed forces to use Belarusian territory to launch missiles targeting Ukraine. If the Belarusian authorities more directly involve Belarus in Russias war, the G7 will impose overwhelming additional costs on the regime.\n\nWe reiterate our unwavering commitment to continue providing the financial, humanitarian, defense, political, technical, and legal support Ukraine needs to alleviate the suffering of its people and to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. We salute the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russias unprovoked aggression, and we are committed to helping Ukraine meet its winter preparedness needs.\n\nToday we establish a G7 coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. We look forward to the 13 December international conference in Paris aimed at supporting Ukraines civilian resilience, organized by France and Ukraine. We also welcome the outcomes of the 25 October International Experts Conference in Berlin and remain committed to contribute to the recovery, reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine. We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nWe reaffirm our support for press freedom and access to reliable information globally. We will continue to counter Russias disinformation, including false allegations concerning bioweapons. We are strengthening the G7 Rapid Response Mechanisms capacity for a coordinated response.\n\nRecalling the 11 October G7 Leaders statement, we welcome President Zelenskyys readiness for a just peace based on respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty, and its legitimate right to defend itself from aggression. Russias calls for negotiations are not credible when it continues to escalate the war and issue new threats and disinformation.\n\n2. Global consequences of Russias war against Ukraine\n\nRussias war of aggression is a driver of the most severe global food and energy crises in recent history. We condemn Russias attempts to leverage energy and food exports as a tool of geopolitical coercion. The resulting turmoil is hitting vulnerable countries and communities around the world particularly hard, exacerbating an already dire situation caused by the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and existing conflicts. We will continue to coordinate among the G7 and beyond to help mitigate the consequences of Russias war of aggression on global economic stability and international food, nutrition and energy security by both addressing acute needs and making medium to long term investments in resilient systems.\n\nWe strongly support the United Nations Secretary-Generals call for the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), which has reduced global food prices. We urge Russia to heed the Secretary-Generals call. The G7 is also leading other vital international initiatives, including the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) and the EU-led Solidarity Lanes. We are also accelerating our work to get fertilizers to the most vulnerable. We commit to promote more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems globally and call on the G20 to support these efforts.\n\nWe continue to encourage oil-producing countries to increase production, which will decrease volatility in energy markets. We will finalize implementation of the price cap on seaborne Russian oil in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Global issues\n\nWe reaffirm the need to strengthen and modernize the United Nations, with a view to making it more effective in the face of mounting global challenges, and we express our support for the vision of the UN Secretary-Generals Our Common Agenda.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts for a more secure, more stable and safer world. We are strengthening export controls, including through international export control regimes, on materials, technology and research that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. In this context, we support Indias early entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n\nWe will also continue to enhance our coordination and cooperation, within and beyond the G7, including on economic security challenges, and we will stand up to acts of economic coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm our intention to increase debt transparency and find solutions to debt vulnerabilities, especially by ensuring the swift delivery of results through the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).\n\nUnderscoring a geostrategic and global approach to connectivity, we renew our commitment to implement the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), including by mobilizing up to 600 billion US-Dollars in public and private investments over the next five years.\n\n4. Iran\n\nWe, the G7 members, express our support for the fundamental aspiration of the people of Iran for a future where human security and their universal human rights are respected and protected. We condemn the violent death of the young Iranian woman \"Jina\" Mahsa Amini after her arrest by Irans so called \"morality police.\" We further condemn the brutal and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters and children. We urge Iranian authorities to honor their international obligations under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nWe advocate the right of all Iranians to access information, and we deplore the Iranian governments erosion of civil space, and independent journalism, its targeting of human rights defenders, including by shutting down the internet and social media. We urge the Iranian authorities to treat women as equal, respecting the universal rights provided to them under the relevant international human rights treaties. We also call on the Iranian authorities to release unjustly detained prisoners, including recently arrested protesters, children, journalists and human rights defenders, and ensure accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses. We will continue to use all available diplomatic measures to hold the Iranian authorities to account. We call on Iran to allow access to the country for relevant UN Human Rights Special Procedures mandate holders.\n\nWe strongly reject Irans practice of unfairly detaining dual and foreign citizens and call upon Iran to end the repellent practice of such unjust detentions in hopes of political gain.\n\nWe strongly support international efforts to hold Iran to account for its downing of PS752, which killed 176 innocent civilians. We demand that Iran fulfill its international legal obligations without delay.\n\nWe strongly condemn Irans continued destabilizing activities in and around the Middle East. These include Irans activities with both ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, and transfers of such advanced weaponry to state and non-state actors. Such proliferation is destabilizing for the region and escalates already high tensions. We urge Iran to cease its support to violent state and non-state actors and proxy groups and fully abide by all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), including UNSCR 2231. We also support efforts at the United Nations to hold Russia and Iran accountable for their blatant violations of UNSCR 2231.\n\nWe reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. The G7 will continue working together, and with other international partners, to address Irans nuclear escalation and insufficient cooperation with the IAEA regarding its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) safeguards agreement. We remain deeply concerned by the unabated expansion of Irans nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification. We call on Iran to change course and fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments in the field of nuclear non-proliferation without further delay. We note that despite many months of intense negotiations on a return to the JCPoA, Iran has not made the necessary decisions.\n\n5. Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n\nWe, the G7 members, strongly condemn the unprecedented series of unlawful ballistic missile launches conducted by the DPRK in 2022, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the intermediate-range ballistic missile launch on 4 October 2022, which was recklessly launched over Japan. These launches demonstrate the DPRKs continued efforts to expand its ballistic missile capabilities and are flagrant violations of multiple UNSCRs.\n\nWe reiterate our demand that the DPRK abandon its nuclear weapons, existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, in accordance with all relevant UNSCRs. We urge the DPRK to immediately halt its destabilizing activity, fully abide with all legal obligations under the relevant UNSCRs, and fully comply with the NPT and IAEA safeguards.\n\nAny nuclear test or other reckless action must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. We call on all states to fully and effectively implement all UNSCRs and vigilantly monitor, prevent, and penalize sanctions evading activities. We call on the DPRK to cease further escalation and engage in meaningful diplomacy concerning its unlawful nuclear and ballistic programs. We remain committed to working with all relevant partners toward the goal of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and upholding the rules-based international order.\n\nWe commend the work of the UNSC 1718 Committee, which has swiftly approved all COVID-19 related sanctions exemption requests for humanitarian assistance for the DPRK. We call on the DPRK to allow the re-establishment of UN and diplomatic access, in line with appropriate and reasonable COVID-19 regulations. We continue to condemn the DPRKs systematic widespread and gross human rights violations and abuses and urge the DPRK to cooperate with all relevant UN bodies and to resolve the abductions issue immediately. We remain gravely concerned regarding the humanitarian situation in the DPRK, which is the result of the DPRKs choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of its own people.\n\n6. Indo-Pacific\n\nWe, the G7 members, reiterate the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and based on the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, transparency, territorial integrity, and the peaceful and inclusive resolution of disputes. We are committed to protecting and promoting the rules-based international order, improving regional connectivity, strengthening free and fair trade, enhancing national resilience, supporting inclusive economic growth, promoting global health security, as well as confronting the climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity. We reaffirm our intention to work together with countries in the region and our support for the unity and centrality of ASEAN and commit to explore concrete cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).\n\n7. East and South China Seas\n\nWe remain seriously concerned about the situation in and around the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any moves that increase tensions and undermine regional stability and the rules-based international order. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and reaffirm UNCLOS important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, legally binding upon the parties, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes. We reaffirm the need to uphold the principle of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\n8. China\n\nWe, the G7 members, aim for constructive cooperation with China, where possible and in our interest, in particular on global challenges like peace and security, global health, the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources. These challenges can only be tackled successfully through cooperation within the rules-based international order.\n\nWe remind China of the need to uphold the principles of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes and to abstain from threats, coercion, intimidation, or the use of force. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic positions of G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies.\n\nWe will continue to raise our concerns with China on its reported human rights violations and abuses, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We reiterate our concerns over the continued erosion of Hong Kongs rights, freedoms and autonomy, and call on China to act in accordance with its international commitments and legal obligations.\n\nWe also call on China to treat foreign diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n\n9. Central Asia\n\nWe, the G7 members, discussed the multiple challenges facing the five Central Asian countries, ranging from the economic and geopolitical consequences of Russias war of aggression against Ukraine, to regional security issues and disputes, to climate change. We are committed to strengthening our cooperation with Central Asian countries and working with their governments and people on socio-economic development, respect for human rights, implementation of domestic and institutional reforms, as well as regional security. We will also work together to foster connectivity, transportation, and trade links.\n\n10. Africa\n\nWe, the G7 members, underscore the geopolitical and strategic importance of the African continent. Close cooperation with our African partners remains vital. Africa is particularly affected by multiple global crises such as the climate crisis, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition, energy insecurity, the socio-economic consequences of Russias war against Ukraine, democratic backsliding, and massive global economic headwinds. Our cooperation with and support for Africa are guided by the objectives of the AU Agenda 2063, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the principles of the UN Charter. We will continue to work with our African partners to build resilient and sustainable agri-food and energy systems, mitigate climate change, and address disinformation.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in quality infrastructure in Africa based on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, including through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We will continue to support regional manufacturing capacity for vaccines and other essential medical products supported by sustainable markets.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing deterioration of the political, security and humanitarian situation, including humanitarian access, in the Sahel. We are appalled by the violations and abuses of human rights against civilian populations, including those committed by terrorist groups and the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces in Mali. We call for accountability of all those responsible for human rights violations or abuses. We express our concern over the growing presence of Russian affiliated forces in Mali and elsewhere on the continent and their potentially destabilizing impact. We call for timely preparation of free and fair elections and comprehensive implementation of the transition charters in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, and reaffirm our support to the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union in this regard. We condemn the violence against protestors in Chad and the failure of that transitional government to adhere to African Union principles and communiques. We reiterate our strong commitment to support the populations of the Sahel countries, especially youth, and emphasize the need to work with people and governments of the littoral states in the Gulf of Guinea to strengthen their resilience to the threat of terrorism in a comprehensive way.\n\nWe remain concerned about peace and security in the Horn of Africa and the acute humanitarian needs, including famine in Somalia, and which disproportionally impact women and girls. We will work with the countries, institutions and civil society in the region to address these challenges. We welcome the announcement of the agreement reached by the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) brokered by the African Union, South Africa and Kenya, to settle the conflict in northern Ethiopia. We urge the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF to fully honor and implement this commitment. Human rights violations, atrocities and abuses must cease immediately. Perpetrators of these violations and abuses must be held to account; survivors and victims must obtain justice.\n\nWe commend Somalia on the election of a new government and call for a concerted international effort to support President Hassan Sheikh Mohamuds reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We firmly condemn the heinous attack by al-Shabaab on civilians on 29 October and express our heart-felt condolences to the families of the victims. More than one year after the military takeover in Sudan, we continue to urge the military to respect the commitment they made to withdraw from politics and maintain our call for a return to a civilian-led government based on broad support from the Sudanese people.\n\nWe are increasingly concerned by the ongoing, escalating violence and conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as well as regional tensions in the Great Lakes. We urge restraint by the M23 armed movement and call for a cessation of its current offensive. We welcome recent steps taken towards more stability in the region, including through talks with armed groups in the framework of the \"EAC DRC Peace Process\" and regional mediation by Angola. We call on all involved to participate in these efforts in good faith and to act in accordance with international law. We are convinced that only broad, multi-sectoral and cross-border cooperation can bring about lasting stability in the region.\n\n11. Haiti\n\nWe express our deep concern at the worsening humanitarian situation in Haiti, particularly the increased spread of cholera and the deepening food and fuel crisis. We condemn the violence perpetrated by armed groups and those who support them. They are terrorizing and holding the population hostage. We reiterate our commitment to support all efforts to quickly resolve the current security and humanitarian crisis. We call on all stakeholders in Haiti to restore order and security and to allow the delivery of the aid required to meet the urgent needs of the population. We commend the UNSC for adopting a sanctions regime on 21 October. We reiterate the importance of establishing the conditions necessary to allow for free and fair elections.",

Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didn't know if its drones were used against Ukraine and stated Iran's commitment to stopping the conflict.\n\nUkrenergo, the sole operator of Ukraine's high-voltage transmission lines, said in an online statement Saturday that scheduled blackouts will take place in the capital and the greater Kyiv region, as well as several regions around it Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv.\n\nThe outages for \"certain groups of consumers\" will occur daily \"in accordance with a specific schedule drawn up by operators of distribution networks for each region,\" the statement said. The outages are expected to last for six and more hours each day.\n\nA woman walks her dog during a blackout in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. Andrew Kravchenko / AP\n\nUkraine has been grappling with power outages and disruption of water supplies since Russia started unleashing massive barrages of missile and drone strikes on the country's energy infrastructure last month.\n\nMoscow has said those came in response to what it alleged were Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, the region that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine has denied those allegations.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian shelling of Ukrainian regions continued into the early hours of Saturday.\n\nAbout 40 shells were fired overnight at the city of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said on Telegram. The Russian forces targeted the city and the areas around it from heavy artillery. Two fires broke out, and more than a dozen of residential and utility buildings, as well as a gas pipeline, were damaged, the official said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian forces shot down a drone and another projectile, according to Reznichenko.\n\nIn the southern Mykolaiv region, the overnight shelling of rural areas damaged several houses, but didn't cause any casualties, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitali Kim said on Telegram.\n\nThe Russian forces also fired missiles at the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, which has been illegally annexed by Moscow and large parts of which remain occupied. According to regional Gov. Oleksandr Starukh, the attack took place shortly after midnight and damaged buildings of three businesses, as well as a number of cars.\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, also annexed and partially occupied by Russia, eight cities and villages have been shelled, including Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Porkovsk.\n\nAccording to Ukraine's presidential office, at least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded over the past 24 hours by Russian shelling of nine Ukrainian regions, where drones, missiles and heavy artillery were used.\n\nIn the Russian-occupied Kherson region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway, the Russian military continue to abduct local residents, the presidential office said, with the most recent cases taking place over the past 24 hours.",

                "cc_text": "With Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine currently in its ninth month, the ongoing war is high on the agenda as Americans prepare to vote in next weeks midterm elections. The US has led international efforts to bolster the Ukrainian fight back against Kremlin aggression and has provided Ukraine with crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support, but recent statements from both sides of the political divide indicate that this support cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe most widely reported comments came from senior Republican and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who indicated in early October that a future Republican-controlled Congress would not be prepared to offer Ukraine any more \"blank checks.\" Meanwhile, a letter sent to President Biden by a group of 30 progressive Democrat lawmakers calling for a Ukraine ceasefire push was hastily withdrawn in late October following a strong backlash.\n\nWhile the political debate continues, survey data indicates strong US public backing for policies in support of Ukraine. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in early October found that 73% of Americans believed the United States should maintain support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, 66% of respondents said Washington specifically should continue providing weapons to Ukraine, up from 51% in a similar poll two months earlier. The latest University of Maryland poll reached similar conclusions.\n\nWith the outcome of Russias Ukraine war still very much in the balance, the coming US vote has the potential to shape the geopolitical landscape for the coming years. The Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their views on what the midterm elections might mean for Ukraine.\n\nDaniel Fried, Distinguished Fellow, Atlantic Council: If the Republicans take Congress (or even one House), the domestic political dynamic in Washington will shift toward confrontation with Republicans spending time on investigators, allegations, and accusations.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Republicans will be split between neo-Reaganist and Trumpist wings. Both will attack the Biden Administration and push it to be tougher on China and Iran. Both wings will also push for greater burden sharing (meaning defense spending) by US allies. The neo-Reaganites will urge more push back against Putin while the Trumpists will either argue for pulling back from support for Ukraine or, in extreme cases, argue that accommodation with Russia is in the US national interest. Their stance will resemble the \"isolationist\" position of indifference to Hitlers rise in the late 1930s.\n\nThe Democrats and neo-Reaganite Republicans will generally support Ukraine. Democrats may split, with a few hard left Democrats taking positions similar to Republicans who want to distance the US from Ukraine. But they will be few in number. Republicans who oppose continued aid to Ukraine will be larger in number. But Congress is unlikely to follow their lead.\n\nCalls for negotiations on Putins terms, meaning that the US should push Ukraine to surrender its people and land to Russia, will grow but are unlikely to prevail as long as Putin keeps demanding the fruits of victory over Ukraine that he has not and may never attain. In short, US support for Ukraine will continue as Russian atrocities continue and as Ukrainians continue to resist effectively.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nSuriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy learned the hard way in 2019 how much domestic US politics can affect Ukraines reality. He and his team would be right to worry about next weeks polls. Whether or not the GOP will follow through on its threats to scale back Ukraine aid is impossible to predict, but it is definitely a real possibility.\n\nThis was Putins plan all along. He has aimed to cause an energy crisis that would drive up inflation and thereby trigger popular dissatisfaction that would result in the fall of governments and leaders opposed to him and his war in Ukraine. If the Republicans take the House and proceed to cut or reduce US support for Ukraine, they will be acting in Putins interests. Let us hope that threats to do so are campaign posturing and nothing more.\n\nIt is possible to argue that US President Joe Biden and his advisors have fallen short in their handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless, helping Putin in his self-proclaimed genocidal conquest of an emerging European democracy is absolutely the wrong way to voice legitimate criticisms of US foreign policy. Whatever the outcome of the midterm elections, the US must not enable Putin.\n\nKristina Hook, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University: American public opinion on Ukraine is remarkably bipartisan and durable, with 73% of Americans agreeing in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll that the US should continue to support Ukraine despite Russias nuclear saber-rattling. Two-thirds of Americans say they are closely following the war, which is particularly notable as coverage has declined and reporting has transitioned away from gripping human interest stories to focus on important military dynamics.\n\nThese numbers imply that consensus surrounding Ukraine has held throughout the routine politicization of an election cycle. Regardless of the midterm results, I therefore expect the majority of US politicians across the aisle to reflect the public sentiment of their voters, who correctly understand the moral stakes of Russias brutal violence against Ukrainians.\n\nAs the politicking of the US election cycle declines after the midterms, I expect an increase in bipartisan articulations of the strategic importance of a clear Russian defeat for the preservation of the rules-based global order that underpins US political stability and economic success. Ukraines struggle for independence from a ruthless adversary resonates with American voters, yet a key post-midterm question remains if and how new and returning Congressional leaders will convey the national security impetus for Ukraines victory.\n\nDoug Klain, Nonresident Fellow, Atlantic Council: Support for Ukraine is one of the few issues that has managed to remain largely bipartisan in the United States. Regardless of the midterm elections, the American public is still overwhelmingly in favor of continued aid to Ukraine. Its also likely that the majority of Congress will remain in favor of further aid to Ukraine, no matter the outcome on November 8.\n\nThats the good news. However, within both parties there are prominent voices calling for a shift in policy that would embolden Russia and put Ukraine in a worse position at the negotiating table, when that day eventually arrives. This is the reason why the Biden Administration is reportedly mulling a legislative blitz during the lame-duck session to lock in another critical package of Ukraine aid. Weve seen in the past how vocal minorities in Congress have been able to gum up the works and stop major legislation from sailing smoothly to the Presidents desk. Continued aid for Ukraine may become a target if these factions grow their numbers in Congress.\n\nWhile the consensus in Washington is likely to remain in favor of steadfast support for Ukraine, a more vocal opposition to aid means that Ukraines friends need to step up efforts to communicate with the American public about why this aid is in the interests of the US. This means making clear that Ukraines success is also a win for the United States.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON The U.S. has information that indicates North Korea is covertly supplying Russia with a \"significant\" number of artillery shells for its war against Ukraine, the White Houses National Security Council spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nJohn Kirby said North Korea is \"trying to make it appear as though theyre being sent to countries in the Middle East or North Africa.\"\n\nHe declined to provide a specific estimate on the quantity of ammunition being sent to bolster the Russian effort, but noted the U.S. doesnt believe \"they are in such a quantity that the would change the momentum of the war.\"\n\nU.S. officials believe the shipments, with drones Russia has acquired from Iran, show that the grinding war and Western sanctions have sapped Russias arsenals and ability to produce new weapons.\n\n\"As [Russian President Vladimir Putin] continues to lose ground, lose soldiers, to lose momentum, hes reaching beyond his borders,\" Kirby said. \"Its a sign both of the isolation that he continues to feel economically. His own defense-industrial base cant keep up with the pace at which he is using armaments in Ukraine.\"\n\nAfter the White House warned Russia might look to North Korea for new arms, Pyongyang in September denied it had or would do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House did not provide evidence to support the new accusations or answer questions about how many weapons were involved, how they were being conveyed or how the U.S. might respond.\n\nAsked about the number of shells, Kirby said: \"Were not talking dozens here. Its a significant amount.\"\n\nThe U.S. was monitoring to see whether the weapons were received and would consult with allies and partners about what accountability measures to apply, he explained.\n\nThe Biden administration warned last week Russia might seek short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles from Iran, but Kirby said there was no indication that had happened as of Wednesday. Russia has been using Iranian-made drones to strike Ukraines power stations and other civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe White House reaffirmed its willingness, and the willingness of allies, to provide military aid to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Bruce Klingner, a former CIA Korea deputy division chief now with the Heritage Foundation, North Korea would likely be providing Russia with 122mm and 152mm shells, as well as rounds for multiple rocket launchers. Those rounds would be compatible with Russian systems and from systems North Korea is trying to replace with newer systems, which require new calibers, he said.\n\nThe age and quality of the rounds involved is an open question. During the Norths artillery bombardment of South Koreas Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, a quarter of the rounds that hit the island didnt detonate. \"If its older ammo, then that also raises the idea of quality,\" Klingner said.\n\nTension on the peninsula\n\nThe White House also condemned North Koreas \"reckless\" launch of at least 23 missiles 17 in the morning and six in the afternoon there on Wednesday off its eastern and western coasts. It said the weapons were all short-range ballistic missiles or suspected surface-to-air missiles.\n\nNorth Korea also fired about 100 artillery shells into an eastern maritime buffer zone the Koreas created in 2018 to reduce tensions, according to South Koreas military. The launches came after North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons to get the U.S. and South Korea to \"pay the most horrible price in history\" in protest of ongoing South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.\n\nThe White House maintained that the United States has no hostile intent toward North Korea and vowed to work with allies to curb the Norths nuclear ambitions.\n\n\"These launches did not pose an immediate threat to the American homeland or U.S. personnel, and we are of course coordinating with our allies and partners,\" Kirby said, defending the ongoing exercises as long planned.\n\n\"Theres an annual exercise ongoing right now, bilateral exercises in South Korea,\" Kirby said. \"These launches just underscore the need to make sure we have the appropriate military readiness in and around the region.\"\n\nThis years Vigilant Storm military exercises are the largest-ever for the annual fall maneuvers, according to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. About 1,600 flights are planned involving 240 American and South Korean fighter jets. The round-the-clock drills, which began Oct. 31, are to continue through Nov. 4 and include warfighting tactics both in the air and on the ground, it said.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will welcome South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-Sup at the Pentagon on Thursday, the department announced separately on Wednesday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nJoe Gould was the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

                "cc_text": "By Mike Whitney\n\nTheres no doubt that the retreat from Kherson was a black-eye for the Russian Army. Theres also no doubt that the general who ordered the evacuation made the right decision. True, the optics are terrible, but optics dont win wars. Strategy, valor and firepower wins wars. Russian General Sergey Surovikin appears to grasp that fact which is why he made the unpopular decision to retreat.\n\nSurovikin could have made the more politically acceptable choice and defended Kherson to the end, but the risks far outweighed the benefits. By all accounts, the 25,000 Russian troops in the city could have easily been encircled and annihilated by Ukrainian artillery. Additionally, Surovikin would have been forced to commit more troops to a rescue mission that would not have advanced Russias overall military strategy in the slightest. Russias immediate goal is to complete the liberation of the Donbas, a task that is not yet finished and which requires more of the troops that had been pinned-down in Kherson.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the retreat from Kherson was a no-brainer. If the nightmare scenario had unfolded as many had expected and thousands of Russian soldiers wound up surrounded and slaughtered in defense of a city that holds little strategic value, then popular support for the war in Russia would have vanished overnight. Neither Putin nor Surovikin could afford to take that risk. So, instead, they opted to pack-it-in and evacuate while they still could, which of course, incited the fury of their critics who are still hopping mad. The good news, however, is that the Kherson public relations disaster will have no meaningful impact on the outcome of the war. Russia is still on-track to achieve all of its strategic objectives despite the pitfalls it has encountered along the way. Heres a brief recap of the Russian withdrawal from an interview with Colonel Douglas MacGregor:\n\n\"When General Surovikin took command it was decided that Russia was going to wait for a decisive operation to end the war. In other words, no more simply defending southern Ukraine and the territory weve annexed, no more expectations of negotiations with anyone those are over we have to end the war. How do you end the war? Well, you launch operations that are so devastating in their destructiveness that the enemy cannot resist them. However, if you are going to do that youre going to have to scale back current activities. (like Kherson) In other words, you have to make changes on the ground, shuffle troops, change resource commitments because you are now building up for forces that are not yet in southern Ukraine but are being prepared with this mobilization of 300,000 troops integrated into this new force for future operations which will come this winter once the ground freezes. So, I would regard (the withdrawal) as an operational decision with short-term benefit in support of the long-term strategy of building this enormous striking powerThe Russians no longer place any confidence in negotiations. I dont think we could say anything to the Russians at this point that would persuade them to stop.\" (\"EVERYTHING changes in 4 weeks: Interview with Colonel Douglas MacGregor\", youtube; Start at 50 seconds)\n\nSo, according to MacGregor, the repositioning of troops is key to the overall strategy which has changed under Surovikin. Under the new commander, the primary focus of military operations is the annihilation of all forces and assets that allow the enemy to continue to wage war. I suspect that means the removal of the Zelensky regime and his security services, but I could be wrong. In any event, the upcoming Russian offensive is going to be much more in-line with a conventional combined-arms ground war than with the Special Military Operation weve seen up to this point. Moscow is determined settle the issue as quickly as possible and as forcefully as necessary. There wont be any more messing around.\n\nThat said, recent reports (see below) suggest that the Biden administration may deploy US combat troops to the theatre in response to any Russian escalation that could threaten to alter the course of the war. If these reports prove to be accurate, then the greatly-anticipated winter offensive could trigger a direct conflagration between the United States and Russia. Given the trajectory of the war to this point, we think its only a matter of time before Washington emerges from behind its proxies and engages Russian troops on the battlefield. There are many indications that the Pentagon is already preparing for that eventuality.\n\nSecret communications between national security advisor Jake Sullivan and the former Russian ambassador to Washington, Yuri Yushakov, and the former head of the FSB, Nikolai Patrushev, suggest that Sullivan warned his Russian counterparts that the US would not allow Russia to settle the conflict on its own terms, but would take whatever steps were needed to prevent a decisive Russian victory. Check out this excerpt from another interview with Colonel Douglas MacGregor:\n\nMacGregor \"Jake Sullivan talked about the dangers of escalation He simply said that We see evidence that you, Russia, are preparing to escalate this conflict. Which is true; we have been talking about this (impending Russian winter) offensive. And we are warning you against that (said Sullivan) The unspoken implication at this point, is that were prepared to jump into this conflict in some way because we will not allow you to partition Ukraine. We will not allow you to fight and win this war on your terms Napolitano Do you know whether Sullivan mentioned the presence of the 40,000 US troops (101st Airborne) in Poland? MacGregor We dont (know that) But we think based on the language that has leaked-out in the paragraph I received from another source, that he (Sullivan) did imply that they have 90,000 troops in Poland and Romania, and that, potentially, if Russia escalated, presumably on the scale that we think the Russians will escalate that we (the US) might be prepared to jump in. And we would jump in with 40,000 US troops, 30,000 Polish troops and 20,000 Romanian troops.. Sullivan made it clear that we are in a position to intervene.\" \"What we dont know is what the Russians said in response, because if you are Russian, the red line is clear: If you move into Ukraine, youre going to be at war with Russia. We seem to be in denial about that.\" Napolitano \"Let me get this straight: Are you of the belief, that Jake Sullivanthreatened the Russians that if they crossed these red lines, they would meet with US military resistance in Ukraine?\" MacGregor I think that implication was made. That is the impression I am getting and I dont think we should be surprised about that because Ukraines position is deteriorating very rapidly And we are very concerned about a Ukrainian collapse. Some estimates indicate that the entire economy and social structure will collapse within 60 days. Some say they are going to general mobilization in Ukraine right now, which may include women, because their manpower base is exhausted. And, remember, people continue to leave Ukraine as much as possible because nobody wants to be stuck in a country that shortly will have no power, no electricity, and where there will be trouble getting water, and trouble getting food. The situation in Ukraine is dire.\" Napolitano What are 40,000 US troops in the 101st Airborne doing in Poland? MacGregor They are preparing for combat operations. Napolitano Has the Department of Defense given the President of the United States plans for the entry of US troops into Ukraine? Is that done? MacGregor I think those plans have certainly been discussed if not briefed to Jake Sullivan. Certainly, the Secretary of State (Anthony Blinken) is aware. I dont know what theyve told the president. My hope is that he received some briefing. Again, this is all very serious because we are in the middle of an election and this could happen without any consultation with Congress whatsoever. Napolitano What is the status of the 300,000 reservists that Putin called up a month ago? MacGregor The majority of them have already been integrated into formations and units alot of them have gone into units that were under-strength that are now back to full strength. Some have gone into new units. (Note: I think MacGregor could be wrong about this. Other analysts suggest that only 80,000 reservists have been sent to Ukraine so far. The process could take a few months before the entire deployment is concluded.) Its almost complete but, the bottom line is, the low temperature in Ukraine has been 37 degrees. which means youre still going to be stuck in the mud whether you are attacking or defending. Until the ground freezes, I dont think alot going to happenBut when the winter arrives and the ground freezes, that is when the Russians will attack. And we see evidence of this from at least three different directions including the east, the southeast and the north. And, judging from the (military) buildup and the weapons systems that are in place and supplies that are available, this is an offensive that is designed to end the war.Whether it will or not, we dont know. But I think that is the idea. MacGregor Theres one last thing Id like to leave you with: When General Surovikin, the commander of the western theatre accepted his appointment, he made these brief remarks. He said \"A Syrian solution for Ukraine is unacceptable.\" In other words, we will not allow Ukraine to fall under the influence of various actors that maintain Ukraine in a state of permanent turmoil and war. Thats a very clear signal, that when they launch (the winter offensive) they plan to put an end to the conflict. So, it would be very unwise for us to get in the way of this..We simply do not have the level of support to guarantee success.\" (\"This is a Red Line in Ukraine\", Colonel Douglas MacGregor, Judging Freedom)\n\nRussia is now prepared to do whatever it takes to win the war quickly and roll-up the hostile army that poses a threat to its national security. If US forces join the fighting, the calculus for winning could change dramatically, but the strategic objectives would remain the same. No nation can be expected to live at peace when a gun is pointed at its head. That is why Putin opposed NATO membership for Ukraine, and that is why the current war is being fought.\n\nViews expressed are the authors own",

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nAfter months of denials, Iran's government admitted to shipping lethal drones to Russia but claimed it happened before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in late February. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian over the weekend publicly confirmed the drone shipments, but U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley refuted his claims about their timing. Malley wrote on Twitter that, \"Iran didn't give a limited number of drones before the war. They transferred dozens just this summer & have military personnel in occupied Ukraine helping Russia use them against Ukrainian civilians.\" Amirabdollahian said that \"if it is proven to us that Russia has used Iranian drones in the Ukraine war, we won't be indifferent to it.\" Iran's drones have been used to brutal effect on Ukraine's civilian centers and critical energy infrastructure, as Russia's bombardment appears intent on making parts of the country unlivable as winter sets in. They've also come in handy for Moscow as Russia's military runs low on more advanced weaponry like guided missiles.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi greets Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 19, 2022. Putin likely wanted to show that Moscow is still important in the Middle East by visiting Iran, said John Drennan of the U.S. Institute of Peace. Sergei Savostyanov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nBut with Iran's economy in tatters, due in large part to international sanctions, why would it supply Moscow with lethal weaponry in a war that's already so globally condemned?\n\nIran 'doesn't have a lot of friends'\n\nThe answer is manifold, but centers on Iran pursuing strengthened relations with a key strategic ally, Russia; helping Moscow in its effort to combat Western hegemony; and enhancing its own role as a major weapons exporter. \"Iran's immediate goal is to bolster a key ally's military effort in Ukraine when it's clear the Russian war effort is faltering and it's having trouble resupplying its more advanced cruise missiles and drones,\" Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Rane, told CNBC. \"But,\" he added, \"I think this speaks to a wider Iranian ambition to try to ensure that the war doesn't go so badly for the Russian government that their ally is destabilized.\"\n\nThey're very close, and with Russia's new isolation, more dependent on each other than ever. Hussein Ibish Senior resident scholar, the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington\n\nIran \"doesn't have a lot of friends let alone great powers that will offer it any kind of security guarantee,\" Bohl said. \"Russia's security support to Iran is far from perfect, but it is certainly better than nothing.\" And as Iran expands its weapons production and exports, Russia's war in Ukraine also serves as a place where Iranian weapons can be used at scale to further test and refine them, he said. Russia and Iran share a desire to disrupt Western hegemony, and Moscow in particular targets U.S. influence around what it deems its own sphere of influence the former Soviet states, many of which are now members of NATO. \"Iran regards its alliance with Russia as a key strategic advantage in their international relations,\" said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"Both parties are pushing back against Western sanctions and are revisionist, anti-status quo powers seeking to change the orders and power structures in their regions and in the world beyond,\" Ibish said. \"They're very close, and with Russia's new isolation, more dependent on each other than ever.\"\n\nA drone launch during a military exercise in an undisclosed location in Iran captured in a handout image obtained on Aug. 25, 2022. Iranian Army | West Asia News Agency | via Reuters\n\nHe added, \"Iran also seeks to become a major weapons exporter, adding another source of foreign exchange to their limited coffers.\" Iran is reportedly preparing to sell Russia more attack drones as well as its indigenously made ballistic missiles, and a top Iranian general said during a speech in mid-October that 22 countries are looking to buy its drones. Iran's foreign minister has denied the reports about potential missile shipments, calling them \"completely wrong.\" But it's often the case in Iran that the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military entity that answers only to the supreme leader, makes decisions on weapons and overseas conflicts independently of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nHow it could backfire\n\nIran's weapons support to Russia could trigger yet more Western sanctions in fact, it already has. The U.S. and EU have sanctioned several people and entities in Iran over its drone sales to Russia, and Kyiv has downgraded its diplomatic ties with Tehran. And \"it could backfire if its weapons prove faulty or ineffective,\" Ibish said, although there isn't any major evidence of this so far.\n\nA drone launch from an Iranian military ship in the Indian ocean, Iran, captured in a handout image obtained on July 15, 2022. Iranian Army | Via Reuters\n\nRane's Bohl added that Iran's drone shipments can also create blowback for Russia by incentivizing the West to send more advanced air defense systems to Ukraine. \"Such systems could become a big headache for the Russians and could make Iran's drones and missiles look ineffective while teaching Western militaries how better to counter them,\" he said. The apparent support for Russia further isolates Iran from the international community, which has condemned its violent crackdown against a female-led protest movement, sparked by the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini while in police custody.\n\nA game-changer?\n\nStill, conflict analysts say, the drones themselves are not likely to turn the tide of the war for Russia, which has struggled to make significant territorial gains for months now and has been pushed back in many areas by Ukrainian counteroffensives. \"Overall, [the drones] are not a game changer because while they can carry out precision strikes against civilian infrastructure and individual units, they can't reverse the loss of territory that Russia has been enduring since the Kharkiv offensive,\" Bohl said. \"Russia needs troops on the ground who are trained and capable and it simply doesn't have that despite mobilization.\" But if Iran sends ballistic missiles to Russia, that changes the calculus, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military personnel stand guard next to two Iranian Kheibar Shekan allistic missiles in downtown Tehran as demonstrators wave Iranian and Syrian flags during a rally commemorating the International Quds Day, also known as the Jerusalem day, on April 29, 2022.

                "cc_text": "2:16 p.m. EST\n\nMR PRICE: Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nQUESTION: Hello.\n\nMR PRICE: Happy Monday. Will take your questions in just a moment, but first, last weeks African Union announcement of the signing of a cessation of hostilities between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front, or TPLF, represents, as weve said, a significant step towards peace. We again commend the parties for reaching an agreement and applaud the African Union and the governments of Kenya and South Africa for helping to drive this process.\n\nThe parties are in Nairobi, in keeping with the provision that the Ethiopian National Defense Fund and the Tigrayan Defense Force would meet within five days to work out the implementation. Also, as provided by the agreement, a hotline has been established between the two senior-most commanders.\n\nThese concrete implementation steps reflect a commitment by both parties to, quote/unquote, \"silence the guns.\" But more work remains. We understand the agenda for the Nairobi talks will also include the urgent need to expedite humanitarian assistance and restoration of services for Tigray and adjoining affected regions of Afar and Amhara, in accordance with the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement. The talks are being presided over by the AU High Level Panel of former presidents Obasanjo and Kenyatta, the AU Commission, and with the participation of Kenyan and South African generals. The observers include the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, or IGAD, and the U.S., represented by our special envoy, Mike Hammer. Our special envoy is remaining in the region to support implementation of the Pretoria agreement. We stand ready to continue to support the parties along with the international partners on implementation of the agreement.\n\nAnd then finally, today the U.S. Department of State, through the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program, announced a reward offer of up to $1 million for information leading to the arrest and/or convictions of three Haitian nationals: Lanm Sanjou, a/k/a Joseph Wilson; Jermaine Stephenson, a/k/a Gaspiyay; and VitelHomme Innocent.\n\nOn October 16th, 2021, the 400 Mawozo gang, of which these individuals are members, engaged in a conspiracy to kidnap 16 U.S. Christian missionaries and one Canadian missionary to hold them for ransom. The missionaries and their families were abducted after visiting an orphanage in the town of Ganthier, east of Port-au-Prince. The kidnapping victims of the 12 missionary of the missionary group included 12 adults and five children.\n\nThe United States support the efforts of our Haitian law enforcement partners seeking to enforce rule of law in Haiti, and to combat transnational organized crime. Supporting the Haitian people is a whole-of-government effort. This reward offer complements the U.S. Department of Justices announcement of felony indictments against Wilson, Sanjou, and Innocent for their roles in the kidnapping. Currently, all three individuals are fugitives from justice.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Great. Thanks, Ned. Happy Monday.\n\nMR PRICE: Happy Monday.\n\nQUESTION: Before I get to a question on Russia, I just want to ask real quick because I dont think youll have a lot on this, but I just want to make sure and that is the murder of a USAID worker in Baghdad. Have you\n\nMR PRICE: Youre right. We dont have much to offer on this publicly just yet. Were of course aware of these reports. Were looking into these reports. There is a process that we would need to undertake, if and when we are in a position to confirm that an American has been killed. We would of course first notify the next of kin before making any public comment. So, were still looking into these reports to determine what we can regarding these allegations.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, does that mean that youre that you dont even know if someone has been has been killed in the circumstances that were described?\n\nMR PRICE: There is no reason to doubt that someone has been killed, as the reports indicate. But we want to be thorough in determining that the victim in this case was in fact a U.S. citizen, and of course then undertaking any necessary efforts to notify next of kin.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And then moving on, unless anyone has more on that, I just want to ask you about this, quote/unquote, \"admission\" by Mr. Prigozhin in Russia that they have interfered, they will continue to interfere, in U.S. elections and what you make of it, if anything.\n\nMR PRICE: Well, I suppose his own statements didnt tell us anything we didnt already know. His bold confession, if anything, appears to be just a manifestation of the impunity that crooks and cronies enjoy under President Putin and the Kremlin.\n\nAs you know, we have sanctioned this individual, Yevgeny Prigozhin, since 2018 for his interference in the with our election processes and institutions. In March of 2018, the Department of the Treasury designated the Internet Research Agency and Prigozhin himself. This designation targeted malicious cyber actors, including those involved in interfering with the election process and institutions.\n\nOn September 20th of 2019, Treasury, under the auspices of OFAC, also took action against Russian actors that attempted to influence the 2018 midterm elections; including previously designated person Yevgeny Prigozhin as well as the employees of the Internet Research Agency which Prigozhin himself finances.\n\nIn July of this year, we put forward a so-called Reward for Justice, or RFJ, seeking information on interference in U.S. elections by the Internet Research Agency, by Prigozhin, and related Russian entities, offering up to $10 million for information on foreign interference in U.S. elections.\n\nWe all know, especially today but every day, the free and fair elections are a cornerstone of American society, of American democracy. We wont tolerate interference in our elections regardless of where it comes from. Weve demonstrated that not only with our words, but with our deeds. In addition to the sanctions against Prigozhin, against the IRA, this administration has announced sanctions against Russia. We did so in April of 2021 in response not only to Russias malicious cyberattack, in the context of Solar Winds and in the context of what it had done to Mr. Navalny with the chemical weapons attack what it was doing to Mr. Navalnys supporters, but also in response to its interference in our elections. Weve done the same against Iran. We are prepared to do the same against any other state or entity that would seek to interfere in our democratic processes.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. You said that his own statements didnt tell you anything that you didnt already know, and then you mentioned how it demonstrates impunity that they act with. But I mean, hes not accused of violating any Russian law. Are you suggesting it demonstrates impunity for him violating U.S. law, and that he should fly over here and turn himself in? Is that\n\nMR PRICE: Clearly, Matt, these are not\n\nQUESTION: Well, I just I mean, it seems like hes boasting, right?\n\nMR PRICE: Its\n\nQUESTION: So but I am not sure how thats a demonstration of his impunity because\n\nMR PRICE: It is a demonstration of impunity that someone anywhere can boast publicly of interfering in the democratic elections of another sovereign country, and that nothing would happen to them. And far from anything having happen to him, in terms of the criminal justice system, the so-called criminal justice system in Russia, he is by all accounts a Kremlin insider. He is someone who is a prized associate of\n\nQUESTION: But that but the point, I mean, do you expect Putin to act against him?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, we dont\n\nQUESTION: Okay, all right.\n\nQUESTION: We dont expect President Putin to act against him, but wed like to see the Russian Federation act against someone who so openly boasts about interfering in the elections of a sovereign country. Of course, we would expect that of a responsible law enforcement system of a responsible government; but of course we know better than to expect that of Russia.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, just a clarification. So, you said boasting and so on. He could be just making himself a lot more important than he really is. I mean, are the Russians really involved in this thing? Do you think that he would say this without giving being given a green light by Putin, frankly?\n\nMR PRICE: So, I will leave it to my colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to speak to what the current threat environment looks like. But what I will say is that we know that both the IRA and its benefactor Prigozhin have been involved in election interference in the past. We are very closely watching the Department of Homeland Security is very closely watching any potential efforts to interfere, whether its with disinformation or misinformation or otherwise, in our upcoming midterm elections or other democratic processes in this country.\n\nSo, whether everything he has said over the past day or so is completely accurate, thats not something Im going to weigh in on. But what I will weigh in on is that this is an individual who has and continues to claim to be interfering in our democratic processes. And thats something we take seriously.\n\nQUESTION: So, do you think that it is maliciously intended, right on the eve of the midterm elections, to sow to throw some sort of a monkey wrench if they can into this election?\n\nMR PRICE: Look, I am not going ascribe any particular, motive to these statements, whether it was boasting, whether it was bragging, whether there was some broader strategic intent. What we do know, and weve spoken to this publicly a number of weeks ago now, is Russias efforts around the world to interfere in the election, in the electoral processes of sovereign countries. We declassified and made public at the time that Russia has invested at least $300 million in these efforts. Its efforts have been well publicized in some instances, including in the context of our elections in 2016. There is an Intelligence Community assessment that lays that out. There is a public version of that that lays that out in some detail.\n\nBut Russias efforts to subvert democratic processes are of course not confined to the United States. Theyre not confined to any one country. What we will do is to respond, and to respond decisively, to any country any actor that seeks to interfere in our elections.\n\nAlex. Or sure.\n\nQUESTION: On this line, given who he is, is it your assessment that his actions have been sanctioned by President Putin himself? And when you talk about impunity\n\nMR PRICE: Sanctioned as in authorized?\n\nQUESTION: Authorized, yes.\n\nMR PRICE: Okay, because we have sanctioned him.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\n\nMR PRICE: Look, it is its difficult to say. I think what is clear is that someone of this stature, someone who is making these sorts of claims, would not be in a position to do so, going back to Matts question, if the Kremlin at some level didnt approve of it. The lack of action against an individual like this is itself a pretty telling action. It is an indication that he has, at least, some degree of tacit permission from senior officials in the Russian Government.\n\nWhat we do know about and this goes back to the publicly released intelligence assessment from a number of years ago now is that when it comes to Russias previous interference in our elections, it was approved at the highest levels of the Kremlin. But again, when it comes to what is the threat we may be facing now from Russia or from any other state actor, that is something that I would refer you to the Intelligence Community or to DHS.\n\nQUESTION: And when you talk about impurity, is the U.S. Government ready to sanction President Putin himself for\n\nMR PRICE: We have sanctioned President Putin himself.\n\nQUESTION: Election in terms of violating, interfering with U.S. election process?\n\nMR PRICE: We have sanctioned President Putin himself for the actions hes taken in recent months. Of course, Im not going to preview what might happen in this upcoming midterm election or what could happen going forward but suffice to say that we will respond. And we will respond decisively to any country, to any entity, to any individual that seeks to interfere in our elections.\n\nQUESTION: And in terms of his actions in recent months, can I get your comment on the reported talks with the Russians? Are there different camps inside the administration in terms of how to deal with Russia at this point?\n\nMR PRICE: There is both in this administration and with our European allies a firm recognition of the principle that has animated our efforts since before February 24th, and that is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. That is something that we have all subscribed to. It is something that youve heard from this administration; its something that youve heard from our partners as well.\n\nMore recently, youve heard from the United States and from our partners, including in the G7 statement that was just released at the conclusion of the ministerial in Mnster there was a reference to this in the leaders statement some weeks back that we believe, as do the Ukrainians, in a just peace a just peace that respects the UN Charters principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty, that would safeguard Ukraines ability to defend itself in the future, that would ensure Ukraines recovery, its reconstruction, and would provide for accountability for Russias assault on Ukraine and its commission of war crimes.\n\nIf Russia is ready for that negotiation, it should stop its bombs. It should stop its missiles. It should stop attacking and killing Ukrainian civilians pursuing infrastructure, including civilian infrastructure. But of course, the Kremlin is doing the opposite. It is continuing to escalate this war rather than to offer any sort of real signal that it is ready for or open to negotiations.\n\nIf Russia wants to negotiate, why then did it walk away, even if temporarily, from the Black Sea Grain Initiative? That was perhaps the one forum where Russians and Ukrainians spoke and now speak, directly, on a daily basis. If it wants to demonstrate a serious commitment to deescalation, Russia could start by committing to renew this Black Sea Grain Initiative when it comes up for renewal later this month.\n\nBut it is not just us saying this. Youve heard this as well from our Ukrainian partners. President Zelenskyy gave an address over the weekend. He said, quote, \"We are ready for peace, for a fair and just peace, the formula of which we have voiced many times. The world knows our position. This is respect for the UN Charter, respect for our territorial integrity, respect for our people.\" He has said a number of times that this war can only end through dialogue and diplomacy. We feel exactly the same. Our European allies feel exactly the same.\n\nBut it is incumbent upon Russia to signal its willingness and its readiness to sit down to engage with the Ukrainians. Instead, the only signal Russia has sent is one of death, is one of destruction, is one of continued brutality.\n\nDaphne.\n\nQUESTION: An Italian paper is reporting that NATO and the EU are discussing possible talks with Russia after Ukraine liberates Kherson. Can you confirm this, and are you viewing that as a sort of turning point?\n\nMR PRICE: Yeah, the notion is that the Ukrainians would begin?\n\nQUESTION: That NATO and the EU are discussing possible talks with Russia after Ukraine\n\nMR PRICE: So, I would have to refer to NATO and to the EU for any plans they have. But I feel confident in stating, as I just did a moment ago, that we are firmly of the belief, NATO is firmly of the belief, and the EU is firmly of the belief that there can be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\n\nSo, certainly, it is not the case that and again, without speaking for NATO or the EU, but I am confident in saying that it is not the case that NATO and the EU would separately engage with Russia to determine the future of Ukraine and determine how this conflict ends. That is only something that Ukraine can do with Russia. These are decisions that the Ukrainian Government is going to have to make as the democratically elected representative of the Ukrainian people. It is something that President Zelenskyy has said he is committed to pursuing. He has said that this war will only end through dialogue and diplomacy; it cant end decisively on the battlefield. It wont end decisively on the battlefield. But ultimately, this is going to have to be a process between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIn the interim, we are going to continue the process that we have had underway since before February 24th, and this is also something weve done in close coordination with the EU and with NATO, and that is to continue providing Ukraine with the security assistance it needs, the economic assistance it needs, and the humanitarian assistance it needs so that when that negotiating table develops, Ukraine will be in the strongest possible position. Nobody wants this war to end more than the Ukrainian people. No one has been more brutalized and battered than the Ukrainian people, of course. So, they have every incentive to see this war come to a close, but what we want to see is that they are in the strongest position despite what Russia is doing to them day in, day out to try to weaken them, to try to break them. And were going to continue providing our Ukrainian partners with what they need not only to withstand this aggression but to emerge strong and capable at the negotiating table.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: But Ned, that could go on for a very long time, as you know. In the meantime, the war is going on. Nobody seems to be winning. Despite all the claims that the Ukrainians are making progress, the Russians going back but anyway, theyre there. Theyre not going anywhere anytime soon. So, you have to be looking at backdoor channels to have some sort of not necessarily at this moment negotiations per se, but you have to be looking at other options because this could go on forever. So, what do you say to that? There has been contacts or of course, Jake Sullivan was in Ukraine. Theres been contacts with the Russians and what have you. So, what under what conditions could you be open to some sort of diplomatic solution besides saying that obviously Russia stop the war, because thats not going to happen?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, there seem to be a couple elements to your question. One has to do with the modalities of a negotiation, two has to do with the timing of any potential negotiation, and three pertains to any contacts on the part of the United States. So, Ill take those in turn.\n\nThe first two, really the answer is the same: It is up to the Ukrainians to determine what those negotiations look like. And were when were talking about negotiations in this context, Im referring to negotiations between it has to be Russia and Ukraine, regarding the end to the war. It is up to Ukraine to determine who exactly is involved in this process, what precisely this process looks like. Of course, the United States and Ukraines many partners around the world stand ready to assist and to offer counsel and advice, but ultimately these are going to have to be decisions that the Ukrainians themselves make.\n\nWhen it comes to the United States again, I want to be very clear there is no moving there is no budging from our bottom-line position that there is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. At the same time, the United States, as a responsible country, we have an obligation to maintain channels of communication with Russia. We have been very clear about this; in some instances, in spite of efforts of the Russians to make our diplomatic efforts, including those in Moscow, more difficult. But we have been emphatic in the belief that lines of communication and channels of dialogue are important even in times of tension. But they are especially important in times of conflict. So, we have been very intentional and deliberate about seeing to it that those that existing lines of communication are not closed.\n\nAnd youve seen us exercise those lines of communication. We dont broadcast every conversation we have of course, but Secretary Blinken picked up the phone some months ago now because there were issues of great bilateral concern, including the status of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, the two wrongfully detained Americans in Russia. He wanted to send a very stark and clear warning to Russia at the time regarding our knowledge of what it planned to do. More recently, Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley, theyve picked up the phones to their counterparts. Those have been the principal level engagements. But the fact is and of course the White House has read out a conversation that Jake Sullivan has had with a Russian official, a number of months ago. But the fact is, those are all principal level engagements.\n\nWe have a functioning embassy in Moscow. We speak to the Russians via the embassy virtually every day, if not in fact every day. We speak consistently via the we pass messages via the Russian embassy here in Washington. So, there are a number of ways for us to convey messages of bilateral importance to Russia. And I emphasize that word bilateral because we are not discussing with the Russians what a negotiated peace might look like, what the contours of a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine might look like.\n\nWe are discussing issues that have a profound importance in our bilateral relationship. Whether that is the status of the two wrongfully detained Americans, whether thats the status of our embassy in Moscow, whether that is the imperative that the United States has to send a very clear signal to Russia of the enormous costs of escalation, or God forbid, nuclear use, those are the types of conversations that were in a position to have day in, day out. Some of those conversations are routine, are prosaic; others are perhaps more strategic and significant. But the fact is that we believe its very important for us to have those conversations.\n\nJanne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. At\n\nMR PRICE: Anything else on Russia-Ukraine before we Kylie? Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Im just wondering if you would theres been a lot of conversation about diplomacy, and when or if the Biden administration will push for that. Would you say that the Biden administration right now is doing everything that you guys can to urge Russia towards a diplomatic solution?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, and were doing that in a number of ways. One is our messaging, and the very simple message that this war has to end diplomatically; it has to end through dialogue. The Ukrainians are doing this as well.\n\nConsistent with that message is actually what were doing in terms of our provision of support to the Ukrainians. There is not going to be a decisive victory on the battlefield, yet we have provided billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine. Its more than $18 billion since the start of the conflict since the start of Russias war on February 24th. Were providing that to our Ukrainian partners so that they can defend themselves against this all-out Russian aggression, but so too that they can be in a stronger position on at the negotiating table when it develops. We see an interconnection between what happens on the battlefield and what we are in a position to do to provide the sort of security assistance our Ukrainian partners need to defend themselves on that very battlefield and what ultimately happens at the negotiating table.\n\nSame with our economic assistance. President Putin might have thought that he could starve Ukraine into submission, that he could bomb Ukraine into the depths of winter, into darkness. We have supported our Ukrainian partners with billions of dollars in economic assistance, including direct budgetary support, so that they can have an economically viable country, they can have a functioning government, they can provide their citizens with the basic services that they need to do even while they are under this brutal assault from Russia.\n\nSo, we have signaled both in our messaging, in our words, but also in our actions, including the support to Ukraine, that we believe deeply in the necessity of dialogue and diplomacy. Unfortunately, the Russians have signaled certainly in their actions that, at the moment, they are focused on escalation. They are not focused on de-escalation. They are even less so focused on dialogue and genuine diplomacy. Its our goal to help the Ukrainians shift that calculus.\n\nQUESTION: And just one follow-up. There was a line from President Zelenskyy last month that got some pick-up after Washington Post reporting over the weekend where he said, \"We are ready fordialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia.\" What is the Biden administrations response to that comment? Do you agree with that sentiment?\n\nMR PRICE: So, youre asking about the modalities of a negotiation, and obviously what the details of what a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine would look like, that will have to be worked out between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukrainians will determine who their representatives will be, if and when a negotiating table develops. They will determine those individuals theyre willing to speak with, so were not going to weigh in on that. But I think what is much more important is what weve heard repeatedly now from President Zelenskyy, his fervent belief something he has repeated in even in recent days that this war will be ended through dialogue and diplomacy.\n\nQUESTION: But do you think there can be a diplomatic solution without regime change in Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: Regime change is not our goal. It is not the goal of our Ukrainian partners. Our goal is to bring an end to President Putins war. It is to bring an end to it, to help the Ukrainians bring an end to it with a just peace, a just peace that reflects the principles of the UN Charter in terms of sovereignty, in terms of territorial integrity, in terms of a Ukraine that is at peace, that is free, that is stable, thats economically viable, and thats able to defend itself going forward.\n\nQUESTION: Just so we are on same page here, given the report that was just mentioned of the Post, can you explicitly say that nothing that the U.S. Government has done last week or weekend that would suggest that you have been pressuring, advising, recommending Ukrainians talk to the war criminal Putin?\n\nMR PRICE: Were not pressuring our Ukrainian partners. Our Ukrainian partners dont need any pressure to incentivize them to see this war come to an end. No one has suffered more than the Ukrainian people. No one wants to see this war end more than the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Government. So, it is neither our place for us to pressure the Ukrainians, nor would we need to do such a thing. They have every incentive. It is the Russians that are sending a very different signal.\n\nJanne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Last weekend at the UN, a Security Council resolution, China and Russia again opposed adoption of condemnations of North Korea, and China and Russia shifted the blame to the United States. What is the next U.S. next step to do?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, the fact is that we have a slew of sanctions imposed against the DPRK, the United States does. There are a series of UN Security Council resolutions with costs associated with them and measures associated with them, and weve called on all UN member-states, but especially members of the Security Council, especially members of the Security Council that have a solemn obligation to uphold the principles of the UN Charter, the principles of the UN system, the tenets of the international order. Unfortunately, there are two members of the Security Council, the two you named, that have consistently shirked their obligations, that have stood in the way of the ability of the international community to impose additional costs, at least through this venue, on the DPRK for its continued and dangerous and destabilizing provocations that it has mounted in recent weeks and in recent months.\n\nWe have condemned the DPRKs most recent ballistic missile launches, including the ICBM launch earlier this month, the reckless launch of a missile that landed dangerously close to the Republic of Korea. Every single one of these launches threatens regional global peace threatens regional and global peace and stability and is a violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions that were unanimously adopted by the council. So, members, permanent members especially, of the Security Council, have a special obligation. Were especially concerned by the DPRKs increasingly dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric even went so far as to describe its recent missile launches and related activities as, quote/unquote, \"practice runs\" for the use of tactical nuclear weapons against the ROK, against the United States as well.\n\nWe will seek to continue to impose costs on the DPRK for its dangerous and destabilizing behavior even as we continue to seek serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK. Weve called many times now for the DPRK to abandon its provocative behavior and to engage in that meaningful dialogue that we have put forward, but our commitment to the defense of our treaty allies, the ROK and Japan, its ironclad. Well continue to work closely with our allies to limit the DPRKs ability to advance its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile program that threatens regional security.\n\nWhen it comes to the Security Council, we heard from multiple UN Security Council members, including all of the elected members the 10 elected members of the UN Security Council, just how crucial it is to address the advancing threat of the DPRK. And I call out the statement on the part of the 10 elected members of the Security Council because, of course, the two members of permanent members of the Security Council have so far been silent. They have been unable or unwilling, for various reasons, to lend their voices to condemn what is objectively destabilizing and dangerous activity.\n\nWell continue to engage with partners at the Security Council and continue to make the point to them, both in public and private, that a DPRK that feels that it can act with impunity and faces watered-down condemnation from the rest of the international community is not in the interest of China. Its not in the interest of Russia. It is profoundly against the interests of the global order.\n\nQUESTION: Today, North Korean military commander has released a statement saying it will take ruthless counterretaliation against South Korea and the United States. How would you response on this?\n\nMR PRICE: Our response is what youve heard from us throughout this series of provocations: our commitment to the defense and to the security of our treaty allies, Japan and the ROK in this case, is ironclad. We have taken a number of steps when to increase our defense and our deterrence posture, and well continue to calibrate our approach and our activities appropriately.\n\nQUESTION: Do you think quick do you think North Koreas continued provocation is simply set the stage for the dialogue with the United States? Or do you see it is as an actual clash?\n\nMR PRICE: Or do we see it as what was the last part of\n\nQUESTION: Actual clash?\n\nMR PRICE: As an actual crash?\n\nQUESTION: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Clash.\n\nMR PRICE: Oh, threat. Look, I would hate to ascribe a motive and I would hesitate to ascribe a motive to what were hearing from the DPRK. There is a pattern that has played out over the course of decades now of a period of provocation followed by a period of engagement. Whether what were seeing now will be preceded by a change in course, a change in tone from the DPRK, I think its impossible to say with any certainty. What we can do and what we can seek through both punitive measures and through our statements regarding dialogue and diplomacy, we can try to incentivize them in every way we can to come to the table, to engage in practical diplomacy, to make progress towards what is the ultimate goal of the United States, of Japan, of the ROK, and thats the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks. Xi Jinping is planning to visit Saudi Arabia as the U.S. reevaluates its relations with the kingdom. Could you talk a little bit about how DOS weighs Chinas potential to fill the void in foreign economic relations with Saudi Arabia as the U.S. re-evaluates its relations with the kingdom?\n\nMR PRICE: These are going to have to be decisions that both the PRC and Saudi Arabia will come to. Its not for us to say what a bilateral relationship between any two countries when the United States isnt among those two countries should look like.\n\nQUESTION: I do understand that, but do you weigh the potential for China to enter into that void as you determine what your future relationship with the Saudis is going to look like?\n\nMR PRICE: What we weigh are our national interests, and there are a number there are a multiplicity of interests that we have when it comes to our relationship with Saudi Arabia. There are a multiplicity of interests we have when it comes to the bilateral relationship we have with the PRC. So ultimately, we weigh our approach towards any particular country in terms of those interests. We look at the implications of deepening relations between any two countries or any grouping of countries; we look at the implications that might have in terms of our interests. But ultimately, we are going to pursue a path that is predicated solely on our interests and the values that we bring to our work around the world.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. On Bangladesh, millions of people of Bangladesh gathering in rallies various part of the country and demanding voting rights, under a neutral caretaker government. Ruling Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina warned the opposition if the BNP went superfluous in the name of anti-government movement, then opposition leader Khaleda Zia would be sent to jail again as 77-years-old former prime minister, staying at her house with a limited access. And according to State Department reports, her imprisonment is a political ploy to remove her from the political process. So, will you urge the opposition leader of Bangladesh immediate release? And what is your comment on that?\n\nMR PRICE: We put, as you know, democracy and human rights at the center of our relationships around the world, at the center of our foreign policy. We as such regularly raise these issues with governments around the world, including the Government of Bangladesh. We do so both publicly, as Ive done from this room, a number of times. We do so in our private engagements. And in doing so we urge the strengthening of democratic process and political institutions, adherence to the rule of law, and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout Bangladesh for all Bangladeshis.\n\nWith respect to the political process and the next election in Bangladesh, we hope for a robust civic participation, and the people of Bangladesh ultimately will be able to choose their own government through free and fair elections. That is our hope; that is what we continue to support. We urge the Government of Bangladesh to create a safe environment for people to peacefully assemble and to voice their concerns, and relatedly, for opposition parties to campaign without facing intimidation and repression.\n\nLet me Dylan.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, regarding protests in Iran, late last week at a campaign event President Biden said, quote, were going to bring \"Were going to free Iran,\" end quote. Could you shed some light on what that means exactly, the President saying were going to bring were going to free Iran?\n\nMR PRICE: The White House has spoken to this. The President was referring to the sentiment weve put forward since the start of these protests namely, expressing our solidarity with the protesters. Weve been doing that from the very earliest days of these peaceful demonstrations. The fact is that Iran its government is facing problems that are fundamentally of its own making. This is these protests are so powerful, because they are fundamentally not about us. Theyre not about any external actor. They are about the legitimate, theyre about the genuine, theyre about the heartfelt aspirations of the Iranian people.\n\nAnd the reason these protests have continued is because there is a strong sense among the Iranian people that their government is depriving them of their rights, of their aspirations. The Iranian Government would like nothing more for these protests to be about us, for to be able to blame the United States for what theyre seeing. But again, the only entity they can blame is themselves. What we are doing is continuing to look for ways to hold the regime accountable, and to show our solidarity and to show our support with those across Iran who are peacefully demanding the universal rights that are as much theirs as they are to people around the world.\n\nQUESTION: Does it not throw fuel on that fire to some extent that youre referring to Iran trying to make these protests about the U.S. when the President says that were going to implies that were involved, says were going to free them, were going to do something?\n\nMR PRICE: The again, the Iranian regime would like nothing more than for these protests to be about us. We have made very clear, but more importantly, the Iranian people have made very clear that this is a movement that is an expression of their legitimate and their genuine aspirations. We are our role in this is to hold accountable those who are responsible for the repression, for the violence, for these internet blackouts, and to signal our solidarity for the Iranian people in the same way and in similar ways we do it around the world to peaceful to people who are exercising their universal rights.\n\nQUESTION: Just one more quick follow-up. He also said the Iranian people are going to free themselves soon. Is there any indication that you have that theres some impending regime change or shift that we should expect, or was that just an offhand comment?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, its going to be up to the Iranian people to determine the course of this movement. I think what has been so impressive to so many people around the world is that this movement has persisted in the face of violence. Its persisted in the face of repression. Its persisted in the face of systematic efforts to deprive the Iranian people of access to information and the ability to communicate with one another.\n\nThe fact that these protests have continued, again, suggests that this is the widespread and genuine expression of the demands that the Iranian people have for their government. Rather than try to cast aspersions or to cast blame on others, the Iranian Government should listen to their people.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, thank you. Very quickly, moving to the Palestinian to Israeli issue. First of all, have there been any calls between the Secretary of State and the new prime minister would-be, Mr. Netanyahu?\n\nMR PRICE: Said, you may have seen that President Biden had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Netanyahu today, so of course the President would be the first to speak with the with Benjamin Netanyahu to congratulate him, as he did today.\n\nQUESTION: Right, right. Because I know that the Secretary of State spoke to the outgoing prime minister. Thats why I asked.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, former Prime Minister Lapid is someone the Secretary worked with very closely in his capacity as foreign minister, as alternate prime minister, and ultimately as prime minister.\n\nQUESTION: Right. Okay, so let me ask you: on the possible makeup of the Israeli Government, I mean, there is a great deal of talk about Ben-Gvir again, that he might get one of the security ministries responsible for the Palestinians. What is the U.S. position on this? I mean, I know the common wisdom around town, even from very pro-Israeli think tanks and so on, that this should not be the case. Do you have any position on such a choice?\n\nMR PRICE: Said, it is early in the process. Its far too early to speculate on the exact composition of the next governing coalition, as we wait for this process to play out. Well continue to watch this closely, but Im not going to speculate on a hypothetical at this stage in the process.\n\nQUESTION: But I mean, would I think the U.S. would the U.S. look okay or look unkindly on such a choice, considering that he is known for his racist views and called for the killing of Palestinians and so on? At one time they were listed on the terror list in the United States and so on. So, you dont have any position on such a choice?\n\nMR PRICE: As you hear from me almost every day, I dont have a position on a hypothetical.\n\nQUESTION: All right.\n\nMR PRICE: Im not going to speculate. But the point weve also made is that our rock-solid partnership with Israel is based on mutual interests and shared values, and its those shared values that have served as a powerful glue between our two countries over the past more than 60 years now. It is a commitment to the value of open, democratic societies, tolerance, respect for civil society including minorities, and our ultimately, our identities as two democracies.\n\nQUESTION: I understand, and thats always stood. But I remember a case when the United States did not speak to one Israeli minister, Ariel Sharon, for 18 years because of his involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacre, for instance. Are we likely to see something like this, that you will deal with the government you found a way to deal with the government and not deal directly with Mr. Gvir?\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, Said, we will have a rock-solid relationship with Israel. The president had a warm call with incoming Prime Minister Netanyahu, but Im just not going to speculate on a hypothetical so early in the process.\n\nQUESTION: So, if an asteroid were about to crash into the Earth, is it good or bad? (Laughter.)\n\nMR PRICE: That seems to ascribe some\n\nQUESTION: Well, I dont know. I mean, its a hypothetical, right?\n\nMR PRICE: It is a hypothetical.\n\nQUESTION: You have no position? So, it actually might be good?\n\nQUESTION: Let me just\n\nMR PRICE: Go ahead, Said.\n\nQUESTION: A really quick follow-up. I know that the Secretary spoke with Palestinian President Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The situation is just going to hell in a handbasket, as they say. So, what is what is your assessment? What are you trying to do to actually mitigate this very aggressive Israeli behavior in the West Bank?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve spoken for some weeks now about the concern regarding increased violence in the West Bank. Weve re-emphasized the need for all parties to do everything in their power to de-escalate the situation. The recent period, as you know, Said, has seen a sharp and rather alarming increase in Palestinian and Israeli deaths and injuries, including those of numerous children.\n\nWe continue to emphasize and this has really been the predicate of our policy that Israelis and Palestinians deserve to have equal measures of security, of stability, of justice, of dignity, and democracy. Importantly, we have been conveying these messages. Weve been doing so publicly, but weve also been doing so privately. And our message has been, to Palestinians and to Israelis alike, of the vital importance that the parties themselves take urgent action to prevent even greater loss of life. This is something that we have worked on quietly behind the scenes well before the recent flareup in violence, but it is something that weve continued to do in the context of this increase in violence.\n\nMichel.\n\nQUESTION: Do you have any information or any comment on the killing of a U.S. citizen in Baghdad and a kidnapping attempt?\n\nMR PRICE: We discussed this at the very start of the briefing. Were aware of the reports. There is a process that we would need to complete before we were able to confirm anything publicly. Were looking into those reports, gathering the facts, but I dont have any more to offer at this point.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes, Elizabeth.\n\nQUESTION: On Syria, is there anything you can share about the U.S. delegation visit to al-Hol camp this past weekend? Did they offer any additional support to the local authorities there?\n\nMR PRICE: So, I can confirm, as you likely saw, that a U.S. interagency delegation, including State Department officials, visited al-Hol to discuss repatriations assistance and security needs in northeast Syria with local authorities and partners on the ground. We continue to encourage all countries with nationals in northeast Syria to work with us towards durable solutions. We believe its critical that countries of origin repatriate their nationals from repatriate their nationals from, and provide assistance to, northeast Syria to prevent a resurgence of ISIS.\n\nWhen it comes to our policy, its remained clear. We believe that repatriation is the only durable solution to the humanitarian and security situation and displaced persons camp camps in northeast Syria. And we have continued to work with our partners around the world to help them effect those repatriations to alleviate this worsening crisis.\n\nQUESTION: And then one more in the region. At COP27, will the U.S. delegation meet with any of the activists protesting outside? And will human rights be part of the discussions with Egyptian counterparts?\n\nMR PRICE: So human rights are always part of the discussions in every single relationship we have around the world. When we have engaged with our Egyptian partners in the past, it has always been high on the agenda. We have made the point to the Egyptians that improvements when it comes to issues of human rights only serve to strengthen the basis of the bilateral relationship. I have no doubt that human rights will also feature in the discussions leading up to COP between senior U.S. and Egyptian officials, and while the U.S. delegation is on the ground in Egypt.\n\nQUESTION: Can we stay on human rights just for a second?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: So, as you know, the Secretary and the President are headed to Cambodia this weekend. Back in August when he was there, the Secretary raised with Prime Minister Hun Sen the case of this Cambodian American human rights activist whos been jailed, Theary Seng. At the time, he and you both said that she should be freed, as should others who have been unjustly detained. Has there been a determination that she has that she is wrongfully detained in Cambodia and her case been moved from purely consular also to the SPEHA office, or not? And if not, why not?\n\nMR PRICE: So, Im not aware that there has been any change in categorization of her case. You are right that the Secretary did raise Theary Seng with Hun Sen in Cambodia in August. We routinely raise cases of detained Americans. When a U.S. citizen is arrested anywhere, we closely monitor the case, we provide all appropriate consular assistance. Thats what were doing in this case. We are providing Theary Seng and her family every form of appropriate assistance that we can. Were aware that she has initiated a hunger strike. Weve been in touch with her and her representatives. Were, again, providing every appropriate service.\n\nWhen it comes to how we categorize any individual whos detained, around the world any American whos detained around the world, this is a process that doesnt have an ending. We never come to a final determination that someone is not wrongfully detained. We are always looking at the information that is available to us to paint the full picture of the totality of the circumstances of a case. Whether a person is deemed to be detained wrongfully or not, we still have an obligation that we fulfill to provide all appropriate consular assistance to that individual and his or her family.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But the point is, is that both you and the Secretary, as well as Samantha Power and Uzra Zeya, all referred to her as unjustly detained previously and that you no longer are you saying that theres some difference between unjustly detained and wrongfully detained?\n\nMR PRICE: If the question youre asking is about the formal process of classifying someone as a wrongful detainee, the process thats laid out in the Levinson Act and a policy\n\nQUESTION: Yes. I think the argument is that her incarceration meets the criteria in the Levinson Act, and if it doesnt, why not? And, also, if it doesnt, why would you refer to her as being unjustly detained before and now not?\n\nMR PRICE: There has been no effort to change our language on this case. We are always looking\n\nQUESTION: Well, can you say that she is today, can you say that we call on the Cambodian authorities to release her, that she has been unjustly detained?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve engaged very closely, including at high levels, with Cambodian authorities. Thats why Secretary Blinken raised it with Hun Sen when we were in Phnom Penh, in August. But were always looking at the totality of circumstances of any particular case. But whether an individual is detained wrongfully or whether an individual is just detained, we provide every appropriate service to that individual and their family.\n\nQUESTION: So, you cant say today that you think that she was unjustly detained?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not in a position to say that.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Why can you say why, if you had said it before?\n\nMR PRICE: Im there has been no effort to shift\n\nQUESTION: Well, there obviously has been, because you used that language before and now youre refusing to. So there obviously has been an effort to shift it, and Im just wondering why.\n\nMR PRICE: There\n\nQUESTION: I dont know, maybe\n\nMR PRICE: To the best of my knowledge, there has not been any change in the status of her case.\n\nQUESTION: Well, then then why would you drop that word, that adverb, from the from the lines that you\n\nMR PRICE: I would have to go back and look at precisely what youre referring to, but there, to the best of my knowledge, has been no change in the status of her case.\n\nQUESTION: Lastly, do you expect this will be raised by either the Secretary or I know you cant speak for the President, but do you expect it to be raised by U.S. officials during the meetings in Phnom Penh?\n\nMR PRICE: I wont speak for the White House, but this is a case that we routinely raise at senior levels, and that will continue.\n\nLet me take a final question, so yes.\n\nQUESTION: Last week, NSC Spokesperson John Kirby said North Korea was trying to send ammunition to Russia. And on last Friday, there was a report that the train was crossing from North Korea to Russia. Have you seen any indication that the train could be a secret shipment from North Korea to Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not in a position to speak in any granular detail about our any information we have pertaining to that particular shipment. What we are aware of reports of resumed rail traffic between Russia and the DPRK. We continue to track this issue very closely. What is true is that multiple UN Security Council resolutions prohibit UN member-states from procuring from the DPRK all arms and related material. The UN Security Council imposed this prohibition over a decade ago in response to the DPRKs illicit WMD and ballistic missile program.\n\nSo, it is an effort its a program that we continue to watch very closely. We did declassify last week that the DPRK was seeking to supply Russia with needed security assistance, attempting to disguise those shipments by laundering them through third countries. But Im just not in a position to speak to this particular rail shipment.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, just before you go\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just point out this is what you said on June 15th in a statement, a written statement and I wanted to pull it up so that I had it right and I could quote it a hundred percent. June 15th, 2022, your in your name: \"We call on Cambodian authorities to release all those unjustly detained, including Theary Seng, and protect freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, consistent with Cambodias constitution and its international obligations and commitments.\"\n\nSo, I dont see how you can say that there hasnt been a concerted effort or action to change that determination. Because you wont say it today, but yet you had no problem you and the Secretary and the others that I mentioned back in June. And\n\nMR PRICE: Well see if we can get you more details.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Thanks.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:14 p.m.)",

                "cc_text": "It is an extraordinary development, but according to many analysts it is a simple factfor the first time, Iran is involved in a major war on the European continent.\n\nBacking the claim that Iranian military advisors, most likely members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), are on the ground in occupied Ukraineand possibly Belarusto help Russia deploy Iranian kamikaze drones in strikes against Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure, two analysts at the Washington, DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies also suggested that Iran is now preparing to up the ante by providing Russia not only with potentially thousands of additional drones but also with two types of Iranian-made ballistic missiles.\n\nWith Irans droneswrite John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia programme at the Foundation, and Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation, in a Foreign Policy piece headlined \"Iran is Now at War with Ukraine\" having helped Russia redress battlefield weaknesses hampering its eight-month war against Ukraine and conserve some of its dwindling missile stock, Tehran, looks set to provide Moscow not only with more Shahed-136 loitering munition drones and other drones, but also Fateh-110 and Zulfiqar short-range ballistic missiles. These single-stage, solid-propellant, road-mobile ballistic missiles are, said the analysts, among the most precise in Irans ballistic missile arsenal, the largest in the Middle East.\n\n\"That Tehran and Moscow would cooperate this closely in Ukraine caught many observersincluding some leading Russian experts on Iranby surprise,\" observe Hardie and Taleblu at the Foundation, a non-partisan group, but sometimes described as hawkish and neoconservative.\n\nThey add: \"Despite their recent alignment, Iran and Russia have a long history of enmity and mistrust going back to the tsarist era, including a series of Russo-Persian wars and frequent Russian meddling in Persian politics. During the Cold War, their relations were tense when Iran was led by the U.S.-allied shah and still worse after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Irans new regime dubbed the Soviet Union a Satan alongside the United States and backed the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets, just as Moscow aided Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq War.\n\n\"Relations later improved, with Russia providing assistance to Irans growing nuclear infrastructure and missile programs in the 1990s. But Moscow also earned Iranian mistrust when it waffled on major arms deals and assented to multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions sanctioning Iran over its growing nuclear program.\n\n\"Russo-Iranian relations have gained steam, however, since Vladimir Putins 2012 return to the Russian presidencyand particularly since his 2015 military intervention in Syria to save their common ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Although suspicion and competition remain, both sides increasingly see their interests as intertwined, driven by shared opposition to the West. A formal alliance isnt forthcoming, but that wont stop Russia and Iranalong with Chinafrom deepening their entente.\"\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei continues to move for stronger relations with Russia and China. With the Kremlins support, Iran last year obtained full membership in the Chinese- and Russian-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), while Tehran is also seeking membership in the so-called BRICS group and is in talks for a permanent free trade agreement with the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union (the EEU groups Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan).\n\n\"Viewed in this context, a deal to supply Russia with drones, missiles, and military advisors makes strategic sense for Iran and can demonstrate the latters value to one of its two senior partners in the anti-Western entente,\" add Hardie and Taleblu.\n\nTurning to the question of what, militarily, Iran may receive in return, the analysts suggest advanced Russian fighter aircraft or the S-400 air defence system, which Moscow has previously declined to sell to Tehran, could now be offered.\n\nWhile by fuelling the crisis in Ukraine, Iran likely hopes to lead the US to continue diverting its attention from the Middle East, \"ironically, Tehrans support for Russias war in Ukraine could prompt the West to pay more, not less, attention to the Middle East, especially if Europe now embraces a tougher line toward Iran\", note the analysts.\n\nWashington, they conclude, should work to ensure its Israeli and Arab allies, \"who have for years lived on the front lines of the Iranian drone and missile threat, have the military capabilities and support they need to counter Irans aggression\".",

                "cc_text": "Image At the International Military-Technical Forum in Moscow in August. Russia is the worlds second largest arms exporter after the United States. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times\n\nArms sales have long been an important part of Russian foreign policy. But those sales were declining before the invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say that the war will probably hasten the trend.\n\nRussias performance on the battlefield has damaged its reputation as a military power, they say, and financial and export controls by the U.S. and European governments will make it that much harder for the Kremlin to present itself as a reliable long-term arms supplier for future deals.\n\n\"I dont think Russia can recover as a major arms exporter from this,\" said Ian Storey, a political scientist at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore who studies security issues in Asia. \"Not for a long time, if ever.\"\n\nRussia is still the worlds second-largest arms exporter after the United States, and its sales of air defense systems and combat aircraft to China and Egypt its second- and third-largest clients after India have risen substantially in recent years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, known as SIPRI.\n\nBut from 2017 to 2021, Russias share of the global arms export market declined by 5 percent, to 19 percent, compared with the previous four-year period, according to SIPRI data. Its exports also fell by about a quarter, primarily because of decreasing demand from India and Vietnam.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine grinds on and sanctions against Russia increase, doubts are growing about the quality of Russian weapons, as well as Moscows capacity to produce advanced weapons and provide long-term support for clients who buy them, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms researcher at SIPRI.\n\n\"Russia just doesnt have the technology base or the economy to support development of many types of new weapons and components,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts say that Southeast Asia, where Russia has traditionally been the top arms supplier, is a useful case study in the Kremlins declining prospects as an arms exporter.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, South Korea eclipsed Russia as the regions top arms supplier, providing 18 percent of the regions arms imports, according to SIPRI data. No other exporter accounted for more than 14 percent.\n\nDuring that period, South Korea sent warships to the Philippines and Thailand, submarines to Indonesia, and combat and trainer aircraft to the Philippines and Thailand. Russia also lost a few potential deals. Indonesia canceled an order for 11 Russian fighter jets last year, buying American and French planes instead.\n\nFor many Southeast Asian nations, the United States is an increasingly attractive arms supplier because it links weapons purchases with military or diplomatic support against China, Mr. Wezeman said. Several European arms suppliers have been willing to help countries in the region develop their own arms industries and capabilities, in some cases through technology transfers, he added.\n\nAnother reason to avoid purchasing Russian arms is to signal a neutral position on the invasion of Ukraine, said John Parachini, a senior defense researcher at the RAND Corporation.\n\n\"Despite a likely aggressive Russian effort to market its arms exports in the Southeast Asia, they will find fewer customers,\" he said.\n\nOne exception might be Myanmar, where the ruling military junta, saddled with U.S. sanctions that limit its weapons purchases, has signaled a willingness to sign more arms deals with Russia. However, there are questions about whether the Kremlin would have the supplies to manufacture them.\n\nAnother could be Vietnam, Russias largest arms client in Southeast Asia. Because that countrys military arsenal has been built around Soviet and Russian weaponry for decades, adding weapons from new suppliers could create compatibility issues, said Ridzwan Rahmat, the principal defense analyst at Janes, based in Singapore.\n\nAt the same time, he added, Vietnam appears to be \"slowly shifting its orbit from Russian systems to a mix that includes NATO-compliant ones, although this will take decades.\"\n\nEven before the war, Vietnam was trying to diversify its arsenal by manufacturing its own guns and troop carriers and buying small amounts of weapons from India and Israel. The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnams military at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\n\"If we want to maintain some kind of deterrence capability toward China, the modernization has to speed up like 10 times faster,\" he said.",

It continues to expend its advanced long-range munitions against targets of limited operational importance.\n\nWith a range of over 2000km, basing KILLJOY in Belarus gives Russia little added advantage in terms of striking additional targets within Ukraine.

Simson indicated the EUs ability to rapidly provide all the spare parts Ukraine needs may be limited, but said that the 27-member bloc would do all it could to provide equipment. The need for spare parts is so big that there is no storage available to deliver them on the spot, she said.\"\n\nThe European Commission has prepared three financial support mechanisms for Ukraine, Ukraine Business News reports, citing Politico. \"The European Commission wants to attract up to 18B in loans and grants to cover half of Ukraines expected budget deficit of $38-40B in 2023.

But this time, national guarantees would need to cover 100% of the amount, instead of the 61% previously guaranteed, as \"there is no other budgetary cover\" left in the EU budget, the document says.

[] A Russian milblogger claimed [] that unsuccessful Ukrainian assaults from the direction of Kupiansk in the past weeks have cost Ukrainian forces significant equipment and manpower, which is forcing Ukrainian commanders to prepare for Russian counterattacks in the direction of Kupiansk. Another Russian milblogger claimed that it would be highly unlikely that Russian forces would be able to launch an offensive in the Kupiansk direction until late November or December. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces crossed the Zherebets River near Stelmakhivka (15km northwest of Svatove) and are preparing to resume an assault on Russian positions in the area. Russian sources claimed that Russian BARS (Combat Reserve) 13 and 16 detachments are currently defending areas in the Svatove direction. The BARS-13 commander reported that Ukrainian forces have increased their grouping in the Svatove direction and intend to take Svatove this week. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued to conduct counter-offensive operations in the direction of Kreminna on November 1. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces continue to conduct offensive operations in the direction of the Kreminna-Svatove highway. Another Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are preparing to conduct offensive operations toward Chervonopopivka to access Kreminna from the north. The milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna) intend to launch offensives that will cut off the highway between Kreminna and Svatove. Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces periodically launch counterattacks west of Kreminna near Terny (17km northwest of Kreminna) and Torske (15km west of Kreminna) to constrain the actions of Ukrainian forces in the direction of the highway. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully tried to assault Kreminna from the direction of Nevske (18km northwest of Kreminna). ISW cannot verify these Russian claims. The Luhansk Oblast Administration confirmed on November 1 that Ukrainian forces recaptured Nevske.[34] Southern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast) Russian forces continued defensive preparations in Kherson Oblast on November 1. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reported that Russian troops are continuing active defensive actions, conducting aerial reconnaissance, and forming defensive lines on the east bank (left) of the Dnipro River. Residents reported that Russian forces are digging trenches and settling in for the defense of the east bank, including along the Nova Kakhovka-Dnipryany-Korsunka line (on the east bank about 45km east of Kherson City), Hola Prystan (8km southwest of Kherson City) and as far south as Mykhailivka, which lies well into Russian-occupied territory about 45km south of Kherson City. Such reports indicate that Russian troops are preparing for protracted defensive operations on the east bank. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops continued counteroffensive operations in Kherson Oblast on November 1. Kherson occupation deputy Kirill Stremousov and other Russian sources claimed that Russian troops repelled an attempted Ukrainian attack in the direction of Beryslav. [] ISW cannot independently verify these Russian claims. Ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign against Russian concentration areas, logistics nodes, and military assets in Kherson Oblast []. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reported on October 31 that Ukrainian rocket and artillery units conducted 180 fire missions against Russian manpower and equipment concentrations in Kherson Oblast and that Ukrainian aviation struck a Russian stronghold in Snihurivka, Mykolaiv Oblast. Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Head Yaroslav Yanushevich stated that Ukrainian forces also hit Russian ammunition warehouses in Beryslav Raion. Social media users additionally reported explosions in Kozatske, near Nova Kakhovka, on November 1. Iran plans to send more combat drones and new ballistic missile systems to Russia for use in Ukraine, likely further strengthening Russias reliance on Iranian-made weapon systems. The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on November 1 that Iranian officials intend to send a shipment of more than 200 Shahed-136, Mohajer-6, and Arash-2 combat drones to Russia. The GUR reported that Iran will send Russia the drones in a disassembled state and that Russian personnel will assemble them with Russian markings. CNN reported on November 1 that unnamed officials from a western country that closely monitors Iranian weapons programs stated that Iran plans to send a thousand weapons to Russia by the end of the year, including surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles and combat drones. This would be the first confirmed instance of Iran sending Russia advanced precision-guided missiles. Russia likely negotiated the additional Iranian shipment of weapons systems due to the depletion of its stockpile of cruise missile and drone systems over the course of the war in Ukraine, particularly during the Russian campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. The GUR reported that Ukrainian air defenses have shot down more than 300 Shahed-136 drones since Russia starting using them in Ukraine on September 13. Russia will likely continue to use drone attacks and missile strikes against critical infrastructure to try to offset the failures and limitations of its conventional forces on the frontline. Russian dependence on Iranian-made systems, and therefore on Iran, will likely increase. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) started its semi-annual fall conscription drive on November 1, amidst reports of continuing covert mobilization throughout the country. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that 2,700 draft committees across 85 federal subjects began the fall conscription call-up of 120,000 men. Shoigu also stated that partial mobilization in Russia concluded. Head of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Directorate of the Russian General Staff [] reiterated that Russia is conscripting 7,500 fewer men than in previous years and noted that partial mobilization postponed the conscription cycle by one month. Burdinsky claimed that conscripts will not serve in occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, or Zaporizhzhia oblasts this year and will not participate in combat. Head of the 4th Directorate of the Main Organizational and Mobilization Directorate of the Russian General Staff Vladimir Tsimlyansky added that most recruits will deploy to training formations and military units where they will train for five months, while others will receive specializations based on their skills and education level. The Russian MoD has conducted semi-annual conscription call-ups for decades and should be able to execute this process effectively and efficiently. Any problems with the execution of the fall call-up would likely indicate that partial mobilization and the war in Ukraine have complicated a standard procedure. Numerous Russian sources reported that Russian enlistment officers are continuing to mobilize men despite Shoigus previous announcements of the conclusion of partial mobilization and transition into the conscription period on October 28. Local Russian outlets reported instances of men receiving mobilization notices in Tyumen and St. Petersburg as of October 31. The Russian Central Military District (CMD) reportedly told journalists of a Russian outlet that mobilization processes will continue across Russia until Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a decree ending the mobilization period. Ukrainian Melitopol and Mariupol authorities also reported that Russian occupation authorities are continuing to coerce Ukrainians into volunteer battalions and territorial defense units. Commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District (SMD) Lieutenant-General Andrey Mordvichev reportedly replaced Colonel-General Alexander Lapin as commander of the Central Military District (CMD). Several Russian milbloggersincluding some who appear on Russian state televisionnoted that Mordichev has replaced Lapin in this position, but the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) has not officially announced Mordichevs appointment nor Lapins dismissal as of November 1. A Russian local outlet citing an unnamed official within the Russian MoD claimed that Mordichev will only replace Lapin as the commander of the \"center\" forces in Ukraine for the duration of Lapins supposed three-week medical leave. A milblogger who frequently appears on Russian state media claimed that the Commander of the Russian Forces in Ukraine, Army General Sergey Surovikin, personally appointed Mordichev to replace Lapin due to his commitment to objective frontline reporting. If reports of Mordichevs appointment are true, then the Kremlin may be attempting to appease the pro-war milblogger community that has been demanding transparency and more honest reporting. The milblogger added that Mordichev reportedly has \"warm working relations\" with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, and that Kadyrov called Mordichev \"the best commander\" during their meeting in mid-March. Mordichevs appointment may therefore indicate that the Kremlin is attempting to appease the siloviki factioncomposed of Kadyrov and Wagner Group financier Yevgeniy Prigozhinthat has publicly criticized Lapin as well. Lapins dismissal may have also been Surovikins recommendation as well, however, given that both commanders operated in the Luhansk Oblast area to seize Lysychansk and its surroundings in June. ISW cannot independently verify milblogger or Russian local outlet reports at this time.

Poor Russian operational security has enabled Ukrainian partisan attacks. Russias increasing manpower shortages are likely degrading Russian forces ability to effectively secure Russian rear areas against partisan attacks and simultaneously defend against Ukrainian counteroffensives. The Kremlin still has not effectively countered Ukraines organized partisan movement and is unlikely to have the capabilities to do so.\"\n\nRussia plans to deploy Iranian-made missiles north of Ukraine, against which we have no defence Air Force spokesman, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraines Air Force. \"They will probably be delivered to the North of Ukraine; thats where they can be launched from, in such a way as to threaten the whole of Ukraine. One [of these types of] missile[s is] of 300 km [range]; another [type of] missile [is] 700 km in range. These are ballistic missiles. We have no effective defence against these missiles.\n\nIt is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but in fact it is very difficult to do it with the means we have at our disposal. We have anti-air defence, but not anti-missile defence.\"\n\nYurii Ihnat states that the Russians also want to purchase Iskander-M ballistic missiles from Iran, which are typically produced and deployed by Russian occupying forces. Ukraines Air Force spokesman explained that the Russians are running out of Iskander-Ms and have already begun to use up their emergency reserves of such missiles.\"\n\nRussian engineering troops arrive in Belarus to build barracks, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing the National Resistance Center. \"According to the Belarusian resistance group, Russian engineering troops are arriving in Belarus to build barracks and camps. It is noted that the work is being carried out as part of the creation of the so-called Russian-Belorusian combined force. The expected number of people in this military group is 20,000. Most of the barracks are planned to be built in Brest Oblast, located in a southwestern part of Belarus, which is where the Russian rear units arrive.\n\nAfter the statement of Alexander Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, about the creation of a joint military group with the Russian Federation, the Russian Armed Forces have taken complete control of the air bases in the cities of Baranovichi and Lida.\"\n\nConsequences and what to do?\n\nA gap between the financial contributions of Ukraines allies and its financial commitments complicates the state budget deficit, Ukraine Business News reports. \"The first quarter of 2023 is currently the most difficult challenge for Ukraine as far as covering the budget deficit due to the big difference between partners commitments to financial support and the necessary allocation of funds, said Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko. He specified that the vast difference between obligations and payments creates a problem with liquidity and a threat of further financing measures with regard to the state budget deficit by the National Bank of Ukraine. This provokes negative consequences for inflation, the exchange rate, and macro stability.\n\nIn April 2022, the Ukrainian government informed its international partners that the monthly deficit was $5B. But the financial assistance received was $1.7B in April, $1.5B in May, $4.4B in June, $1.7B in July, $4.7B in August, and about $2B in September.\"\n\nEnergy crisis chips away at Europes industrial might, Reuters reports. \"Europe needs its industrial companies to save energy amid soaring costs and shrinking supplies, and they are delivering demand for natural gas and electricity both fell in the past quarter. It is far too early to rejoice, though. The drop is not just because industrial companies are turning down thermostats, they are also shutting down plants that may never reopen. And while lower energy use helps Europe weather the crisis sparked by Russias war in Ukraine and Moscows supply cuts, executives, economists and industry groups warn its industrial base may end up severely weakened if high energy costs persist.\n\nEnergy-intensive industries, such as aluminium, fertilisers, and chemicals are at risk of companies permanently shifting production to locations where cheap energy abounds, such as the United States. Even as an unusually warm October and projections of a mild winter helped drive prices lower, natural gas in the United States still costs about a fifth what companies pay in Europe.\n\nA lot of companies are just quitting production,\" Patrick Lammers, management board member at utility E.ON told a conference in London last month. \"They actually demand destruct. That could lead to Europe de-industrialising very quickly, he added.\n\nEuro-zone this month hit its weakest level since May 2020, signaling Europe was heading for a recession.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates European industrial gas demand fell by 25% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Analysts say widespread shutdowns had to be behind the drop because efficiency gains alone would not produce such savings.\n\n\"We are doing all we can to prevent a reduction in industrial activity,\" an European Commission spokesperson said in an email.\n\nBut when the weather turns colder and households crank up heating, the industrial sector will be the first to face cuts in case of shortages, economists warn.\n\nEuropean industry has been shifting production to locations with cheaper labour and lower other costs for decades, but the energy crisis is accelerating the exodus, analysts said. []\n\nWestern efforts to secure supplies not just for energy but also for key minerals used in electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure are also at risk from high energy prices. [] The feared industrial erosion is already underway. Europe became a net importer of chemicals for the first time ever this year, according to Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council.\"\n\nHans Petter Midttun: During nearly 9 years of reporting, I have tried to conceptualise the Hybrid War and outline its consequences on both Ukraine and the EU and NATO member states. I have argued that the war most Western politicians and media outlets describe as a \"Russian- Ukrainian War\" is a Russian induced confrontation with the West. Ukraine is only a crucial object in its quest for Great Power status at the cost of the US, NATO and the EU. I have repeatedly stressed that NATO is already a part of a broader confrontation. I have consistently argued for humanitarian intervention in line with the Alliances previous strategic concept and the UN Responsible to Protect doctrine. The seven arguments in favour of intervention have been presented. I have also highlighted why we need to confront the Russian nuclear \"fait accompli strategy\". I do not buy into the Russian nuclear blackmail and have argued why. My concerns around the Wests ability to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs to defeat Russia has been raised. I have also discussed the challenges we are facing as NATO has been forced to reduce its level of ambitions and are stepping away from past commitments. The challenges the US and Europe defence industries are facing have also been flagged.\n\nI have not least, repeatedly stressed, the \"tsunami of ripple effects\" and argued that they will foster unrest, riots, and potential the collapse of governments. In my report on 26 July, I argued that:\n\n\"President Biden, Chancellor Scholz, President Macron, Prime Minister Stre, Frederiksen, Rutte, Snchez, Costa, Trudeau, and more, will likely be held responsible for the increasing costs of living and the lack of energy and food security, having failed to act resolutely when challenged. While Russia bears full responsibility for the war, NATOs failure to intervene in Ukraine has enabled a Russian protracted war with escalating global consequences.\n\nHaving failed to avert the global consequences of the war, the West also risks losing its global economic, diplomatic and military influence. Europe is facing a recession. Just as importantly, the prime guarantor of international law is seen to be failing to defend its core values and principles. At a time when global democracy has reached a new low when more than a third of the worlds population lives under authoritarian rule and just 6.4% enjoy full democracy, Western courage and moral obligations are seen to falter.\n\nThe world is watching a nuclear power deterring what was seen as the greatest military alliance in history. It serves as a lesson for more to follow.\n\n\"Only the lost is forever owned\". The West the USA, NATO and the EU is in principle faced with a similar \"now-or-never\" moment as Russia. We either succeed in Ukraine or accept losing global influence. If we are unable to stop a war in our own \"backyard\" and its consequential \"tsunami of ripple effects\" NATO will no longer be seen as a global military power. I fear that the potential consequences unrest, riots, and the possible collapse of governments might help accelerate our demise.\"\n\nWe have since seen the rise of right-wing political forces. Marine Le Pen was competing for the post of president of France while exploiting the protest potential of the population as a consequence of the rising costs of living. The Sweden Democrats a far-right political party recently did their best election ever. The far-right \"Brothers of Italy party\" claimed victory in Italys election a month ago. In Norway, the political parties in the government are presently facing the worst election support in years.\n\nThis happens in the face of a Russian energy and economic war that might potentially increase in scope and severity as winter approaches. The political landscape is slowly evolving as Europe is facing recession and the energy crisis chips away at Europes industrial might.\n\nAmazingly, all of this can be effectively countered by resolve, courage and humanitarian intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe political leaders should find the determination Ukraines Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi so eloquently framed following Russian mass missile strikes on Ukraines energy infrastructure on Monday:\n\n\"We are waging a war against a country whose size is 28 times larger than ours, whose population is 4 times larger than ours, and whose military capabilities are many times greater than ours. We are waging a war by land, air, sea, cyberspace, etc.\n\nWe have been at war not for 8 months, but for 8 years and 8 months. All this testifies to our resilience, courage to defend what is ours, and the will to win.\n\nWould other countries withstand such pressure? Just today, the enemy used 55 Kh-101 cruise missiles and one Kh-59 guided air missile, 22 anti-aircraft missiles for S-300 surface-to-air missile systems (SA-10 Grumble), 4 Shahed-136 UAVs and one Lancet-3 UAV on civilian targets in Ukraine. I dont know about others, but we are holding on, regrouping, building up reserves, strengthening the defence, and gradually liberating our homeland.\n\nVictory does not come easy to us. But it will definitely be ours.\"\n\nNATO and Ukraine have a population 7 times bigger than the aggressor. Its collective defence budget is 22 times bigger than Russia. The industrial base of the USA and the EU are many times bigger. Western weapons, sensors and intelligence have proven itself superior on the battlefield. The professionality of its Armed Forces is by far higher than what the Russian Armed Forces have demonstrated fighting the Ukraine.\n\nIf we only find inspiration from Ukrainian bravery, resilience and resolve, we will find the moral strength to do what is needed in Ukraine: Humanitarian intervention to change the military balance in favour of democracy, universal rights and international law.",

                "cc_text": "Washington CNN\n\nIran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, officials from a western country that closely monitors Irans weapons program told CNN.\n\nThe shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield.\n\nThe last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones.\n\nThis new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russias war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones are known as a \"loitering munition\" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets.\n\nSending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is not going to \"waste our time\" on talks to revive the nuclear deal \"if nothings going to happen.\" Tehrans support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on nationwide protests prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September have prompted the US to impose further sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehrans direct engagement in the conflict.\n\n\"We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,\" Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nMalley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday.\n\n\"We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that its happening,\" Malley said.\n\nOn Monday a senior US defense official said they didnt have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has \"concerns\" that Russia may \"seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,\" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,\" Ryder said.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraines Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has \"no effective defense against these (surface-to-surface) missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have.\"\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it \"has not and will not\" do so.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report Irans plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia.\n\nThe US is \"looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions\" in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is \"trying to break up these networks.\"\n\nBut it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia.\n\nUS officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered.\n\nLast month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to \"target producers and procurers\" contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Departments Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said.\n\nThe question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry including more advanced missiles to Russia.",

Yasuyoshi Chiba | AFP | Getty Images\n\nUkraine is at risk of running out of air defense weapons and needs urgent help from the West to defend itself, analysts at the Royal United Services Institute said Monday. Russia has bombarded the country over recent weeks with a tide of cheap Iran-supplied drones which are destroying the country's energy infrastructure. \"The West must avoid complacency about the need to urgently bolster Ukrainian air-defence capacity,\" defense and security think tank RUSI said. Moscow and Tehran have denied that there is a deal for Iran to supply Russia a country with limited supply options due to international sanctions with weapons. However, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time Saturday that it had sent a number of drones to Russia, but insisted this was before Russia invaded Ukraine. The U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley rejected that claim, saying Tehran supplied drones to Russia in the summer. RUSI analysts Justin Bronk, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds published their new report on Ukraine's air defenses as Russia increasingly relies on Iranian Shahed-136 drones to disable Ukraine's energy networks.\n\nLocal residents look at parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle, what Ukrainian authorities consider to be an Iranian-made drone Shahed-136, after a Russian drone strike in Kyiv on Oct. 17, 2022. Vladyslav Musiienko | Reuters\n\n\"If Ukrainian SAMs [surface-to-air missile systems] are not resupplied with ammunition, and ultimately augmented and replaced with Western equivalents over time, Russian Aerospace Forces [the VKS] will regain the ability to pose a major threat,\" the analysts said. On Sunday night, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the Iranian regime was helping Russia prolong the war, saying \"if it was not for the Iranian supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now.\" He also warned that Russia needed Iranian missiles for a \"possible repetition of mass attacks on our infrastructure.\" For its part, Ukraine continues to plead for more air defense weapons to help it combat Russian drone and missile attacks. RUSI's analysts agree that Ukraine requires urgent assistance to ensure that \"Kyiv can counter Moscow's updated approach to the air war in Ukraine.\"\n\nStrategic air attacks\n\nIn the early months of the war against Ukraine, Russia's attempts at strategic air attacks were limited to expensive cruise and ballistic missile barrages and were on a much more limited scale, RUSI's experts said, noting that \"these failed to achieve strategically decisive damage during the first seven months of the invasion.\" In the last few months, however, Russia has deployed hundreds of explosive-carrying drones supplied by Iran that have been used to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, depriving hundreds of thousands of people of water and electricity as colder temperatures set in. Essentially propeller-powered missiles, these drones are cheap to buy; reports suggest they cost around $20,000 per unit, compared with a cruise missile that can cost several million dollars. Also, while they aren't able to perform sophisticated maneuvers and contain smaller quantities of explosives to conventional missiles, they can be sent in \"swarms\" to loiter above their target and are harder for radar systems to detect. Images showed Kyiv's police attempting to shoot down drones during an attack last month that targeted residential buildings and energy facilities.\n\nA police officer fires at a flying drone following attacks in Kyiv on October 17, 2022. Yasuyoshi Chiba | AFP | Getty Images\n\nRUSI's defense analysts said the use of Iranian drones had changed the character of Russia's air attack strategy, noting that the latest iteration \"is a more focused and sustainable bombardment of the Ukrainian electricity grid, blending hundreds of cheap Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 loitering munitions against substations with continued use of cruise and ballistic missiles against larger targets.\"\n\nWhat Ukraine needs",

                "cc_text": "For centuries, Russia has seen itself as one of the worlds great powers. This superpower status was somewhat sullied by the humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse, but post-Soviet Russia has worked hard under Vladimir Putin to reclaim its position among the leading nations on the global stage. During the first two decades of his reign, Putin won plaudits for rebuilding Russias military and economic might, and was credited with returning the country to the top table of international affairs. However, his disastrous invasion of Ukraine has now done much to reverse this progress by exposing the deep dysfunction and hollow boasts that lie behind the facade of Russias superpower pretensions.\n\nRussias weakness has not come as a total surprise. Ever since the fall of the USSR, Western commentators have noted the debilitating impact of corruption at every level of the modern Russian state. In recent decades, some have branded the Putin regime a \"mafia state,\" where the boundaries between the authorities and organized crime are blurred.\n\nCorruption has flourished under Putin amid a climate of stagnation inherited from the late Soviet era. Unlike Ukraine, post-Soviet Russia has never undergone de-communization or acknowledged the need to reject the Soviet legacy. Instead, Putin has rehabilitated the Soviet era and placed the Red Armys role in the defeat of Nazi Germany at the heart of his vision for a modern Russian national identity. Efforts to honor the memory of Stalins victims have been silenced and attempts to acknowledge the crimes of the USSR drowned out by a victory cult that has elevated the Soviet World War II experience to the level of religious cult and re-established Josef Stalin as a national hero. In 2020, Putin condemned Russians to a further sixteen years of stagnation when he staged a referendum on constitutional reforms that made it possible to extend his reign until 2036.\n\nFrom politics to the economy, the consequences of widespread corruption and stagnation can be seen throughout Russian society. Crucially, this negative impact is also highly visible in the invasion of Ukraine. Whereas Ukrainian troops have repeatedly demonstrated the kind of initiative and leadership that one would expect from a society shaped by two post-Soviet pro-democracy revolutions, the Russian military remains hamstrung by a deeply hierarchical system and rigid chain of command.\n\nOn the eve of this years invasion, the Russian military was widely touted as the worlds number two army, but such claims have been brutally debunked by subsequent events in Ukraine. Putins army has been exposed in almost every department, from poor leadership and outdated tactics to equally out-of-date equipment. Chronic corruption within the Russian Ministry of Defense has hampered military logistics, with soldiers in many instances receiving kit dating from the 1970s or earlier. It has also become painfully obvious that many of the vehicles and weapons listed as part of the vast Russian arsenal exist on paper only. With the war now in its ninth month, chronic supply problems mean that Russia is now increasingly reliant on Iran for drones that it is unable to produce itself.\n\nThese shortcomings have highlighted the cosmetic nature of the much-vaunted military reforms carried out by Russia over the past two decades. In reality, the Russian army under Putin remains largely a Soviet relic with a distinctively Soviet political culture that allows Russian commanders to treat soldiers with contempt. This lack of consideration for troops has been particularly evident in the treatment of recently mobilized Russians, many of whom have been sent to the front in Ukraine with minimal training and inadequate equipment.\n\nThe human price of Russias military failures in Ukraine has been exceptionally high. An estimated 70,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during the first eight months of the invasion, according to the latest Ukrainian Ministry of Defense data. While this figure is disputed, even the most conservative independent analysis indicates tens of thousands of Russian casualties. This makes the invasion of Ukraine far deadlier than the nine-year Soviet campaign in Afghanistan, which resulted in the loss of 15,000 Soviet troops and has been widely cited as a contributing factor in the collapse of the USSR.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has also revealed other areas where todays Russia falls well short of superpower status. Unlike China and other rising powers, Russia has never diversified or modernized its economy. Instead, the countrys ruling elites have prioritized the accumulation of staggering personal fortunes. As a result, todays Russia remains heavily dependent on commodities exports and has no technological equivalent of Chinas Huawei or South Koreas Samsung. With sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine restricting access to a range of cutting-edge tech, Russia has struggled to produce sophisticated weapons and has in some instances reportedly resorted to cannibalizing elements of household appliances.\n\nRussias excessive economic reliance on the export of energy and arms now looks to have been even more of a strategic blunder as international demand plummets due to the invasion of Ukraine. The EU has weaned itself off Russian gas earlier than expected and will enter 2023 with a high degree of independence from the Kremlins energy blackmail. With European customers turning away from Russian energy, Moscow will struggle to find sufficient alternative buyers for gas in the coming year as Russia has not invested in LNG.\n\nMeanwhile, Russias defense industry also faces bleak prospects. The often abysmal performance of the Russian military in Ukraine has been a PR disaster for Russian arms exporters, who must now explain why their products are so technologically inferior. Numerous traditional clients have already cancelled weapons contracts. More are expected to follow suit.\n\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, Russia has become something of an international pariah. The entire Western world has condemned Moscows actions while even traditional allies such as China and India have offered muted criticism. Only a handful of fellow pariahs such as Syria, North Korea, and Nicaragua have been prepared to stand with Russia and back Moscow at the United Nations. In the former Soviet region, only Belarus has voted with Russia at the UN.\n\nThis international isolation has highlighted the fundamental weakness of Russias geopolitical position and the absence of any meaningful message behind Moscows anti-Western posturing. Putins attempts to position Russia as a champion of traditional values have failed to resonate. In reality, abortion, divorce, suicide, and alcoholism rates are all significantly higher in Russia than in most European countries. Russians have a far shorter life expectancy and are poorer on average than their European neighbors. This poverty is reflected in the mass plundering of household goods from Ukrainian homes, with Russian soldiers stealing everything from washing machines to used underwear.\n\nThe war has also revealed the limitations of Russian soft power, with Western audiences in particular overwhelmingly rejecting Russian attempts to justify the invasion. Even in regions with strong historic links to Russia such as the the South Caucasus and Central Asia, audiences have treated Kremlin narratives with deep distrust.\n\nDespite massive investment in media operations, the invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of Kremlin disinformation. In the West, Moscow has largely been preaching to the converted and has failed to move beyond a minority audience driven primarily by anti-Americanism and conspiratorial thinking. The picture is similar in the political sphere. As the recent election of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has shown, Russian support for right-wing populists and nationalists has not led to any major breakthroughs in European politics.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has ruthlessly revealed Putins Russia as a Potemkin Great Power. Like the Potemkin villages erected along the banks of Ukraines Dnipro River in the late eighteenth century to impress visiting Russian Empress Katherine the Great, Russias much-hyped revival under Putin is in fact a masterly facade designed to disguise a far less impressive reality. This illusion has now been shattered by the harsh realities of Europes largest armed conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia is heading toward an historic defeat in Ukraine that will have profound ramifications for the way Russians view their state and themselves. Defeat in Ukraine will undermine the imperial identity that defines Putins Russia. It will force the Russian public to belatedly confront decades of nationalistic myth-making by their own rapacious elites. It is still far too early to predict what kind of Russia will emerge from the wreckage of Putins Ukraine invasion, but it already looks unlikely that anyone will continue to view the country as one of the worlds superpowers.\n\nTaras Kuzio is a professor of political science at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy and author of the forthcoming book \"Fascism and Genocide.

We will look at additional tools and authorities that we may be able to call upon to counter this activity,\" he said.\n\n[1/2]White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby addresses the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S. October 26, 2022. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nThe United States in September imposed sanctions on an Iranian company it accused of coordinating military flights to transport Iranian drones to Russia and three other companies it said were involved in the production of Iranian drones.\n\nKirby said the amount of shells was not insignificant, but was unlikely to change the momentum or outcome of the war. However, they could still be deadly for Ukrainians, he said.\n\n\"And it's certainly not going to change our calculus ... or with so many of our allies and partners about the kinds of capabilities we're going to continue to provide the Ukrainians,\" he said.\n\nKirby said the North Korean shipments were a sign not only of Pyongyang's willingness to support Russia but of Moscow's munitions shortages brought on by U.S.-led sanctions and export controls.\n\nNorth Korea in September said it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so, while warning the United States to \"keep its mouth shut\" and stop circulating rumors aimed at \"tarnishing\" the country's image.\n\nReferring to North Korea missile launches on Wednesday, Kirby said they did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel in the region, and added that the United States would make sure it had the capabilities there to defend its allies.\n\nNorth Korea fired at least 23 missiles into the sea on Wednesday, including one that landed less than 60 km (40 miles) off South Korea's coast, which the South's President Yoon Suk-yeol described as \"territorial encroachment.\"\n\nIt was the first time a ballistic missile had landed near the South's waters since the peninsula was divided in 1945, and the most missiles fired by the North in a single day. South Korea issued rare air raid warnings and launched its own missiles in response.\n\nReporting by David Brunnstrom, Idrees Ali and Susan Heavey; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis and Daphne Psaledakis; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Mark Porter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The Kremlin has said it will rejoin the UN-administered grain export corridor from Ukraine after pulling out over the weekend after a drone attack on Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol. Moscows humiliating climbdown came two days after a large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russias warnings that it would be \"unsafe\" without its participation, and after high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey one of the guarantors of the scheme with the UN and Russia. Russias withdrawal had reignited fears over global hunger and food prices that had been alleviated by the inauguration of the scheme earlier this year which allowed cargo ships to move Ukrainian gain without fear of being targeted. Confirming Turkish reports that Moscow would be lifting its suspension, the Russian defence ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. \"The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\" the ministry statement said.

Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820 feet) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was \"destroyed\", according to Agence French-Presse (AFP). Four leaks emerged on Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 after what seismic experts suggested were underwater explosions. Swedish inspectors found evidence of sabotage during their investigation, which Russia has attempted to blame on the UK in recent days. The pipelines, which connect Russia to Germany, have been at the centre of geopolitical tensions as Russia cut gas supplies to Europe in suspected retaliation to Western sanctions over Moscows invasion of Ukraine.\n\n2 Nov 2022 13.25 EDT The Hromadske International news organisation in Ukraine has reported that police have uncovered 34 torture chambers and prisons in the Sumy, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions.

The theatre reopened to a production of an adaptation of George Orwells famous novel, 1984. Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images While the air raid sirens continue to be a fixture of life in Kyiv, life is continuing, including rehearsals and performances at theatres in the city. A reporter for Al Jazeera has spoken to actors at the Theatre on Podil in the Ukrainian capital, as they ran through their lines before the curtain gets raised. \"In one moment,\" actor Mykhailo Kryshtal said, \"a rocket could land near you and everything could come to an end. These factors arent helping.\" \"The fact that we are still performing for our audience is resistance itself,\" says Kryshtal. \"Because we are not afraid. We didnt run away.\" The theatre shut as the invasion began, and only reopened in June. The production is of The Emigrants, a 1970s Polish drama. Productions often get interrupted by air raid sirens, causing performers and the audience to gather in the lobby. Director Volodymyr Kudlinsky said: \"We were surprised that the audiences who stayed in Kyiv started to buy tickets and came to the performances for the same prices as before the war,\" he says. \"People were ready. Through buying tickets, they supported us and theatre itself, the city and the country.\"\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.56 EDT Authorities in Kyiv have begun shutting down the Ukrainian capitals power network, after a supply in consumption, Reuters reports. The administration said in a statement that the move was necessary to \"avoid major accidents with power equipment\". Russian drone and missile attacks have badly damaged the electricity grid in and around the capital.\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.25 EDT Switzerland has introduced sanctions against an Iranian firm and three army members after the country sold drones to Russia as part of its war effort in Ukraine. It follows the European Union taking similar steps in October. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian government claimed that Iran was due to send another 200 combat drones in addition to those that have already been provided. Shahed Aviation Industries, along with three men, Maj Gen Mohammed Hossein Bagheri, Gen Syed Hojatollah Qureishi and Brig Gen Syed Aghajani have been given travel bans and had their assets frozen. The Swiss government has so far refused to follow the EU line on sanctions with Iran. It has not introduced them in response to the Iranian governments handling of protests after the death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nUpdated at 12.31 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.03 EDT Passenger numbers on Russian airlines were down 20% in September compared to last year, as the impact of western sanctions continues to weigh on the industry. Russian airlines carried 9.87 million passengers in September, Russias statistics agency Rosstat said on Wednesday, down a fifth from September 2021. Western countries banned Russian airlines from using their airspace in response to Moscow sending its armed forces into Ukraine in February, cutting them off from lucrative routes to Europe and the United States. Aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have also stopped selling planes, parts and equipment to Russian airlines, forcing some companies to cannibalise existing jets to get hold of spare parts, Reuters reports. Traffic for the entire first nine months of the year was down 13.1% to 72.6 million passengers, Rosstat said.\n\nUpdated at 12.03 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.00 EDT Summary of the day so far As it has just gone 6pm in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, here is a roundup of todays news so far. The Kremlin has said it will rejoin the UN-administered grain export corridor from Ukraine, after pulling out over the weekend following a drone attack on Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol.\n\nMoscows humiliating climbdown came two days after a large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russias warnings that it would be unsafe without its participation , and after high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey one of the guarantors of the scheme with the UN and Russia.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia . \"The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\" the ministry statement said.\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, will be seen as having successfully called the Russians bluff to blockade Ukrainian ports or even sink civilian cargo ships carrying grain abroad . The Turkish leader had said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown.\n\nSeparately, Moscow said it would summon the UK ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, over its accusation that \"British specialists\" were involved in the Sevastopol attack. Russia has, without providing evidence, repeatedly blamed the UK for Saturdays audacious attack, in which a swarm of drones attacked Russias Black Sea fleet.\n\nThe governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, told Ukraines Hromadske TV that Kyiv region is once again becoming an \"outpost\" in Russias strategy to target the capital. Earlier Kuleba gave an update on the energy situation in the region on the Telegram messaging service, saying 16,000 homes remain without electricity.\n\nRussian security services in Crimea claim to have foiled a plot to sabotage energy supplies in the region by Ukraines security service and have detained a man over it.\n\nRussia has said it is fully committed to preventing nuclear war , and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons is its highest priority. In a statement, the countrys foreign ministry said: \"In implementing its policy on nuclear deterrence Russia is strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"\n\nPoland will build a razor-wire fence on its border with Russias Kaliningrad exclave, its defence minister said on Wednesday.

Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were \"known to be business associates\" of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list.\n\nUpdated at 12.06 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 11.07 EDT The US has information that indicates North Korea is secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells, according to the White House spokesperson, John Kirby. Kirby, who specialises in national security, told a virtual briefing that North Korea was trying to hide the shipments by funnelling them through the Middle East and North Africa. \"Our indications are that the DPRK is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,\" Kirby said, according to Reuters, adding that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments. \"It is not an insignificant number of shells, but we dont believe they are in such a quantity that they would change the momentum of the war,\" he said. \"And its certainly not going to change our calculus ... or with so many of our allies and partners about the kinds of capabilities were going to continue to provide the Ukrainians.\" North Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so, while warning the US to \"keep its mouth shut\" and stop circulating rumours aimed at \"tarnishing\" the countrys image.\n\nUpdated at 11.16 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 10.47 EDT Putin: Russia reserves right to withdraw from grain deal again if Kyiv breaks guarantees The Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken about the resumption of his nations participation in the Black Sea grain deal, saying Russia reserved the right to withdraw again if guarantees they had received were not kept. The Russian Interfax news agency quotes Putin saying: We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like [the Sevastopol attack] will happen in the future, that humanitarian corridors will not be used for military purposes. Information has been received through the Ministry of Defence from the Turkish side that such assurances have been given by Ukraine that these humanitarian corridors will not be used for military purposes. In this regard, I have given instructions to the Ministry of Defence to resume our full participation in this work. At the same time, Russia reserves the right to withdraw from these agreements if these guarantees are violated by Ukraine.

In a statement, the countrys foreign ministry said: \"In implementing its policy on nuclear deterrence Russia is strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Russian doctrinal approaches in this sphere are defined with utmost accuracy, pursue solely defensive goals and do not admit of expansive interpretation. \"We fully reaffirm our commitment to the joint statement of the five nuclear-weapon states leaders on the prevention of nuclear war and the avoidance of an arms race from 3 January. \"We are strongly convinced that in the current complicated and turbulent situation, caused by irresponsible and impudent actions aimed at undermining our national security, the most immediate task is to avoid any military clash of nuclear powers.\" It follows the permanent members of the UNs security council, who have nuclear arsenals, releasing a joint-pledge at the turn of the year which agreed \"a nuclear war cannot be won\". On Wednesday the New York Times reported that senior Russian military leaders had discussed when and how Moscow might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, according to multiple senior US officials. They said that the Biden administration was alarmed, as the news \"showed how frustrated Russian generals were about their failures on the ground, and suggests that Mr Putins veiled threats to use nuclear weapons might not just be words\".\n\nUpdated at 10.45 EDT",

                "cc_text": "As Russia suffers mounting setbacks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, a helping hand arrived from Iran. According to Ukrainian, US and EU sources, the Islamic Republic has supplied Russia with low-cost, low-flying Shahed-136 drones that pose, as The Economist put it, a fiendish military problem for Ukraine: launched in large volleys, they penetrate Ukrainian air defences, kill civilians and cause destruction of civilian infrastructure. In addition, Iranian trainers are claimed to be deployed in the Russian-occupied Crimea assisting Russian forces in their use of the drones. Thus, Iran is directly assisting Russias war and current aims to demoralise the Ukrainian population and undermine its will to resist.\n\nThe US and EU imposed fresh sanctions on individuals and entities in Iran involved in the supply of drones to Russia. Ukraine announced its intention to severe diplomatic relations with Iran. Lithuanias foreign minister, using somewhat colourful language, called for new sanctions against Iran. While US intelligence, having correctly predicted the supply of drones in the summer, now warns that Iran could also deliver ballistic missiles to help Russia to replenish its rapidly depleting stock. That would further escalate Irans engagement in the war and increase pressure to counteract it.\n\nTehran remains unfazed in the face of this mounting outrage. The permanent representation of Iran to the UN denied the supplies, which was mocked even by some Iranian conservative analysts. A mutual understanding might have developed between Moscow and Tehran: for Moscow to admit that it is performing so badly that it is forced to rely on Iran would be embarrassing; while for Tehran some distance would be useful as the majority of Iranians support Ukraine, not their old imperial adversary Russia. Yet the rulers of the Islamic Republic have evidently decided that the benefits of allying with Russia outweigh the costs.\n\nThe future is in the East\n\nSuch a view is rooted in the general outlook of the currently dominant conservative, hard-line faction In Tehran: The West is declining, as epitomised by the US humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan and mounting economic difficulties in western democracies. The East, by contrast, is rising, with a new multipolar world emerging in Eurasia under the leadership of Russia and China. In this reading, Iran has been tricked by the world powers through the JCPOA (the nuclear agreement) to give up its leverage while not obtaining the promised sanctions relief that would have refloated its economy. Even as the Biden administration, together with its European allies, tried to revive the pact, any economic benefits to Iran would have been ephemeral as a new Republican president would renege on the deal anyway, possibly as soon as 2025. In fact, hopeful Republicans have made it abundantly clear that they would do exactly that. Seen from this perspective, it made scarce sense for Tehran to roll back its nuclear advances and associated leverage in exchange for uncertain and short-lived economic relief.\n\nThese calculations underpinned the look to East foreign policy doctrine adopted by the conservative Ebrahim Raisi administration. Irans full integration into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), made official at the summit in Samarqand (Uzbekistan) in September 2022, stands as a tangible deliverable of this policy.\n\nThe supply of drones and possibly missiles in the near future is also part of Irans own deterrence strategy: the demonstrative effect of the havoc Irans weaponry can wreck is intended as a message to its regional enemies.\n\nNeither the pro-East orientation nor SCO membership in themselves, however, determined Irans active military support for Russia. After all, most members of the SCO, particularly the Central Asian states and India, showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Putins adventurism. Unlike these countries, however, Iran is isolated from the West, which makes it more eager to stick with Russia in the expectation of security and economic benefits. The fact that Moscow and Tehran are converging in their ideological opposition to what they see as the US-led hegemonic world order is fuelling this alliance of expedience.\n\nHaving betted on Russia, it is now imperative for Tehran to avoid that it loses the war in Ukraine. But the supply of drones and possibly missiles in the near future is also part of Irans own deterrence strategy: the demonstrative effect of the havoc Irans weaponry can wreck is intended as a message to its regional enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, but also Iraqi Kurdistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, in fact any regional entity thought to enable Tehrans enemies.\n\nDomestic turmoil\n\nThe domestic unrest triggered by the murder of the young woman Mahsa Amini by the so-called morality police has further incentivised the regime to dissuade its regional adversaries from attempting to pressure Tehran in its moment of weakness. Displaying Iranian drone and missile capabilities is a way of showing that the countrys defence was in no way compromised by the domestic turmoil in addition to the strikes in Iraqi Kurdistan which were designed to convey the same message.\n\nThe regime in Tehran sees little downsides in pursuing this strategy. It is not concerned that assisting an aggressor Russia undermines its own long-held narrative of the Islamic Republic as a victim of Saddam Husseins aggression in 1980s. The rulers in Tehran appear to have concluded that the perceived benefits of an alliance with Russia outweigh any moral high ground, for which they feel Tehran was never rewarded anyway.\n\nThe potential definitive death of the JCPOA also doesnt seem to be a major factor in Tehrans decision-making process. Even as Iranian diplomats try to project an impression that the United States and its allies are desperately seeking to revive the accord, it is difficult to imagine the West showering the regime with billions in sanctions relief as long as it is deepening its war alliance with Russia. And the demise of the JCPOA is seen by the hard-line faction as unchaining Irans progress towards the nuclear bomb the ultimate deterrent. It was under the influence of these factions that Tehran missed an opportunity to clinch the deal in August.\n\nWhile the current protests were triggered by cultural restrictions, especially on women, previous bout of mass unrest, in 2019, was provoked by the dire socio-economic conditions of the lower classes.\n\nThe threat of new crippling sanctions, as voiced by the Lithuanian foreign minister, is also unlikely to act as a deterrent. By failing to make the original JCPOA create significant economic relations with Iran, the West has already sanctioned itself out of any leverage over Tehran.\n\nAs the latest protests have shown, however, the regime faces significant domestic vulnerabilities. While these protests were triggered by cultural restrictions, especially on women, previous bout of mass unrest, in 2019, was provoked by the dire socio-economic conditions of the lower classes. Different strands of discontent socio-economic, cultural and political may yet coalesce into a potent opposition movement. It will be far more radical in its demands than the timid reformist trend that sought an evolution within the framework of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe regimes response might include some measure of cultural liberalisation, such as the relaxation of dress codes for women, if not an abolition of the mandatory hijab altogether, especially if the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) gain even more political prominence at the expense of the clerics. That, however, may be too little, too late as the demise of the JCPOA would deprive the regime of the means to rapidly improve the economic situation. Increased ties with Russia another heavily sanctioned country will not compensate for the loss of opportunities and income associated with the death of the JCPOA. The alliance with Russia may be expedient for the Iranian regime from a narrow security point of view, but it may yet prove to be a strategic disaster in a longer term.\n\nThis article reflects the personal views of the author and not necessarily the opinions of the S&D Group or the European Parliament.",

                "cc_text": "If Moscow were to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, how would Beijing and New Delhi react?\n\nSince Russia began its assault on Ukraine last February, India and China have straddled the fence by hinting at their concerns regarding the wars global fallout while avoiding direct public criticism of Moscow. Despite rhetorical consternation and calls for a peaceful resolution, neither has shown a willingness to meaningfully push back against Putins escalations in Ukraine. Instead, the two Asian nuclear powers are approaching the situation with caution and calculated diplomacy to preserve their own strategic interests both in Russia and the West.\n\nHowever, Putins nuclear brinksmanship is putting Beijing's and New Delhis balancing act in the spotlight. If Putin were to follow through on his numerous threats and use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the resulting international outcry could force India and China to reassess their approach to the war. How might the first use of a nuclear weapon in nearly eight decades tip the scales in Beijing and New Delhi?\n\nUSIPs Andrew Scobell, Alex Stephenson and Vikram Singh look at how China and India have navigated the wars geopolitical repercussions so far, how leaders in Beijing and New Delhi might respond to a Russian nuclear escalation in Ukraine and what effect it would have on their own nuclear doctrines.\n\nHow Russias Escalation in Ukraine Might Affect China\n\nScobell and Stephenson: While the West has expressed deep concern over Vladimir Putins recent statement that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Beijing has remained noticeably silent.\n\nUndoubtedly, the employment of a Russian tactical nuke would pose a dilemma for China. The international backlash alone could force Beijing to rethink its \"no limits\" partnership with Moscow. But a Russian strike would also go against Chinas decades-old nuclear policy.\n\nChinas No-First-Use Policy\n\nSince detonating its first nuclear device in 1964, China has pursued a no-first-use policy, as well as a strategy of deterrence through \"assured retaliation.\" Thus, for nearly six decades, Chinese leaders have viewed the role of nuclear weapons as limited to self-defense and as distinct from conventional operations and doctrine.\n\nThis position was reaffirmed last week by Li Song, the Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs, who said, \"China has solemnly committed to no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance.\"\n\nHowever, there have been recent signals that Beijing has elevated the role of nuclear weapons and integrated strategic deterrence in its overall military strategy.\n\nFor example, China has been growing its nuclear arsenal at an accelerated rate since at least 2021. And in his delivery of the work report at the recent 20th National Party Congress, Xi Jinping also proclaimed the need for China to build a strong \"strategic deterrence system.\" Instead of pointing to any legitimate change in its position on the use of nuclear weapons, however, these developments point more to Beijings changing perception of the international environment. Thus, if Russia employed a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukraine, Beijing would feel the need to publicly react, if only rhetorically.\n\nWhat a Nuclear Strike Would Mean for China-Russia Relations\n\nAlthough use of a nuclear weapon by Moscow would thrust Beijing into an extremely awkward situation, this would not necessarily prompt China to completely abandon its strategic partnership with Russia. While the China-Russia strategic partnership is certainly not without issues, it will probably continue as long as leaders in Beijing and Moscow both view the United States as their primary threat which is unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nSome have pointed to recent events such as Putins acknowledgement of Chinas \"questions and concerns\" about his war in Ukraine as evidence of cracks in the Sino-Russian relationship. But that is wishful thinking. In a recent meeting with Russian leaders, Chinas third-ranked leader, Li Zhanshu, expressed tacit support for the war in Ukraine, saying, \"We fully understand the necessity of all the measures taken by Russian aimed at protecting its key interests.\"\n\nIn all likelihood, Lis remarks accurately reflect Beijings position on the war. And just last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov where the two discussed \"the high level of mutual trust and firm mutual support between China and Russia,\" reaffirming Beijings commitment to the Sino-Russian relationship in the wake of Putins threats.\n\nThe recent work report at the National Party Congress also expressed a bleaker outlook on the international environment than its predecessors. The \"period of strategic opportunity,\" which has dominated party narratives in the last decade, is now fraught with \"risks\" and \"challenges,\" pointing to the threat posed by the United States.\n\nTo this end, Beijing is likely to tolerate further escalation in Ukraine short of a nuclear strike. Moreover, one cannot rule out the possibility that China will maintain its alignment with Russia even if the latter employed a tactical nuclear weapon. Beijings response may depend on the specific circumstances and Moscows justification for its use.\n\nBeijings Reaction to International Backlash\n\nXi Jinping has warned that China must \"be prepared to deal with worse-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters and even dangerous storms.\" If Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon, this would certainly constitute a dangerous storm, if not a worst-case scenario.\n\nChinese leaders would like to avoid that worst-case scenario if possible. In recent weeks, they have signaled their unease with Russias nuclear rhetoric and tried to dissuade Moscow from further threats albeit indirectly. A small step in the right direction came last week during a bilateral meeting between German Chancellor Olaf Schulz and Xi, where the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine and reaffirmed that the international community should \"oppose the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\" Another proactive move would be for a Chinese official to publicly reaffirm the recent joint statement by the five nuclear-weapon states on preventing nuclear war.\n\nChina wants to increase its \"international standing and influence\" and \"play a greater role in global governance\" according to its recent work report. If Moscow were to actually launch a nuclear strike, the subsequent international backlash would force Beijing to express some level of criticism or condemnation in order to project itself as a responsible great power with moral authority and conviction.\n\nSuch a scenario would undoubtedly serve as a major test for Sino-Russian relations, but it is by no means clear that China would completely rupture ties. Over the last decade, Beijing has increasingly used its influence in the United Nations and other multilateral organizations to deftly preempt, avoid or deflect international criticisms on a range of controversial issues from the mistreatment of Uyghurs and other Muslims in Chinas Xinjiang region to Russian atrocities against Ukraine.\n\nEven amid monumental international outrage, Beijing may feel confident enough in its ability to evade substantial blowback that it only offers a rhetorical response to a Russian nuclear strike. Chinese leaders have repeatedly tried to cast the United States and NATO as instigators in the Ukraine conflict to shift attention from Russia. Its possible the Sino-Russian relationship could weather the storm if Beijing were to spin the resulting outrage in a similar way and such a route would allow China to position itself as a mature and principled great power intent on seeking win-win solutions.\n\nHow Russias Nuclear Escalation Might Affect India\n\nSingh: In reacting to Russias invasion of Ukraine, New Delhi has remained neutral on key votes at the United Nations and called for peace without casting blame on Moscow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even publicly told Russian President Putin that \"todays era is not the era of war\" and encouraged him to bring the conflict to a close. But New Delhi has no intention of severing ties with Moscow, and Indian officials have been transparent about the constraints they operate under, particularly Indias dependence on military equipment of Russian origin.\n\nInstead, Indian officials have held to a middle line throughout the war sending humanitarian assistance to Ukraine while attempting to offset the economic impact of the war by purchasing Russian energy and fertilizer, among other actions.\n\nBut unlike China, which has doubled down on support of Moscow in the weeks after its National Party Congress, Indian leaders view the precedent-breaking assault on Ukraine as a threat to Indias own security. By invading Ukraine, Indias long-time partner has cast aside the core values that India relies on to protect itself from aggression by neighbors. The use of a nuclear weapon by Russia against Ukraine would bring about a crisis for Indian policymakers and make Indias current tightrope walk untenable.\n\nIndia first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974, calling it a \"peaceful nuclear explosion.\" Its nuclear doctrine has been to have a minimum credible deterrent and a no-first-use policy. For Indian military planners, nuclear weapons exist to deter combat, not as war-fighting tools. While some Indian leaders have floated the idea of adjusting the no-first-use policy to increase uncertainty and enhance deterrence, especially vis--vis Pakistan, no changes have been made to this doctrine.\n\nMoscow is Indias oldest and most reliable defense partner, notwithstanding Indias increased cooperation with the United States and its allies and partners over the past 20 years. But Moscow has deepened ties with China by announcing a \"no-limits\" partnership as Sino-India ties remain at their lowest point in over 40 years following clashes along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that claimed 20 Indian soldiers lives in 2020. Moscow has also increased outreach to Pakistan, which India views as its most consistent security threat.\n\nShould Moscow move forward with the first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II, it would challenge India in three primary ways:\n\n1. The collapse of global non-proliferation governance\n\nIn a normative sense, although it remains outside the U.N. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) framework, India abides by those long-held principles and wants them to survive. The 191-member NPT itself would be at risk if one of the five recognized nuclear-weapons states made unilateral and offensive use of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThis would force a deep reassessment of all Indian nuclear weapons strategy and doctrine. India would have to consider costly investments to upgrade and diversify its own nuclear weapons portfolio, which is smaller than that of either of its nuclear neighbors. With global non-proliferation governance shattered, India would likely seek to lead or actively participate in efforts to rebuild a global consensus against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n2. Understanding Chinas and Pakistans responses to nuclear use by Russia\n\nFrom a demonstration standpoint, India would worry over how China and Pakistan respond. Indian leaders believe their nuclear deterrence with China is stable, even in the aftermath of Chinese aggression and occupation of disputed territory along the Line of Actual Control.\n\nWhile Indian leaders assume Beijings focus will be on implications for Taiwan, they cannot ignore the fact that China claims the entire Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and Beijing may reassess how new uncertainty around nuclear use could serve to coerce or deter. Planners in New Delhi will need to understand how their Chinese counterparts change their thinking about the threat or use of nuclear strikes going forward.\n\nPakistan does not have a no-first-use doctrine. Indian planners already account for possible Pakistani use of a tactical nuclear device against forward-deployed Indian forces in the case of full-scale war. Indian leaders will expect Putins use of a nuclear weapon to increase the likelihood of Pakistani nuclear use. In particular, they will plan against and seek to deter Pakistan from using tactical nukes, possibly on Pakistans own territory, to strike or block advancing Indian forces.\n\nFollowing recent terrorist attacks traced back to Pakistan, India has engaged in counterattacks inside Pakistani territory. During the last crisis between the two South Asian countries, Pakistan retaliated inside Indian-controlled Kashmir and downed an Indian fighter jet. For Indian officials, understanding any changes in Pakistani thinking on nuclear use will be critical to future decisions about how to respond to an attack.\n\n3. The future of Indias relationships with Russia and the West\n\nFinally, and most importantly, Indias relationships with Russia and the West would never be the same after a Russian nuclear attack in Ukraine. The horror and outrage in the United States and Europe would likely lead to a \"with us or against us\" moment, with Russia ejected fully from the global banking system, including SWIFT, as well as secondary sanctions that are more severe than the toughest sanctions ever placed on Iran.\n\nIndia would be outraged by Russia violating the longstanding norm against nuclear use, but it would seek a way to preserve core aspects of its relationship with Moscow. For one thing, despite increasing domestic production of arms and diversifying sources to include the United States, Europe and Israel, New Delhi remains deeply dependent on Russian military equipment and would require years or even decades to transition away from them completely. And it would be difficult for Western nations to help India rapidly field everything from new tanks to missiles to submarines. For Indian leaders, navigating the sustainment of their Russian materiel while avoiding western sanctions may prove impossible. The United States, in particular, would probably sanction India like any other country should it continue to purchase Russian arms and spare parts in the aftermath of nuclear use.\n\nChina does not rely on Russia for most of its materiel and will likely seek to keep its partnership intact even if Xi criticizes the use of a nuclear weapon. In a worst-case scenario from the U.S. standpoint, China and Russia may partner in response to Western sanctions and invite India to join an alternative economic and political framework that manages transactions without the use of the U.S. dollar or global banking system. China, like India, has been reluctant to violate sanctions against Russia, but both countries have tested mechanisms for settling payments with Russia in local currency or through barter.\n\nOutside of Ukraine itself, India and other low-to-middle income countries are bearing the brunt of the cost of Russias aggression. Higher fuel, fertilizer and food costs are driving increases in poverty and hunger. Indian leaders believe they have a better chance of having a positive impact on ending this war by keeping their criticism of Putin mostly private. The specter of nuclear use and catastrophic impact it could have on Indias interests may lead them to push Russia to find a way out of its self-made quagmire.",

                "cc_text": "November 2022\n\nBy Kelsey Davenport\n\nIran announced steps to further expand its nuclear program as talks with the United States to restore the 2015 nuclear deal remain at an impasse that is likely to persist given the protests in Iran.\n\nIn an Oct. 10 report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran informed the agency of its plans to install an additional three cascades of IR-2 centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium. The report also confirmed that Iran had completed the installation of six cascades of IR-2 centrifuges and one cascade of IR-4 centrifuges since the last IAEA report was issued on Sept. 7. The IR-2 and IR-4 centrifuges enrich uranium more efficiently than Irans IR-1 model, which Tehran is limited to using to produce enriched uranium under the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), until 2026.\n\nOnce operational, these more advanced machines will further expand Irans uranium-enrichment capacity, which is already greater than at any point in the countrys history.\n\nIf negotiations resume, there is a risk that the United States will determine that Irans advancing nuclear program has undercut the nonproliferation benefits of the JCPOA. In such case, Washington may conclude that it is no longer worth the political price to lift sanctions as the deal requires and will abandon efforts to resurrect the accord.\n\nThe Biden administration is also taking action to increase pressure on Iran while negotiations remain stalled, including new sanctions targeting Irans petrochemical sector announced in October.\n\nAlthough Iran and the United States continue to express support for restoring the deal, domestic politics make this increasingly challenging.\n\nThe Raisi government is facing widespread protests in Iran after a young woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the hospital in September after being beaten by police for not adhering to the countrys strict dress code for women. Tehran has accused foreign powers of instigating the protests.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kananni said on Oct. 10 that the United States and Europe are linking the negotiations on the JCPOA to \"recent issues in Iran.\" Iran will not allow any country to meddle in its internal affairs, he said.\n\nIt is unclear what linkages Kananni was referencing, given that talks on the JCPOA remain stalled. U.S. officials have said Washington can support the protestors and a nuclear deal at the same time, but it would be politically more difficult for the Europeans and the United States to reach an agreement with Iran while the government in Tehran is violently suppressing the protests, particularly before the U.S. midterm elections on Nov. 8.\n\nIn an Oct. 14 speech, U.S. President Joe Biden said that the United States stands \"with the citizens, the brave women of Iranwho are demonstrating to secure their very basic, fundamental rights.\" Two days earlier, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the nuclear talks are \"not our focus right now\" and that the Biden administration is prioritizing \"shining a spotlight\" on the protestors. The administration also has lifted some sanctions, such as measures that restricted access to the internet and communications technologies, which officials say will support the protestors.\n\nEven after the elections, the U.S. political will may not exist to restore the nuclear agreement with Iran because of the protests. \"The Europeans had already lost their patience for dealing with Iran, and now weve lost our appetite\" even though a deal \"would still yield important nonproliferation benefits,\" an official from a European country that is a party to the deal said on Oct. 13.\n\nThe Biden administration is also under pressure not to reach an agreement with Iran at this time, given that a restored JCPOA would allow the Iranian government to access frozen assets and benefit from sanctions relief.\n\nIn addition to voicing support for the protestors, the EU and the United States imposed sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities involved in the crackdown. The EU also passed sanctions over Irans sale of drones to Russia. Russia has used these drones in its war against Ukraine, including attacks on civilians.\n\nFrench Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters in an Oct. 13 press briefing that the use of drones to bombard civilian targets \"likely constitute war crimes\" and violates UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Under that resolution, Iran is prohibited from exporting missile systems or unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, that are capable of delivering a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nThat threshold is defined as carrying a 500-kilogram payload a distance of more than 300 kilometers.\n\nIf JCPOA talks resume, a deal is far from certain. A major issue preventing agreement is Irans demands that the IAEA close its investigation into undeclared nuclear materials and activities from the pre-2003 period within a specific time frame and to refrain from further investigations.\n\nThe United States has made clear that it will not tie the IAEAs hands, but will support closing the investigation when the agency is satisfied that Iran has cooperated with its inquiries. (See ACT, October 2022.)\n\nMohammad Eslami, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, met IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Sept. 26 to resume talks over how to address the agencys investigation, which has remained stalled since May.\n\nTweets from Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian suggested that the two sides had agreed on a path forward for resolving the safeguards investigation, but the IAEA made no similar statement.\n\nGrossi confirmed that the meeting took place, but said only that there is a lot of work ahead to reach a conclusion.\n\nEven if the IAEA issue can be resolved, the United States is concerned that if talks resume, Iran may raise new demands or attempt to reopen closed issues, as it has in the past.\n\nRobert Malley, U.S. special envoy for Iran, told NPR on Oct. 7 that all other parties agreed to a deal to restore the JCPOA in March and then again in August.\n\nBut each time, he said, Iran countered with \"some new demands, most of the time either an unrealistic demand or one that was extraneous to the nuclear talks, something that had nothing to do with it.\"",

The Pentagon announced a new package of $400 million in security assistance on Friday. Credit... Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON The Defense Department is setting up a new command to oversee how the United States and its allies train and equip the Ukrainian military, the Pentagon announced on Friday along with a new package of $400 million in security assistance.\n\nThe Pentagons commitment to supplying Ukraine with weaponry and the new command are clear signals that the United States expects the threat from Russia to Ukraine and its neighbors to persist for many years, current and former senior U.S. officials said.\n\nThe command will \"ensure we are postured to continue supporting Ukraine over the long term,\" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters at a news briefing. \"We remain committed to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\"\n\nIn the military, a command is a focused organization dedicated to a particular geographical or strategic area. The new command, called the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, or SAG-U, will based in Germany and within the structure of the Pentagons European Command. With a staff of about 300 people, it will be focused on one mission: to help train and equip Ukraines military.\n\nThe new command will streamline a training and assistance system that was created on the fly after the Russian invasion in February. The Times reported in September that the new structure was in the works.\n\nThe revamped assistance program will be led by a high-ranking general who will replace Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, the head of the Armys 18th Airborne Corps, who has coordinated much of the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine from behind the scenes over the past several months.\n\nA leading candidate to take over the new position is Lt. Gen. Antonio A. Aguto, Jr., the head of the First U.S. Army headquarters, located at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, military officials said.\n\nThe additional $400 million in security assistance includes, for the first time, funding to refurbish 45 tanks from the Czech Republic, which will start arriving in Ukraine by the end of December, Ms. Singh said. The funding also will go to contracts for 1,100 Phoenix Ghost drones and an additional 40 riverine boats.\n\nThe latest announcement brings to $18.9 billion the amount in military assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The funds comprise a combination of immediate shipments from stockpiles as well as contracts for weapons to be delivered over the next three years.\n\nOver the past several months, General Donahue, who commanded the American evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021, has helped oversee training in Ukraine, talking to Ukrainian generals about their battlefield needs and drawing on his Special Operations background to advise his Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nGeneral Donahue and his staff have been deployed to Poland and Germany since the early days of the war. His staff recently returned to its main headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., where they were greeted this week by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. General Donahue will remain in Germany until his successor arrives, Pentagon officials said.\n\nThe new command, which will report to Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the top American officer in Europe, will carry out the decisions made by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 40 countries that the Defense Department created after the Russian invasion to address Ukraines needs and requests. Senior military officials from the member nations met in Brussels this week.\n\nThe changes, which aim to give a formal structure to what has been improvised since the wars onset, are roughly modeled on U.S. train-and-assist efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades.",

Russia \"puts technology at the service of terror,\" she said.\n\n\"Technology has in many ways brought us closer together through social media and messenger apps,\" Zelenska said Tuesday evening.\n\n\"But imagine, all of a sudden a social media account stops getting updated, the person running it no longer responds to messages.

He said it has allowed certain Russian actors to avoid facing sanctions.\n\n\"The Irish government has for years lobbied both Brussels and the White House so that certain Russian oligarchs might be exempted from both U.S. and EU sanctions,\" Cosgrave, who has long been critical of the Irish government, said onstage at Web Summit.\n\n\"My message is simple, how can Ireland help Ukraine stop bankrolling Russian oligarchs?\" he added.\n\nFor its part, Ireland says it is opposed to Russia's war against Ukraine and has joined its European Union alies in imposing strict sanctions on Moscow.\n\nRyan Browne",

This sustained targeting of energy infrastructure has not only immediate humanitarian impacts but may also have long-term consequences on civilian morale and resistance (1,4). If power outages persist, they could lead to a decline in support for the government and potentially foster a crisis akin to what has been seen in countries like Venezuela, marked by increased crime and investment risks (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The sustained attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have resulted in significant power outages, contributing to a decline in civilian morale as the country faces a potentially dark and cold winter. The destruction of over 30% of Ukraine's power stations since October 10 has caused widespread blackouts and increased the hardships for residents, with many experiencing daily power cuts lasting up to four hours (4,6). The situation is worsened by the fact that the power outages are often unscheduled, disrupting civilians' ability to plan and carry out everyday activities, as exemplified by the difficulties faced by citizens like the 70-year-old pensioner waiting for supplies and a hairdresser unable to work efficiently (8). \n\nIn the long term, the power outages could lead to a severe decline in resilience and determination among Ukrainians. With the Russian military's strategy to fracture the energy grid and subject millions to harsh winter conditions without power, water, or heat, the potential for a decrease in Ukrainian resistance is a serious concern (10). This strategy not only affects the immediate living conditions but could also have catastrophic implications for Ukraine's economy and political stability, as energy shortages could hamper both civilian life and the functioning of critical infrastructure. The international community, through the G7, has recognized the urgency of the situation and is coordinating efforts to provide equipment and assistance to maintain and fortify Ukraine's energy sector, recognizing the importance of sustained morale and resistance in the face of adversity (9,10)."

It also includes the creation of a RebuildUkraine Facility within the EU budget to provide grants and loans, emphasizing the G7's commitment to stand with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\" (3,7).\n\nThe effectiveness of the G7's coordination mechanism is seen in its comprehensive approach, which involves not only infrastructure repair but also defending it against ongoing attacks (1,2,7). The mechanism is a key reason for Ukraine's momentum in the war, as it has strengthened Ukraine's battlefield capabilities and weakened Russia's by impacting the Russian military's ability to wage war through unprecedented sanctions and export controls (1). Furthermore, the mechanism has been backed by substantial security support from a coalition of allies and partners, and it operates in conjunction with various efforts like the Energy Community Secretariat's active role in coordinating targeted donations and the EU's RePowerEU plan to ensure energy security (1,5,6). The G7's solidarity and coordinated assistance are vital as Ukraine faces winter challenges, with millions of consumers experiencing power outages and the urgent need to fix the country's damaged energy infrastructure (6,10)."

The state electricity operator announced blackouts in Kyiv and seven other regions following devastating strikes on the energy infrastructure (1). Despite having over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, the general gas supply crunch in Europe, exacerbated by Russian curtailments, means that Ukraine needs to conserve fuel to ensure sufficient volumes for next year, complicating the prospects for energy generation and heating (2). However, the Ukrainian authorities are exploring various measures to address the crisis, including conserving electricity, increasing thermal plant output, importing electricity, and accelerating repair works to restore power and water supply, even in regions like Kherson that have experienced damage from alleged attacks (2,4).",

As a result, emergency blackouts have been implemented in Kyiv and other regions, and the state electricity operator Ukrenergo has been forced to introduce power outages and restrictions to manage the balance of the power system amid ongoing attacks (1,7,9). The destruction of the energy infrastructure has left millions intermittently without electricity and water, exacerbating the hardships for civilians as winter approaches (7).\n\nDespite the substantial damage, Ukraine is exploring several options to manage and restore its power capabilities. These include conserving large amounts of electricity, utilizing thermal plants more intensively, importing electricity, and accelerating repair efforts (2). With over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, normally sufficient for winter needs, Ukraine must conserve fuel to maintain adequate supplies for the coming year, especially considering the general gas shortage in Europe (2). Repair and restoration work continues around the clock, indicating a concerted effort to mitigate the damages and restore the power grid as swiftly as possible (7). However, the restoration timeline remains uncertain, as exemplified by the situation in Kherson where it's unclear when electricity will be fully restored after the Russian forces destroyed all critical infrastructure before their withdrawal (8)."

                "summary": "Russia's reliance on Iran for drones due to its own military deficiencies has been a significant factor in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Iranian combat drones being used to target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure (1,2). The partnership between Russia and Iran has strengthened as a result of Western sanctions imposed on both countries, leading to Iran supplying military equipment, including the potential delivery of ballistic missiles, to support Russia's war efforts (3,5). This collaboration has not only facilitated Russia's systematic airstrike campaign on Ukraine's power infrastructure but also highlights Iran's disregard for reputational damage as it aids Russia's aggression in Europe (3,4). The impact of this alliance is evident in the increased risk of a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine, with millions potentially affected by the destruction of essential services (4).",
                "more_detailed": "The collaboration between Iran and Russia has significantly contributed to the latter's military operations in Ukraine, particularly through the supply of drones and military equipment. Iran's combat drones have become a crucial element in Russia's strategy, targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure and thus raising the specter of a humanitarian disaster. Iranian-made drones have been systematically used to attack energy infrastructure, a campaign that has been methodically planned to exploit Ukraine's vulnerabilities (1,4,6). Moreover, this partnership has extended to include the presence of Iranian military personnel in Crimea, aiding Russian forces directly (1). The relationship has flourished amid Russia's search for allies to circumvent Western sanctions, with Iran emerging as a key partner in this regard (5).\n\nThe impact of the Iran-Russia collaboration is multifaceted, influencing not only the conflict in Ukraine but also wider geopolitical dynamics. The use of Iranian drones and the potential introduction of Iranian ballistic missiles pose a new threat that could herald a new phase in the war, potentially altering the conflict's calculus (3,8). This partnership has also affected international diplomacy, with Ukraine calling for punitive measures against Iran for its support of Russia's aggression (6). Meanwhile, the sale of drones to Russia is seen as a violation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal by Western signatories, further complicating diplomatic relations (9). Additionally, Iran's growing role as a drone-exporting nation has implications beyond the immediate conflict, creating new tensions in various geopolitical axes, including a response from Israeli forces targeting Iranian drone capabilities in Syria (10)."

                "more_detailed": "The Ukrainian economy is under severe pressure due to the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in extensive damage to the country's energy infrastructure. The destruction of over 30% of Ukraine's power stations since October 10 has led to massive blackouts across the country, greatly impacting businesses and citizens alike (3). The national energy company Ukrenergo has implemented emergency power outages and restrictions to limit electricity use, further disrupting economic activities (4). As businesses like that of Pogulay face increased costs from using generators without the ability to raise prices due to the deteriorating economic situation, the World Bank predicts that Ukraine's economy may contract by 40% or more this year (2). The targeted attacks on energy infrastructure have compounded the challenges faced by Ukraine, with the capital city experiencing 1.5 times more households without power compared to recent days, leading to appeals for electricity conservation (10).\n\nIn light of these disruptions, Ukraine's recovery prospects post-conflict are contingent upon repairing the damaged energy sector. The success of these repair efforts hinge on extensive donations of equipment, with the Energy Community Secretariat and other international partners like the G7 mobilizing to provide the necessary assistance (1,6). The EU is also contributing by seeking to ensure energy security and diversify natural gas supplies while reducing demand for natural gas, in alignment with its RePowerEU plan (7). However, despite the support, the Ukrainian government has stressed that the country's recovery will not be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the conflict, adding a layer of complexity to the post-conflict economic landscape (8)."

                "cc_text": "Since the start of the war in Ukraine, relations between Russia and Iran have flourished. Having been hit by a new raft of tough Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow set about looking for alternative partners among other traditionally anti-Western countries including to bypass trade restrictions and Iran looks set to be one of the most promising. The aspect of their relationship that has attracted the most attention recently is Russias use of Iranian drones to terrorize Ukrainian cities. Both the Russian and Iranian governments have denied that the kamikaze drones the Russian army is using in Ukraine are Iranian, but all the evidence suggests that they are. Ukraines military intelligence services said at the end of October that Iran was also about to start supplying Russia with missiles. This is far from the extent of their joint projects, however. This year has seen a record number of meetings between senior Russian officials and their Iranian counterparts, including a visit to Tehran by Russian President Vladimir Putin. There was much discussion at these meetings of how to circumvent Western sanctions with Irans help. They were also aimed at showing Russian domestic audiences that Russia is not isolated on the international stage, despite Western efforts. The meetings did yield concrete agreements, too. Gazprom, for example, has promised to invest $40 billion in Irans oil and gas sector, while Iranian spare parts for both motor vehicles and airplanes, as well as vehicles themselves, will be exported to Russia. There has also been a surge in the number of flights between the two countries, while their trade turnover, which stood at $4 billion in 2021, could reach $6 billion \"in the near future,\" according to Tehran. This is not to say, however, that Iran will be able to compensate the Russian economy for the losses incurred as a result of Western sanctions. Even if those forecasts for the growth in trade turnover are accurate, that is still less than 1% of Russias total foreign trade. There is a huge gap between Iran and countries like Turkey, whose trade with Russia is worth about $30 billion a year.\n\nEven the new agreements have raised more doubts than optimism. Irans civil aviation industry has been in crisis for many years (also due to Western sanctions), and certainly will not be salvaged by the sale of individual parts to Russia. The Iranian automobile industry has also seen better days. This year, the government decided to stop manufacturing a range of models due to their excessive fuel consumption, poor safety and ecological standards, and high cost compared with similar models made elsewhere. It will make up for the deficit by importing foreign cars. There are areas in which Iran could fill a niche on the Russian market, such as pharmaceuticals, construction materials, and cosmetics. But the potential for development is hardly unlimited. Implementing large-scale Russian state projects in Iran and making them cost-effective wont be plain sailing either. Tehran has a deficit of hard currency and has been battling a budget deficit for years. This has created problems for Moscow in the past: Iran has still not paid off its debts to Russia for building the Bushehr nuclear plant. As of 2021, it still owed over $500 million. The new initiatives, such as the construction of the Sirik power plant and the electrification of Irans railways, are due to be financed with the help of a Russian loan for $5 billion. If Moscows mission is to increase its political influence in Iran using these projects, then its approach can perhaps be justified. But it certainly wont help to save the Russian economy at a time of sanctions. Any project may be further complicated by the various and growing waves of protests Iran has been seeing for the last 18 months. The outbursts of unrest are becoming increasingly massive, protracted, and uncompromising in their criticism of the countrys political regime. The authorities harsh responseclosing down public places and limiting internet accessis only making matters worse. If the government loses control of the situation in the country overall, or even in individual regions, Iran could be plunged into a severe, Venezuela-style crisis, leading to increased crime, taxation problems, and difficulties maintaining critical infrastructure. This level of instability is creating serious investment risks and getting in the way of implementing any agreements.\n\nnews Putin in Iran for Syria Summit Overshadowed By Ukraine War Read more",

But Irans foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with \"a limited number\" of drones before Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nHossein Amirabdollahian, however, claimed that Tehran did not know if its drones were used against Ukrainian targets and stated Irans commitment to stopping the conflict.\n\nLater on Saturday, Ukraine warned Iran that \"the consequences of complicity\" with Moscow would be \"greater than the benefit\".\n\n\"Tehran should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine will be much greater than the benefit of Russias support,\" foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook.\n\nAl Jazeeras Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said the Western signatories of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal claim the sale of drones by Iran to Russia is a violation of the agreement, which the United States withdrew from in 2018.\n\n\"Under the agreement, the Iranian government is not allowed to sell or import any advanced military equipment or technology,\" she said.\n\nJabbari also said the ban in question, which was enforced in 2007, expired in October 2020.\n\n\"The Iranian officials say the excuses put forth by Western powers are ludicrous,\" said Jabbari.\n\nRussian attacks continue\n\nRussian shelling of Ukrainian regions went on into the early hours of Saturday.\n\nAbout 40 shells were fired overnight at the city of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznichenko said on Telegram. Russian forces targeted the city and the areas around it with heavy artillery. Two fires broke out, and more than a dozen residential and utility buildings, as well as a gas pipeline, were damaged, the official said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian forces shot down a drone and another projectile, according to Reznichenko.\n\nIn the southern Mykolaiv region, the overnight shelling of rural areas damaged several houses, but did not cause any casualties, Mykolaiv Governor Vitali Kim said on Telegram.\n\nRussian forces also fired missiles at the southeastern Zaporizhia region, which has been illegally annexed by Moscow and large parts of which remain occupied. According to regional Governor Oleksandr Starukh, the attack took place shortly after midnight, damaging the buildings of three businesses and a number of cars.\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, also annexed and partially occupied by Russia, eight cities and villages have been shelled, including Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Porkovsk.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in Donetsk reported an attempt on the life of a Moscow-appointed judge of the regions Supreme Court. Alexander Nikulin, who was on a judicial panel that in June sentenced to death two Britons and a Moroccan fighting on the Ukrainian side, has been hospitalised with gunshot wounds and is in grave condition, Kremlin-backed officials said.\n\nAccording to Ukraines presidential office, at least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded over the past 24 hours by Russian shelling of nine Ukrainian regions, where drones, missiles and heavy artillery were used.\n\nIn the Russian-occupied Kherson region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive is under way, the Russian military continues to abduct local residents, the presidential office said, with the most recent cases taking place over the past 24 hours.",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), alongside the U.S. Department of State, sanctioned a transnational network procuring technology that supports the Russian military-industrial complex. OFAC also designated a global network of financial facilitators, enablers, and others associated with two key Kremlin-linked elites whose fortunes are intertwined with the West. In total, todays actions designated 14 individuals and 28 entities, and identified eight aircraft as blocked property.\n\n\"The United States will continue to expose and disrupt the Kremlins military supply chains and deny Russia the equipment and technology it needs to wage its illegal war against Ukraine,\" said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \"Todays actions demonstrate Treasurys steadfast commitment to targeting people around the world aiding Putins war effort and the crony elites who bankroll his regime. Together with our broad coalition of partners, we will continue to use our sanctions and export controls to weaken Russias military on the battlefield and cut into the revenue Putin is using to fund his brutal invasion.\"\n\nTARGETING RUSSIAN MILITARY PROCUREMENT NETWORK\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves, and Deputy Director of National Intelligence Morgan Muir met with top officials representing ministries of finance and other government agencies from 33 countries to discuss the effects of international sanctions and export controls on Russias military-industrial complex and critical defense supply chains. The Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, and State released an alert that same day detailing the impact of international sanctions and export controls. Read the joint alert here.\n\nThe joint alert highlights that Russias defense industry is reliant on imported microelectronics. Today, in coordination with the U.S. Department of States designation pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 of AO PKK Milandr (Milandr), a Russian microelectronics company that has been described as part of the Russian military research and development structure defense technology firm, OFAC took action to disrupt Milandrs illicit global microelectronics procurement network.\n\nConsistent with international commitments to sever Russias access to key components for its military-industrial complex, the United States will continue to target Russias efforts to resupply its weapons and sustain its war of aggression against Ukraine, including any foreign persons who assist Russia in those efforts.\n\nThe Armenia-based affiliate of Milandr, Milur Electronics LLC (Milur Electronics), was initiated for the purpose of placing orders from foreign factories, producing integrated microchips, and conducting overseas sales. Milur Electronics has been used as a Milandr front company as a means to conduct Milandrs business with foreign partners. In fact, Milandr employees have sought to access Milur Electronics network themselves to conduct business. Milur Electronics was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Milandr.\n\nMilur SA is the Switzerland-based primary shareholder of Milur Electronics and has been utilized by employees and business associates of Milandr to coordinate financial transfers to Milur Electronics. Two Milur SA officials designated today were involved in the scheme to establish Milur Electronics, Swiss national Jacques Pasche (Pasche) and Estonian and Swiss national Holger Leng (Leng). Treasury additionally designated the General Director of both Milandr itself and Milur Electronics, Russian national Mikhail Ilyich Pavlyuk (Pavlyuk). Pavlyuk, working with Milur SA, initiated the registration process in Armenia for Milur Electronics. Furthermore, Pavlyuk has worked to transfer funds from Milur SA to Milur Electronics, as part of which he siphoned a substantial amount into his personal bank account.\n\nMilur SA was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Milur Electronics. Pasche and Leng were designated pursuant to E.O.14024 for being leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of Milur SA. Pavlyuk was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Milur Electronics.\n\nFinally, OFAC designated Sharp Edge Engineering Inc. (Sharp Edge), a Taiwan-based front company used to purchase microelectronic components from Asian companies. Milandr employees have utilized a Sharp Edge account to procure equipment. Sharp Edge was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Milandr.\n\nSULEIMAN KERIMOVS NETWORK\n\nOn September 30, 2022, OFAC designated Suleiman Abusaidovich Kerimov (Kerimov) pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR). OFAC had previously designated Kerimov on April 6, 2018 pursuant to E.O. 13661 for being an official of the GoR. Kerimov has also been sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nIn June 2022, OFAC issued a Notification of Blocked Property to Heritage Trust, a Delaware-based entity in which Kerimov has a property interest. As of June 30, 2022, Heritage Trust held assets valued at over $1 billion. OFACs extensive enforcement investigation revealed that Kerimov used a network of relatives, advisers, and opaque legal entities to invest in the United States and utilized a complex series of legal structures and front persons to obscure his interest in Heritage Trust. In May 2022, Fijian law enforcement executed a seizure warrant freezing the Motor Yacht Amadea, a 348-foot luxury vessel owned by Kerimov.\n\nTodays action targets a broad network of Kerimovs family members, associates, and facilitators. These designations should serve as another warning that those who support sanctioned Russian persons risk being sanctioned themselves.\n\nKERIMOVS FAMILY\n\nToday OFAC designated Kerimovs immediate family, including his wife Firuza Nazimovna Kerimova (Firuza), daughters Gulnara Suleymanovna Kerimova (Gulnara) and Amina Suleymanovna Kerimova (Amina), and son Said Suleymanovich Kerimov (Said) pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being a spouse or adult child of Kerimov. Said has also been sanctioned by the EU, Switzerland, and the UK.\n\nOFAC also designated four France-based real estate companies belonging to Gulnara: Service Immobiliere Antibes SAS, Service Immobiliere et Gestion SAS, VH Antibes SAS, and Villa Lexa Estates SAS. All four companies were designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gulnara.\n\nRelatedly, OFAC designated Swiss national Laurin Katz (Katz), who serves as president of all four of Gulnaras France-based companies. Katz was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gulnara.\n\nAdditionally, Alstone Investment AG (Alstone), a Switzerland-based firm formerly known as Swiru Holding AG, was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Katz.\n\nBeyond Kerimovs immediate family, OFAC also designated Kerimovs nephew Nariman Gadzhievich Gadzhiev (Gadzhiev), a Russian national residing in Switzerland. Gadzhiev is a primary financial facilitator for Kerimov. Gadzhiev was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Kerimov.\n\nOFAC also designated United Arab Emirates-based holding company Constellation Advisors Ltd for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Gadzhiev.\n\nALEXANDER-WALTER STUDHALTER NETWORK\n\nSwiss national Alexander-Walter Studhalter (Studhalter) has been a key player in Kerimovs financial network, including managing Kerimovs companies. Studhalter has also allegedly laundered significant amounts of money on Kerimovs behalf. Studhalter was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the management consulting sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nOFAC also designated eight entities across six countries associated with Studhalter. These include:\n\nMG International AG (MG International), a Studhalter-owned, Switzerland- and Russia-based management consultancy firm of which Kerimov used to be a shareholder and where Gulnara was previously employed;\n\n(MG International), a Studhalter-owned, Switzerland- and Russia-based management consultancy firm of which Kerimov used to be a shareholder and where Gulnara was previously employed; Studhalter International Group AG (Studhalter Group), a Switzerland-based financial company;\n\n(Studhalter Group), a Switzerland-based financial company; Swiss International Advisory Group AG (SwissIAG), a Switzerland-based accounting and tax consultancy firm;\n\n(SwissIAG), a Switzerland-based accounting and tax consultancy firm; Papa Oscar Ventures GmbH (Papa Oscar Germany), a Germany-based holding company;\n\n(Papa Oscar Germany), a Germany-based holding company; Eurimo Holding SA (Eurimo), a Luxembourg-based holding company;\n\n(Eurimo), a Luxembourg-based holding company; Papa Oscar Ventures SE SL (Papa Oscar Spain), a Spain-based holding company;\n\n(Papa Oscar Spain), a Spain-based holding company; Swiss International Real Estate Portfolio AG (SwiREP), a Switzerland-based real estate firm; and\n\n(SwiREP), a Switzerland-based real estate firm; and SCI AAA Properties (SCI), a France-based real estate firm.\n\nMG International was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the management consulting sector of the Russian Federation economy. Studhalter Group, SwissIAG, Papa Oscar Germany, Eurimo, Papa Oscar Spain, SwiREP, and SCI were all designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Studhalter.\n\nStudhalters sons, Jeremy Eric Camille Studhalter and Hugo Ange Christophe Studhalter were both designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been leaders, officials, senior executive officers, or members of the board of directors of SwissIAG, an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.\n\nMURAT ALIEV NETWORK\n\nAdditionally, OFAC designated Russian businessman and investor Murat Magomedovich Aliev (Aliev), a former executive at a Kerimov investment firm, who has links to Studhalter.\n\nFor example, Alievs Moscow-based investment firm Limited Liability Company Bonum Capital (LLC Bonum Capital) is located in the same Moscow building as MG Internationals Russian branch. Swiss national Inga Rettich (Rettich) is another link between Studhalter and Aliev. Rettich, who manages the family office at SwissIAG, is also a director at Bonum Capital Cyprus Ltd (Bonum Cyprus), an Aliev-owned Cyprus-based holding company.\n\nAliev was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy. LLC Bonum Capital was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy and for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Aliev. Bonum Cyprus was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Aliev. Rettich was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of Bonum Cyprus, an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.\n\nOFAC also designated the following five companies associated with Aliev:\n\nBonum Capital Investors Corp (Bonum BVI), a British Virgin Islands-based holding company;\n\n(Bonum BVI), a British Virgin Islands-based holding company; Limited Liability Company Bonum Management (Bonum Management) and Limited Liability Company Bonum Investments (Bonum Investments), Russia-based financial services companies;\n\n(Bonum Management) and Limited Liability Company Bonum Investments (Bonum Investments), Russia-based financial services companies; Limited Liability Company RB-Esteit (RB-Esteit), a Russia-based real estate firm; and\n\n(RB-Esteit), a Russia-based real estate firm; and Limited Liability Company Aviakompaniya Dalnevostochnaya KSM (KSM), a Russia-based air freight company.\n\nBonum BVI, Bonum Investments, and KSM were all designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Aliev. Bonum Management was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Bonum Cyprus. RB-Esteit was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Bonum Investments.\n\nKERIMOV-LINKED LUXURY AVIATION COMPANY\n\nMalta- and Russia-based aircraft management company Emperor Aviation Ltd (Emperor Aviation) has coordinated luxury travel for Kerimovs immediate family, including Gulnara, even after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\n\nEmperor Aviation was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the aerospace sector of the Russian Federation economy and for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Gulnara.\n\nOFAC identified eight aircraft as blocked property in which Emperor Aviation, the operator of the luxury planes, has an interest:\n\n9H-AMN, a Bombardier BD-700-1A11 (Manufacturers Serial Number (MSN) 9324)\n\na Bombardier BD-700-1A11 (Manufacturers Serial Number (MSN) 9324) 9H-ARK , a Bombardier BD-700-1A10 (MSN 60011)\n\n, a Bombardier BD-700-1A10 (MSN 60011) 9H-EAA, a Cessna Citation XLS+ (MSN 6170)\n\na Cessna Citation XLS+ (MSN 6170) 9H-MAO , a Bombardier BD-700-1A10 (MSN 9223)\n\n, a Bombardier BD-700-1A10 (MSN 9223) 9H-OKO, a Gulfstream G650 (MSN 6356)\n\na Gulfstream G650 (MSN 6356) 9H-SIS , a Bombardier Challenger (MSN 6050)\n\n, a Bombardier Challenger (MSN 6050) 9H-SSK, a Gulfstream G650 (MSN 6195)\n\na Gulfstream G650 (MSN 6195) 9H-TIO, a Bombardier BD-700-1A10 (MSN 9813)\n\nConcurrent with the designation of Emperor Aviation, OFAC issued General License (GL) 40C.\n\nGL 40C authorizes certain transactions involving blocked entities, including Emperor Aviation, that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the provision, exportation, or reexportation of goods, technology, or services to ensure the safety of civil aviation, provided that the aircraft is registered solely outside of the Russian Federation and the goods, technology, or services provided, exported, or reexported are for civilian aviation purposes.\n\nANDREY GRIGORYEVICH GURYEVS SWISS HOLDING COMPANIES\n\nOn August 2, 2022, OFAC designated Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev (A.G.

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFACs ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFACs Frequently Asked Question 897.

                "cc_text": "Image In Bakhmut on Saturday. The city, in Ukraines eastern Donetsk region, has endured months of relentless shelling. Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times\n\nFighting raged around the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut, Russian and Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow sought to capture an eastern city for the first time in months amid a string of recent setbacks on the battlefield.\n\nA correspondent for Russias state-run RIA Novosti news agency said that troops with the Wagner Group, a private military force with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin, had seized the village of Ivangrad, which is close to a road on Bakhmuts southern approach, and were fighting fierce battles in another suburb.\n\nA spokesman for Ukraines forces in the east, Serhii Cherevaty, said that Bakhmut was \"one of the hottest spots\" in the region, and the place where \"the enemy is the most aggressive, with the concentration of its maximum forces.\" He told a Ukrainian television channel that 30,000 Russian personnel were deployed to the assault.\n\nEven as Russian forces appeared to be attacking Bakhmut from several directions, it was not immediately clear what they would gain by capturing a city that months of relentless bombardment have reduced nearly to rubble. Independent military analysts have said that the campaign for Bakhmut, an industrial center that was home to 70,000 people before the war, serves little strategic purpose for Moscow because Ukrainian advances to the north have severed the city from important rail links.\n\nThere was no independent confirmation of the battlefield developments, but comments by Ukrainian officials indicated an intensifying Russian push on the city, and a growing toll for the civilians who remain there.\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, the Ukrainian military administrator for the Donetsk region, which includes Bakhmut, said that Russian forces had killed three civilians in the region on Friday, including two in Bakhmut. The deputy mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksandr Marchenko, told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that Russias troops were \"trying to storm the city from several directions.\"\n\nMost residents have fled Bakhmut, and New York Times journalists who visited the city in recent days observed small groups of Ukrainian soldiers gathering in abandoned buildings and firing mortars from the street.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces have held out, Bakhmut has become a symbol of Russias failure to achieve Mr. Putins objective of controlling the entire eastern Donbas area, an industrial territory where Moscow-backed separatists established breakaway republics in 2014. In April, Mr. Putin made capture of the Donbas a military priority and, last month, Russia illegally annexed the areas two regions, Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nBut Moscow has made little progress since July, when it captured the last cities in Luhansk. Ukrainian forces sweeping down from the reclaimed Kharkiv region in the northeast have gained ground in the Donbas while, hundreds of miles to the south, Russian troops are under pressure to hold on to Kherson, one of the first regions they captured after invading Ukraine in February.\n\nMichael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for a New American Security, said on the War on the Rocks podcast last week that Russian forces had been \"trying to grind their way in Bakhmut for months now,\" and added, \"They havent taken very much territory at all.\"\n\nMr. Kofman said that the city was an important prize for the Wagner Groups leader, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and close associate of Mr. Putin, and that his stature would rise within the Kremlin if his campaign were to succeed. But his forces have suffered significant losses in Bakhmut in recent days, according to Mr. Kofman, who described the push there as a \"pointless offensive\" for Russia.\n\nSeveral military analysts say that Ukraines successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv in September deprived Bakhmut of its strategic significance, since Moscow has lost control of the railway hubs in the cities of Izium and Lyman, meaning it cannot use Bakhmut as a launchpad for attacks on other cities in Donetsk.",

Blinken At a Press Availability\n\nNovember 4, 2022\n\nMuseum of Art and Culture\n\nMnster, Germany\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good evening, everyone. We just concluded two very productive days of meetings here in Mnster, and I first want to thank very much our German hosts for their incredibly warm hospitality, and also recognize Germany and especially my friend and counterpart, Foreign Minister Baerbock, for her leadership over what has been a very challenging but also very consequential year.\n\nWhen the G7 foreign ministers met almost a year ago in Liverpool, we sent a clear message that if President Putin invaded Ukraine, we would together impose, and I quote, \"massive consequences and severe costs.\" President Putin bet that we wouldnt back up our words with actions. We proved him wrong.\n\nSince February, our nations have led a coalition of dozens of allies and partners in providing substantial security support for Ukraines brave defenders as they fight for their territory, for their democracy, and for their people. Weve imposed unprecedented sanctions and export controls that have directly impacted the Russian militarys ability to wage war. These efforts, coordinated in large part through the G7, have strengthened Ukraines battlefield capabilities and weakened Russias. Theyre also a key reason that Ukraine has momentum in this war.\n\nWere also working together to impose sanctions on those supporting President Putins war. That includes Iran, whose combat drones are killing Ukrainian civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure, and whose personnel in Crimea are assisting Russia in carrying out these brutal attacks.\n\nThe G7 is also providing economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine as President Putin tries to make up for Russias defeats on the battlefield by targeting civilian infrastructure that provides Ukrainian men, women, children, and elderly people with heat, water, and electricity. Russia has destroyed some 40 percent of Ukraines energy infrastructure, including thermal energy plants that provide many Ukrainian homes, schools, hospitals with heat in the wintertime, when temperatures can drop to 20 degrees below Celsius. President Putin seems to have decided that if he cant seize Ukraine by force, he will try to freeze it into submission. This is just the latest crime that President Putin is committing against the people of Ukraine. It was not enough to fill mass graves in Bucha and Irpin. It was not enough to cut off food, water, and medicine to the residents of Mariupol. It was not enough to violently uproot tens of thousands of Ukrainians from their homes and deport them to Russia through so-called filtration operations. On top of all of this, President Putin is also fearmongering about nuclear weapons.\n\nAs the G7 has done at every step, were addressing Russias latest escalations together and standing firm with Ukraine. On infrastructure, the G7 agreed to create a new coordination group to help repair, restore, and defend Ukraines energy grid the very grid that President Putin is brutalizing. And were focusing more of our security support on helping Ukraine protect against these attacks, strengthening air defenses, and ramping up defense production.\n\nWhen President Putin claimed that Ukraine was making a so-called dirty bomb at three sites, Ukraine asked the IAEA to investigate. Yesterday, its experts debunked Putins false claim. Together with the G7, countries around the world are making clear to President Putin that any use of a nuclear weapon would be catastrophic for him and for Russia.\n\nAll our countries are making sacrifices to sustain this critical support, and were supporting each other in doing that. On energy, for example, the United States has exported 53 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas to Europe. Thats nearly two and a half times what we exported in 2021 and will provide our friends with a vital reserve as they head into the winter. Over the last year, the G7 has also come together to meet other global challenges that none of our nations can address alone. We discussed several of these here in Munster, including the unprecedented global food crisis driven by climate change, by COVID, and conflict, including Russias war in Ukraine. In June, President Biden and other G7 leaders announced that our countries would invest $4.5 billion in strengthening food security with more than half of that coming from the United States, and we pledged billions more since that time.\n\nWere grateful for the efforts of the United Nations and Turkey to bring Russia back into the Black Sea Grain Initiative. In just over three months, that initiative has allowed over 10 million tons of grain to leave Ukraines ports, helping drive down prices everywhere. Two thirds of the wheat shipped, the primary food for the worlds poor, has gone to developing countries. But the truth is we shouldnt have to negotiate constantly with President Putin to allow food to get out to the world. Thats why the international community is sending a clear message to Moscow that it should stop using hunger as a bargaining chip, and extend the grain deal long before it expires later this month.\n\nWe also discussed relations with China. The G7 stands together in defense of the rulesbased international order so that all nations can choose their path free from intimidation, coercion, or unfair trade practices. We reaffirmed our abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our strong opposition to any unilateral changes to the status quo. We all recognize the need to cooperate with China on global challenges, like the climate crisis, which we cannot address without the worlds largest emitter being apart of it, and global health security. But in our discussions here, we were also clear-eyed about the need to align our approach to the PRC in the face of growing coercion and push back together against Beijings market distorting policies and practices, which hurt workers and industries in all of our countries.\n\nIran was also on our agenda. Were inspired by the courageous young women who continue to protest across the country, almost 50 days since the killing of Mahsa Amini, despite the regimes vicious crackdown. The next generations of Iranians are demonstrating that their desire to be free, to have opportunity, will not be extinguished even by the fiercest repression. Were working together to sanction those involved in the crackdown. Were also working with civil society and tech companies to provide digital services, so the Iranian people can communicate with one another and shine a spotlight on the regimes repression, even as it tries repeatedly to shut down the internet.\n\nWe also discussed the crisis in Haiti, where gangs month-long blockade of ports is exacerbating a growing cholera outbreak, food and fuel shortages, and rampant violence. Were working together to hold these criminals and their patrons accountable through sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council, as well as new sanctions adopted by the United States and Canada that we announced today on two Haitian nationals, Joseph Lambert and Youri Latortue. Were grateful for Canadas leadership and focusing the international community on helping the Haitian people find a way forward, and we will continue to support these efforts. That includes building on our joint work to strengthen the Haitian National Police, who I understand have succeeded in retaking the Varreux terminal and port, which is vital for restoring the flow of food and fuel.\n\nIn our discussions on the DPRK, the G7 partners strongly condemned the latest escalatory launch of ballistic missiles and the destabilizing effects theyre having in the region.\n\nIn addition to focusing on the immediate challenges today, the G7 continues to look over the horizon to how we can build the capacity to anticipate and prevent other crises going forward. African countries are vital partners in building this capacity, from boosting the global supply of renewable energy, to strengthening global health and food security; and our deepening cooperation was a central focus of the G7s meeting today with leaders from the African Union, Kenya, and Ghana.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities signed earlier this week between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front shows what we can achieve when we support Africanled solutions. We applaud the African Union, the governments of Kenya and South Africa for driving this process. And we appreciated the opportunity for the United States to offer support. The United States commends Prime Minister Abiy and the TPLF leadership for reaching this agreement, and we look forward to its swift implementation, particularly the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians. The situation is fragile; there will be challenges ahead. But the United States is committed to working with our partners towards a durable peace a message that I underscored in my conversations over the last 48 hours with Prime Minister Abiy from Ethiopia, with Kenyan President Ruto, and South Africas Foreign Minister Pandor.\n\nThe work the G7 has done here will lay the foundation for the issues that President Biden and his fellow leaders will discuss at the G20 Summit in Bali, in just over a weeks time. And all are issues that Japan will carry forward when it takes over the G7 presidency in January.\n\nAs we saw here in Munster, when it comes to addressing the fundamental challenges of our time, the worlds leading democracies are aligned, were united; we are working together as never before. And when people around the world take a step back to ask in this challenging time which countries are helping solve their problems, rather than creating them, I think theyll find a clear answer. Thats what we demonstrated here. Thats what well continue to deliver on as we go forward and go forward together. Thank you.\n\nMR PATEL: Well take some questions. The first question goes to Humeyra Pamuk from Reuters.\n\nQUESTION: Hello, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for doing this. I have a multi-part question, one of your favorites, so please bear with me.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Okay, let me take my pen out. (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: While G7 countries were holding talks here today, the host countrys leader, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, was visiting Beijing and met with President Xi, whose countries not so long ago declared a \"no limits partnership\" with Russia. The United States is trying to project transatlantic unity in the face of Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dont you think this trip damages that effort? Can you say the United States is fully supportive of this trip? And when you look at their common statement opposing the use of nuclear weapons, do you see that do you take that as a sign that Beijing might start increasing pressure on Russia?\n\nAnd on what you just said about the G7 agreeing on a communique, the communique language on China is much weaker. Can you explain why the discrepancy?\n\nAnd very quickly on Ukraine, G7 agreed to establish a coordination mechanism. Can you talk a little bit about that? What does that entail and when will it be set up? Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Humeyra, thanks very much. A few things.\n\nFirst, what Ive seen over the last two years is growing convergence between the United States and Europe when it comes to our approach to China, and thats been manifested in a whole variety of ways; to cite just one example, work were doing together with the European Union in the Trade and Technology Council as well as the work that were doing together here in the G7 with European countries as well as with partners from Canada and Japan.\n\nWeve engaged on shared concerns about some of the things that China does, including its coercive economic practices that are affecting all of our countries, threatening behavior toward Taiwan which risks challenging the peace and stability that countries rely on when it comes to the Taiwan Straits, the human rights record; and of course the risk of deepening or creating new economic dependencies in critical areas. On all of these issues, the United States and Europe are largely aligned, and as I said, weve seen a growing convergence.\n\nChancellor Scholz laid out in very clear terms his objectives for his visit to Beijing in an op-ed that was published this week. And we strongly agree with what he shared in that op-ed. That includes, by the way, encouraging President Xi to press President Putin on never using a nuclear weapon of any kind. And so, I think again, from everything that Ive seen, including the conversations here in Germany with our German partners as well as with all of our G7 partners, the convergence of the alignment on China is increasingly strong and increasingly clear.\n\nWhen it comes to the coordination mechanism, what we agreed yesterday with the G7 was that given the very deliberate attempt by Russia, by President Putin, to destroy as much of Ukraines critical infrastructure as possible particularly the energy grid and everything necessary to heat peoples homes, to make sure that hospitals can function, the schools can be heated and have electricity, we determined that together there is much we can do to help Ukrainians as necessary repair whats been destroyed, replace whats been destroyed, make more resilient the entire infrastructure. And so, were doing it in a coordinated way because we all have resources to bring to bear to addressing that problem. And weve established, as I said, an actual mechanism through the G7 to make sure that we all understand exactly what the needs are and that we come forward with what we can bring to the table. Its a little bit like the Ramstein process for helping Ukraine with its defense needs. Were doing the same thing, in effect, on energy.\n\nMR PATEL: Next lets go to Claudia Kramer-Santel.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, after declaring the Zeitenwende, Chancellor Scholz was criticized a lot because of not being doing enough for military aid for Ukraine and stuff. Do you think this has changed and developed, and how do you see the role of Germany in this process and your cooperation with Annalena Baerbock?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first when it comes to cooperation and coordination with the foreign minister, it could not be stronger. And she has been a strong, principled, as well as pragmatic leader when it comes to dealing with Russias aggression against Ukraine and for that matter on every other issue that were working on together. And we saw that again, today, over the last two days with her leadership of the G7.\n\nMore broadly, I have to tell you I can only applaud what Germany has done in defense of Ukraine these past almost nine months. Germany has been one of Ukraines largest donors, including lethal security assistance. Its played a hugely important humanitarian role, hosting more than a million Ukrainian refugees. Its also played a vital role over the course of the entire G7 presidency by making sure helping to make sure that all of us stay together in defense of Ukraine, in exerting pressure on Russia to end its aggression; as well as those of us who are NATO members doing whats necessary to strengthen our defensive Alliance in case Russias threat extends to NATO. And, of course, Germany has led on crafting the major EU sanctions package or packages, I should say that have been deployed, again, to put pressure on Russia to end its aggression.\n\nWe agreed together over the last couple of days that theres more that we can and must and will do. But throughout this process, Germany has been the strongest of partners and a real leader.\n\nMR PATEL: Well next go to John Hudson with The Washington Post.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks very much. Hi, Mr. Secretary. With regards to the G7s plans to set a price cap on Russian oil, the Kremlin has already said that they will withhold any oil sales to countries that implement a price cap. Can you assure U.S. and global consumers that the plan wont backfire and increase gasoline prices?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So, the purpose of the price cap is twofold. Its to ensure that energy continues to come onto the market to meet demand thats been our approach all along; and second, to put some limits on President Putins ability to line his pockets with the proceeds of sales of energy to fuel and fund the war against Ukraine. And I believe that that mechanism will help us do just that.\n\nRussia needs to sell energy for in order just to keep its keep the country going, keep the economy going. And yes, it wants to sell energy in order to fund the war against Ukraine. But at least putting a ceiling on that makes the downsides of Russia continuing to sell energy less while making sure that energy continues to remain on the market. Russia will make whatever decisions it makes, but I think it will have an interest in continuing to sell energy. And again, this is a good mechanism for both ensuring that energy remains on the market, but the gains that Russia gets from it have a ceiling on them.\n\nMR PATEL: Well\n\nQUESTION: Will the cap create price swings?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, we will see how this plays out. But what Im hearing from countries around the world, including beyond Europe, is an expectation that this will be a mechanism, again, that helps ensure that energy continues to get to market while limiting the benefits that Russia accrues from that.\n\nMR PATEL: Final question will go to Marcus Pindur.\n\nQUESTION: Hello, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for taking our questions. My name is Marcus Pindur from a large German public radio broadcaster, Deutschlandfunk. There seems to be a lot of agreement on energy and infrastructure help for Ukraine. That show of unity is certainly commendable, but there is an elephant in the room, and that is the military situation on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nGermany has a large number hundreds of armored personnel carriers and main battle tanks, and but the chancellor refuses to provide them to Ukraine, with changing reasons. One of those reasons is that Germany is not providing Western-built tanks, because the U.S. does not provide Western-built tanks. I would like you to comment on that. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much. From even before the Russian aggression started as we saw it, a rising storm, a possibility that Russia was going to do what we feared it would do, we have tried to make sure that Ukrainians had in their hands the tools the weapons necessary to defend themselves. And so well before the actual aggression, the United States did a number of what we call drawdowns from our own military equipment to get them to Ukraine, starting in September a year ago, then again at Christmastime before the end of before the end of last year. And it was that very equipment, including things like Javelins and Stinger missiles, that helped the Ukrainians repel the Russian aggression against Kyiv, push them back, and move the war to eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nWhat weve done all along, every step of the way since then, in coordination with all of our partners including Germany, is to try to assess what the Ukrainians needed at any given time, given the changing nature of the aggression moving to different parts of the country with different terrain, the Russians using different means to further their aggression. We have responded and adjusted and tried to get ahead of this every single time. And so, we went from, for example, providing Javelins and Stingers to HIMARS, which have proved so successful, the multi-launch rocket systems, to now an intense focus on air defenses, which is what the Ukrainians say they most need, and we agree.\n\nEvery country decides what it can and will contribute to this effort, and Germany has made major contributions in the provision of defense equipment and lethal assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to evaluate that as together as we go along. Were focused on what is it that Ukraine actually needs and can effectively use, including making sure that as we provide weapon systems to the Ukrainians, as necessary theyre trained on those systems and because in some instances were providing technology they havent used before they need to be trained on it, as well as making sure that they can maintain it, because some of the sophisticated equipment requires significant maintenance to keep it going and keeping it running.\n\nSo, for each and every piece of equipment, were making together those judgments, and thus far I think thats served Ukraine very well. Of course, it starts with the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian fighters, but what weve been able to provide them the United States, Germany, and many other partners and allies is what is making the difference.\n\nOn the question of tanks, we have no objection. In fact, we support any country, if it so decides, making those available if we make a determination that that can really help Ukraine and meet a need. But again, those are also judgments that were trying to make together collectively, including through the Ramstein process that Secretary of Defense Austin is leading.\n\nThank you.\n\nMR PATEL: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.",

                "cc_text": "It is no secret that arms control is becoming a lost art. While the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were filled with strategic arms control talks, only one treaty limiting nuclear arsenals has entered into force over the past two decades: New START (the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Notwithstanding the innovations in its verification regime, the treaty relied heavily on the existing principles of the original START Treaty, together with many of the core players experiences negotiating and ratifying it 20 years earlier.\n\nSince then, however, Russias Putin era and, with it, the growing distrust between Russia and the United States, as well as the retirement of Cold War and post-Cold War arms control experts, have stalled any progress. Other treaties such as the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF Treaty) have been abandoned, and other nuclear-armed states remain outside arms limitation agreements. Despite new technologies and a new security architecture requiring more thought than ever before, substantive proposals and good faith negotiations have been replaced by empty talking points. Additionally, in recent years both the United States and Russia have engaged in unconstructive blaming and shaming efforts, which have further soured the arms control environment and lowered the political will for pursuing negotiations in good faith.\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon advance proportional efforts to overcome these forces, it is only prudent to expect that February 4, 2026 will be the last day of bilateral strategic arms control (Albertson 2021, 78). As a first step, the United States and Russia, on August 25, 2022, submitted a statement to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT Review Conference) committing to \"pursue negotiations in good faith on a successor framework to New START before its expiration in 2026, in order to achieve deeper, irreversible, and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals\" (2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 2022). But that commitment so far appears to be blocked by the dispute over Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nTreaty history\n\n1972/1979: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II)\n\nNuclear arms limitation treaties emerged during a period of intense buildup of US and Soviet strategic nuclear forces. In the late 1960s, the United States realized that the Soviet Union was building up its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) forces to reach parity with the United States and had also begun to construct a limited anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense system around Moscow. Concerned that Russia might eventually be able to launch a first strike and then block US retaliation, President Lyndon Johnson called for strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The hope was that US-Soviet relations could be stabilized through limits on the development of both offensive and defensive strategic systems (US Department of State 2022).\n\nBy 1972, the Soviets were convinced that defensive systems had limitations, allowing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and SALT I to be negotiated and enter into force. SALT I was considered an interim agreement that consisted of a simple freeze, not yet including on-site inspections. Its verification relied on national technical means, referring to intelligence satellites and related capabilities. However, the term was officially left undefined to protect intelligence methods and avoid offending Soviet sensibilities (Gottemoeller 2021, 2; Aftergood 2019).\n\nIn 1979, the United States and the Soviet Union completed the negotiation of SALT II which set a limit of 2,400 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (including ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers), banned the construction of new ICBMs, and limited the number of multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to 1,320. However, the treaty never entered into force due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as well as some US senators criticisms of the Soviet Unions crackdown on internal dissent, the Soviets increasingly interventionist foreign policies, the treatys verification process, and SALT IIs failure to sufficiently limit Soviet MIRV technology that would allow missiles to carry multiple warheads (US Department of State n.d.; Cameron 2022). Nonetheless, both sides agreed to voluntarily observe the SALT II-negotiated limits in subsequent years (US Department of State n.d.).\n\nAs former US Secretary of Defense and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Gates noted, the process itself was likely the most useful part of these talks: \"For the first time, the two sides sat down and began a dialogue about their nuclear weapons and, implicitly, their nuclear strategies. Military and civilian leaders on both sides were able to take the measure of one another and, at the same time, engage their political leaders in an unprecedented way in learning about the balance of terror\" (Gates 1996, 45).\n\n1991: Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\n\nPartially due to the further development of MIRV technology on both sides, the Americans and Soviets realized that strategic systems had to be reduced to prevent either sides out-deployment in warhead numbers. This realization led to the 1980s Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), which eventually became the first ratified treaty that required US and Russian reductionsrather than a mere freezeof strategic nuclear weapons. The START Treaty, signed in 1991 with entry into force three years later, limited both countries to 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 6,000 warheads attributed to ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, and included more detailed sub-limits. Once Russia believed that the benefits of on-site inspections outweighed their concerns over giving the United States reciprocal access, nothing was standing in the way of a verifiable arms control treaty to create more predictability. The detailed verification regime of START, including databases, notifications, and on-site inspections, allowed both sides to better calculate necessary deterrence investments while preventing an arms race (Gottemoeller 2021, 3).\n\nThe United States and Russia subsequently negotiated and signed START II in 1993, committing to additional reductions down to 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers by the end of 2007. Importantly, the treaty included a ban on multiple warheads on ICBMs. While the treaty never entered into force despite a decade-long bilateral effort, it strongly shaped the US Strategic Commands long-term force structure planning (Kristensen 2001, 12).\n\n2002: the Moscow Treaty (SORT)\n\nUnder the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), also called the Moscow Treaty, Russia and the United States agreed in 2002 to further reduce their nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic warheads each by December 31, 2012a nearly two-third reduction from the START I limits. While progressive in its numerical limits, SORT was a very simple treaty, with its text barely exceeding one page and not providing any separate verification measures. Instead, Russia and the United States decided they would continue to rely on START to provide verification until its expiration in December 2009 (US Department of State 2002).\n\n2010: the New START Treaty\n\nFinally, the New START Treaty (officially the \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\") succeeded in further limiting the US- and Russian- deployed long-range nuclear forces down to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery vehiclesthe lowest in over 60 years. For that purpose, New START for the first time counted the actual number of warheads found on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, rather than mathematically calculating numbers based on missile tests as in START. Since bombers do not carry nuclear weapons under normal circumstances, each deployed heavy bomber was attributed one warhead by default to make bombers accountable under the treaty (US Department of State 2010). Therefore, the warheads attributed to bombers do not reflect actual warhead loadsunlike for missiles. Delivery vehicles under New START encompass deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear armaments. It was not until far into the negotiations that Russia and the United States determined these numbers, with Russia originally asking for more warheads while the United States requested more delivery vehicles to protect its advantage in that area (Gottemoeller 2021, 34).\n\nIn addition to the further reduction of these limits, New START created an entirely new limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers. Although this concept was originally introduced by Russia, the United States later embraced the idea as it would, first, prevent Russia from building and storing unlimited numbers of mobile missile launchers since these would count toward the non-deployed limit, and, second, provide the United States with the flexibility to convert bombers to conventional use and overhaul submarines since these would not count under the deployed limits during those processes (Gottemoeller 2021, 83, 112).\n\nAnother aspect of New STARTs flexibility is the preserved \"freedom to mix,\" where each side can decide the composition and structure of its strategic offensive forces if it stays below the total limits. Russia, being a great land power, could continue to rely primarily on ICBMs. On the contrary, the United States, being a sea power, was able to keep more SLBMs than Russia (Gottemoeller 2021, 32). The mix chosen by the United States included no more than 400 deployed ICBMs, no more than 240 deployed SLBMs, and no more than 60 deployed heavy bombers. Beyond an additional 100 non-deployed launchers, a significant number of excess launchers had to be denuclearized or destroyed. Because Russia had significantly fewer launchers than the United States, it did not have to reduce its deployed force.\n\nMost importantly, however, the New START Treaty created what has often been referred to as the \"gold standard\" of verification: procedures governing the conversion and elimination of strategic offensive arms, the establishment and operation of a database of treaty-required information, transparency measures, a commitment not to interfere with national technical means of verification, the exchange of telemetric information, the conduct of on-site inspection activities, and the operation of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) (US Department of State 2022).\n\nInnovations in New STARTs verification regime managed to address both sides concerns about the old START treatys verification regime while better balancing information and burdena core military interest on both sides.\n\nFirst, it streamlined STARTs more burdensome verification regime into two types of verifications: one for deployed systems (Type One) and the other for non-deployed systems (Type Two). They largely encompassed the aspects of previously separate types of inspectionsresulting in slightly longer but much less frequent (up to ten Type One and up to eight Type Two) short-notice on-site inspections annually. This solution fulfilled both militaries interest in avoiding too frequent or overly intrusive inspections that could disrupt operational tempo for days (Gottemoeller 2021, 50).\n\nSecond, it enabled real-time tracking of each others forces by introducing unique identifying numbers for launchers and delivery vehicles, utilizing the existing serial numbers each country already used to track and account for its weapons. This gave inspectors a clear idea of the weapons they needed to find at each site (Gottemoeller 2021, 52).\n\nThird, New START addressed rising cost and accuracy concerns about the conversion and elimination of certain weapon systems. To allow satellites to confirm eliminations, for instance, it determined space and time requirements for displaying eliminated missiles and other treaty accountable items and established the right to request reciprocal inspections of such. To address US concerns about overcounting delivery vehicles under the previous treaty, New START also introduced simplified measures to confirm US conversion and elimination processes, particularly the conversion of all B-1 bombers to conventional-only platforms, the conversion of submarine tubes, and the total elimination of B-52 bombers (Gottemoeller 2021, 121122).\n\nIn the end, while Russia had originally urged for a simpler treaty like SORT, it has praised New START as the \"gold standard\" for verification (Alexander and Ferraro 2010).\n\nThe treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011, and provided the parties with seven years to reduce their forces to these agreed-upon limits. Both sides successfully met the central limits by February 5, 2018, and have since stayed at or below them. Russia and the United States extended the originally 10-year treaty to its maximum 15-year length, now set to expire on February 4, 2026 (US Department of State 2022).\n\nTable 1 compares the limits and verification mea- sures from SALT I to New START.\n\nThe New START Treaty remains in force through February 4, 2026. If no follow-on agreement is concluded before its expiration, then February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals. In other words, anyone under the age of 54 will, for the first time, live in a world without strategic arms control.\n\nShort of a new treaty, Russia and the United States would lose mutual predictability and trust. It would also mean that military planners would have to rely more on worst-case scenarios, subsequently accelerating defense spending that could result in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nSuch a gloomy future is, of course, avoidable. The United States and Russia have several options available to maintain strategic limitations on their arsenals, includingin order of increasing resulting predictability but decreasing feasibilitycontinued adherence through mutual moratoria, the negotiation of a new executive agreement, or the conclusion of an entirely new treaty.\n\nWe explore each one of these three options in this issue. But, to illustrate the urgency with which both countries should pursue them, we first offer a realistic scenario of how US and Russian arsenals could evolve if the current trends remain unchangedthat is, if the last bilateral arms control treaty still active is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement.\n\nThe arms race in high gear\n\nUp until now, both countries have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that both countries will not exceed the force levels dictated by New START. Without bilateral arms control, however, this planning will be thrown into an era of unpredictability and distrust. Both sides would need to reassess their programs to accommodate more uncertain nuclear futures. This would likely result in worst-case scenario planning based on fewer data points and the uncertainty of future force levelsincluding those that would likely exceed New START levels. This could drive significant increases in both countries arsenals, and ultimately lead to mutual accusations of arms racing and international accusations of NPT violations.\n\nThe United States and Russia each have significant numbers of additional nuclear warheads in storage that cannot be loaded on the launchers because of the New START limit of 1,550 deployed warheads. If New START fell away, these warheads could be uploaded in days, weeks, or months, depending on the type of launcher.\n\nThe United States has a significant upload capacity for its deployed missiles. Although all 400 of its deployed ICBMs currently only carry a single warhead, 200 of these use the Mk-12A reentry vehicle and are therefore capable of carrying up to three W78 warheads each. Moreover, the United States has an additional 50 \"warm\" ICBM silos which could be reloaded with missiles if necessary. If the 200 Mk-12A-equipped missiles were uploaded to three warheads each and the 50 reloaded missiles were also equipped with three warheads each, the ICBM force loading could potentially increase from 400 to 950 warheads. In the absence of treaty limitations, the United States could also upload each of its deployed Trident SLBMs with a full complement of eight warheads, rather than the current average of four to five. It could also reactivate the four launch tubes on each nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN)56 in totalthat were disabled under New START. This could potentially more than double the number of deployed US SLBM warheads from approximately 944 today to approximately 2,300 warheads.\n\nEither of these actions would likely take months to complete, particularly given the complexities involved with uploading additional warheads on ICBMs. Moreover, ballistic missile submarines would have to return to port for uploading on a rotating schedule. However, deploying additional warheads to US bomber bases could be done very quickly, and the United States could potentially upload nearly 700 cruise missiles and bombs on B-52 and B-2 bombers.\n\nRussia also has a significant upload capacity, especially for its ICBMs. Russias 40 SS-18 Satan ICBMs can carry up to ten MIRVs; however, it is assumed that they have been downloaded to carry only five to meet the New START limitations. The incoming RS-28 Sarmat ICBM is also reportedly capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs; however, it is assumed that these too will be downloaded upon their deployment if the New START force limits are retained. The SS-27 Yars is also assumed to have been downloaded from four MIRVs to three. As a result, without the limits imposed by New START, Russias ICBM force could potentially increase from approximately 812 warheads to approximately 1,185 warheads.\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles on Russian Borei-class SSBNs are also thought to have been downloaded from an estimated six warheads to four to meet New START limits. Without these limitations, the number of deployed warheads on Russian SSBNs could rise from an estimated 576 to approximately 800. As in the US case, Russian bombers could be loaded relatively quickly with hundreds of nuclear weapons. The number is highly uncertain but assuming approximately 50 bombers are operational, the number of weapons could potentially be increased to nearly 600.\n\nTable 2 considers how both US and Russian strategic nuclear forces could increase if New START is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement in place. If both countries uploaded their delivery systems to accommodate the maximum number of possible warheads, both sets of arsenals would approximately double in size. The United States would have slightly more deployable strategic warheads but Russia would still have a significantly larger arsenal of operational nuclear weapons, given its sizable stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear warheads.\n\nTable 2 presents a worst-case scenario for possible warhead uploads if New START is allowed to expire without any follow-on. Because of the relatively low estimated cost of a simple upload across the triad (about $100 million in one-time costs to the United States), this scenario is not impossible from a budgeting perspective (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3).\n\nIn the longer term, both countries could theoretically go further and pursue costly larger expansions of their strategic nuclear forces, such as going back up to the START I level of 6,000 warheads each. Some voices in the United States have already raised doubts about the New START force limits because of Chinas nuclear buildup (Miller 2022). Depending on the desired degree of flexibility and the cost of new strategic delivery systems, such an expansion could cost the United States, for instance, between $88 billion to $439 billion in one-time acquisition costs, plus $4 billion to $28 billion in annual operation and sustainment costs (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3). This does not even include research and development costs or the Department of Energys costs to produce, sustain, or store more nuclear warheads. It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive.\n\nMoreover, there are expected consequences beyond the offensive strategic nuclear forces that New START regulates. If the verification regime and data exchanges elapse, both countries are likely to enhance their intelligence capabilities to make up for the uncertainty regarding the other sides nuclear forces. Both countries are also likely to invest more into what they perceive will increase their overall military capabilities, such as conventional missile forces, nonstrategic nuclear forces, and missile defense (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 79). These would all come with significant additional costs.\n\nOverall, todays technologies and the geopolitical situation would likely lead to a different style of arms racing than during the Cold War; however, it could similarly become unnecessarily costly and dangerous. Moreover, it could trigger reactions in other nuclear-armed states that might also decide to increase their nuclear forces and the role they play in their military strategies. The good news is that this future is certainly not inevitableeven without a formalized treaty structure beyond 2026. The following sections offer a series of options for both countries that would help prevent an escalation of the arms race. The estimated success of each option depends upon a variety of factors, including political will, legal complexities, and relative degrees of formalization. The following sections are listed in order of their projected feasibility, and thus begin with Plan Cthe most feasible but least sustainable optionand end with Plan A the most challenging yet most optimal outcome.\n\nPlan C: continued adherence to New STARTs core provisions beyond 2026\n\nOne option would be for both countries to simply continue abiding by the core provisions of the treatyeven without the treaty being formally in effect. Such a \"gentlemans agreement\" could be made by the leaders of both the United States and Russia without legislative approval, as opposed to a formal treaty. By agreeing to not exceed the New START limits, each side could continue its current strategic force structure planning and therefore avoid a costly expansion.\n\nSuch an agreement, however, also comes with challenges. Practically, the United States and Russia could certainly continue to adhere to the treaty limitsmuch as they did for a brief period of four months in the interim between START and New START. But without the legal structure of a treaty, the main verification benefits of New STARTdata exchanges, notifications, and inspections could be lost due to the legal difficulties surrounding classified information. This could force both parties to rely exclusively on national technical means for verification, which would severely strain both the resources and capabilities of their respective intelligence communities.\n\nWe now examine the feasibility of this option.\n\nCould bilateral data exchanges and notifications continue after 2026?\n\nWithout a treaty framework to enable the legal exchange of otherwise classified or restricted nuclear weapons data, both Russia and the United States would need to prepare legal avenues to allow them to continue sharing this information. According to former New START chief US negotiator, Rose Gottemoeller, the United States continued notifications as a goodwill gesture and was willing to continue data exchanges during the bridge period between START and New START (Gottemoeller 2022). Given this precedent, it should again be feasible for the United States to legally arrange for data exchanges and notifications. On the other side, Russia did not continue reciprocal notifications during the interim period, despite its promise to continue abiding by the treatys limits. To that end, Russia will need to examine whether it might need to first amend its domestic laws concerning the sharing of classified nuclear information.\n\nCould bilateral on-site inspections continue after 2026?\n\nThe question of on-site inspections continuing beyond the scope of a formalized treaty has been considered by Gottemoeller. In her book, Negotiating the New START Treaty, she notes that:\n\n\"The Russians also raised doubts about the legal status of such an agreement. According to them, they needed a full, legally-binding treaty, duly approved by their State Duma and Federation Council, in order to override their domestic law and permit foreign inspectors. According to the Russian state security law, no foreigners are allowed in sensitive nuclear facilities. A treaty can override that domestic law\" (Gottemoeller 2021, 8586).\n\nThe United States also has laws restricting the access of foreign nationals to sensitive military installations. These too could be overridden by an international treaty, as has been the case with New START.\n\nIt would theoretically be possible for both countries to change their domestic laws to enable on-site inspections to continue in the absence of a treaty framework. There is precedent for attempting this in the United States: In 2009, facing the possibility that START might expire without a follow-on treaty in place, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) brought to the table a bill specifically designed to provide Russian inspectors with the ability to continue on-site inspections for seven months or until the entry into force of a new bilateral treatywhichever came first (S.2727 2009). The bill was ultimately not passed, but its introduction to Congress suggests that a similar path could be considered again if necessary. Such a bill could specifically require the continued implementation of the expired treatys verification protocol and annexes that contain highly detailed instructions for how on-site inspections are to be conducted, including requisite flight paths, aircraft call signs, customs exemptions, lodging, accommodations, and the according of diplomatic immunity upon each partys inspectors and aircrew, among other granular details.\n\nIn the absence of a follow-on treaty, rather than attempting to maintain all existing verification mechanisms, another option could be to reduce the scope of the verification regime altogether. While conventional wisdom holds that more verification is always better, recent scholarship indicates that this may not always be the case. In his doctoral dissertation, political scientist Andrew Reddie posits that \"the most intrusive types of verification are not, as is currently believed, more likely to lead to compliance\" (Reddie 2019). Instead, Reddies analysisbased on more than 1,000 agreement-years of historical datasuggests that highly intrusive inspections could yield a statistically significant greater likelihood of noncompliance than less intrusive types of verification regimes. Reddie suggests that this phenomenon could be the result of a \"surveillance bias,\" in which it is possible that \"a hammer (representing a verification regime) will constantly search for and find a nail (noncompliance). Thus, those agreements that have a more stringent verification mechanisma larger hammermay have a higher probability of detecting non-compliance\" (Reddie 2019).\n\nIf a reduction in the intrusiveness of the treatys verification regime would not necessarily increase the likelihood of noncompliance, both parties could use the opportunity of New STARTs expiration to possibly reduce the invasiveness of future verification mechanisms. This would avoid unwanted challenges triggered by the loss of the treatys inspection protocols once it expires while continuing to adhere to its core provisions and central limits. For example, the United States and Russia could place a hold on conducting Type One and Type Two inspections but continue to exchange compliance data and promise not to interfere with the other partys national technical means of verification.\n\nEven though after New START expires there would be no legal requirement to comply with the treatys core provisions, both countries would still likely have strong normative and geopolitical incentives to continue doing so. This is partially because of the riskeven without on-site inspectionsthat any increase would be detected and exposed by the other sides national technical means. Moreover, during the treatys history, there have been several extended periods when Type One and Type Two inspections were suspendedmost notably during the Covid-19 pandemic, when inspections were paused for nearly two years. During these periods there were no accusations of noncompliance by either side.\n\nA reduction of the verification regime may not necessarily create a compliance problem, but it could create a political one. Historically, Congress has been more amenable to support and provide the resources to implement agreements with robust verification regimes, whereas agreements with relatively looser verification mechanisms, such as SORT or the US-Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have faced fierce resistance. This challenge could be exacerbated by relying exclusively on national technical means for verification, which could potentially result in the intelligence community issuing ranged estimates of Russian warheads and delivery systems rather than knowing the exact numbers of warheads and launchers. Even though using a range in place of a definite number may not significantly affect the United States deterrence calculations, it could produce a domestic political backlash. For instance, if the ranges upper boundary ever came too close to the treatys central limits, the public debate would most likely crystalize over such a high-end estimate and cast doubt about Russias compliance. This challenge is evident in the current debate about how many non-strategic nuclear warheads Russia has. Because these warheads are not limited and declared under a treaty, the US Intelligence Community uses a range of 1,0002,000 warheads, of which the Pentagon uses the higher number, even though the Department of State says it includes retired warheads (US Department of State 2022, 11).\n\nUnder such a \"gentlemans agreement,\" any previously existing protocols to facilitate dispute resolution between the state parties would no longer be formally in effect. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC)the joint body authorized to resolve compliance questions, make technical changes to the treatys protocol and annexes as new weapons are deployed, and mediate other treaty-related disputeswould be officially defunct upon New STARTs expiration. As a result, if one party accused the other of materially breaching the agreement, there would be no formal mechanism for mediating and resolving that dispute. This challenge could be mitigated by the establishment of a new mechanism that mirrors the current role of the BCC.\n\nIn effect, continuing to adhere to New STARTs core provisions would be an informal way of extending the treatys benefits. While this informality would certainly create challenges, the tacit knowledge and practices learned through 15 years of successful New START implementation could help transition both parties into such a new framework. While this option may not be sustainable in the long term, it could be considered a short-term bridge between New START and a follow-on agreement. This could prove particularly useful in the interim period if a mutual political commitment to the treaty remains, but time runs out before a new agreement can be concluded.\n\n*************\n\nAnother obstacle to a non-legally binding handshake agreement is Russias historical insistence on having formally ratified treaties. For instance, Gottemoeller explained that Russia previously rejected a non-legally-binding bridging agreement after START, as it was afraid this would take away the necessary pressure needed to eventually reach a ratified treaty with the United States (Gottemoeller 2022). Russias insistence on formally ratified treaties may also be motivated by its fear that a future US administration could easily pull out of a negotiated executive deal. It is not known how flexible Russia might be today given the diminished likelihood that a two-thirds majority of the US Senate will vote to ratify an arms control treaty with Russia, particularly in the context of Putins invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPlan B: pursuing an executive agreement\n\nAnother option for the United States could be to conclude a follow-on (sole presidential or congressional) executive agreement that would not require the Senates advice and consent for ratification as an Article II treaty would, but would still be as legally binding. Today, more than 90 percent of the United States international agreements are executive agreements concluded by the president (Bradley and Goldsmith 2018, 1278). In the field of arms control, however, executive agreements are still largely unexplored.\n\nA distinctive advantage of pursuing an executive agreement over an Article II treaty is that it would allow each countrys head of state to bypass the Senates advice and consent required for Article II treaty ratification. This would be particularly valuable for the United States given the high degree of political polarization and low likelihood of bipartisan Senate support.\n\nThe flip side of this advantage for the United States, however, is that bypassing Congress in this way could create political backlash for a president. Congress could potentially block funding for a president to implement an executive agreement with Russia or even hold other presidential priorities at risk.\n\nMoreover, if such an executive agreement included anything that could be construed to be a \"further arms reduction,\" it could be challenged under the US Arms Control and Disarmament Act:\n\n\"No action shall be taken pursuant to this chapter or any other Act that would obligate the United States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution or unless authorized by the enactment of further affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States\" (22 USC Ch. 35, Section 2573(b) 1961).\n\nA sole-presidential executive agreement inherently has substantially less congressional buy-in than a treaty ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. Similar to politically-binding agreements, such an executive agreement is likely to be associated directly with the president who concluded it and could therefore be subject to violation or withdrawal by a subsequent president wanting to distinguish themselves from their predecessor. The fate of the JCPOA between the United States and Iranin this case a politically- and not legally-binding agreementexemplifies this dynamic. In 2018, against the advice of nonproliferation experts and many of his own advisors, President Donald Trump violated the agreement mainly because of its association with his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who signed the deal in 2015. This can be contrasted with the fate of New START, which was also negotiated under the Obama administration but remained relatively insulated from President Trumps pattern of withdrawing from treaties and agreementspartly because of New STARTs continued bipartisan support within Congress, particularly from those who voted in favor of the treaty in 2010.\n\nA more politically-sound and -sustainable solution might be a congressional executive agreement that would require a simple majority vote in both the Senate and House.\n\nPlan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\n\nThe ideal option for maintaining transparency, predictability, and mutual limitations of US and Russian nuclear arsenals would be the conclusion of a follow-on treaty to replace New START. That is also the least feasible option, especially as bilateral talks have been placed on hold since Russia invaded Ukraine. Nonetheless, a thorough consideration of each countrys respective arms control priorities could yield some opportunities for common ground when negotiations eventually resume.\n\nIn June 2022, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, Mallory Stewart, described the United States current arms control priorities vis--vis Russia as follows: \"We want to sustain limits beyond 2026 on the Russian systems covered under new START; we want to limit the new kinds of nuclear systems Russia is developing; and we want to address all Russian nuclear weapons, including theater-range weapons\" (Stewart 2022).\n\nPriority one: maintaining strategic limits after New START\n\nThe United States first prioritysustaining mutual limitations beyond 2026is likely to be shared by Russia. Both countries are aware of each others significant strategic upload capacities upon New STARTs expiration, such that each country could more than double their total deployed strategic war- heads in the absence of existing limitations (see \"The arms race in high gear\" section). However, neither side appears to have the political appetite or economic capacity to engage in a strategic arms buildup.\n\nRussias significant interest in preserving the bilateral arms control regime was on full display in the months and weeks leading up to New STARTs extension in 2021. As Andrey Baklitskiy wrote at the time for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace:\n\n\"Both chambers of parliament voted on the extension in just one day, and passed it unanimously. Such speed and consensuslast seen over the annexation of Crimea back in 2014shows how important arms control is to the Russian leadership. [. . .] Recently, it has become fashionable in Russias expert circles to opine that traditional arms control is obsolete as a concept, and doesnt correspond to the reality of the modern world. This view partly stems from the fact that existing treaties have disappeared one after the other, while Moscow has not held talks on a new one for more than a decade. The energy the Russian state has put into supporting arms control efforts, along with the first progress made on this front, could now put an end to that trend\" (Baklitskiy 2021).\n\nPriority two: addressing Russias \"exotic\" new nuclear systems\n\nThe United States second prioritylimiting Russias newer nuclear systemswill pose a greater challenge than maintaining the existing limits beyond 2026, but not an insurmountable one. In March 2018, President Putin unveiled a suite of \"exotic\" new nuclear systemsincluding the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, and the Status-6 Poseidon nuclear torpedoimmediately prompting concerns from US lawmakers that these systems would not be covered by New START limitations (President of Russia 2018; Cotton 2019).\n\nWhile some of these systems do pose arms control challenges, two of themSarmat and Avangardappear to be covered by the treaty. The New START protocols have clear provisions for including \"new types\" of strategic ICBMs within the framework of the treaty, and given that Sarmat has already been tested and is scheduled to be deployed by the end of 2022, Russia will have already provided many of the requisite prototype notifications to the United States (Al Jazeera 2022). In a similar vein, the United States incoming LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM will also enter the treaty smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, Avangard is not a particularly complex case: the hypersonic glide vehicle is carried by treaty-accountable ICBMs and the system itself meets New STARTs definition of a \"re-entry vehicle\" under the description \"that part of the front section that can survive reentry through the dense layers of the Earths atmosphere and that is designed for delivering a weapon to a target or for testing such a delivery\" (US Department of State 2010, 60(7)). As a result, any ICBMs deployed with the Avangard system are now counted toward the central limits for both launchers and warheads.\n\nBoth the United States and Russia seem to agree on how New START will consider these two systems. In 2019, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Andrea Thompson, stated in congressional testimony that: \"We assess at least two of them, the Sarmat heavy ICBM and Avangard hypersonic system would count as existing types and be subject to New START at the appropriate point in their development cycle\" (Thompson 2019). Six months later, the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministrys nonproliferation and arms control department, Vladimir Leontiev, stated at the Valdai Discussion Club:\n\n\"As far as new Russian systems are concerned, the situation is dual. There are two systems that clearly fall under the treaty. First, the Sarmat, which can be easily included in the treaty as a new type ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile), for which there is a special procedure, from the creation of a prototype to its authorization for service. [. . .] There are no big problems with Avangard, either, because it is an optional warhead for an ICBM of the corresponding type, to which the treaty applies, too. [. . .] The Avangard will enter the Treaty very smoothly\" (TASS 2019).\n\nThe statuses of the three other new Russian delivery systemsBurevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhalare less obvious. Neither Burevestnik nor Poseidon are likely to be deployed before New STARTs expiration in February 2026; however, it is worth examining whether any of these would fall under the treatys existing counting rules, given that these could form the basis for a potential follow-on agreement.\n\nArticle V of New START stipulates that: \"When a Party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging, that Party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the Bilateral Consultative Commission.\" The treatys supplementary protocol specifies what constitutes a \"new\" kind of strategic offensive weapon:\n\n\"The term new type means, for ICBMs or SLBMs, a type of ICBM or a type of SLBM, the technical characteristics of which differ from the technical characteristics of an ICBM or SLBM, respectively, of each type declared previously in at least one of the following respects: (a) Number of stages. (b) Type of propellant of any stage. (c) Either the length of the assembled missile without front section or the length of the first stage, by more than three percent. (d) Diameter of the first stage, by more than three percent\" (US Department of State 2010, 46(42)).\n\nIt is unclear whether this definition applies to any of Burevestnik, Poseidon, or Kinzhal, given that none could be considered ICBMs or SLBMs. Burevestnik is a cruise missile, Poseidon is a type of underwater torpedo, and Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile. Moreover, at least two of these systems do not travel on ballistic trajectories, placing them outside the treatys definition of either an \"intercontinental ballistic missile\" or a \"submarine-launched ballistic missile,\" regardless of their launch systems or strategic roles in Russias nuclear arsenal.\n\nHowever, in 2019, then-Under Secretary Thompson added during her congressional testimony that all three \"meet the US criteria for what constitutes a new kind of strategic offensive arms for purposes of New START\" (Thompson 2019).\n\nThis interpretation is not likely to be shared by Russia. In December 2018, Russian officials sent a notice to the United States stating that they \"find it inappropriate to characterize new weapons being developed by Russia that do not use ballistic trajectories of flight moving to a target as potential new kinds of Russian strategic offensive arms. The arms presented by the President of the Russian Federation on March 1, 2018, have nothing to do with the strategic offensive arms categories covered by the Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nIn its notice, Russia asserted that because none of the Burevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhal delivery systems are ICBMs, SLBMs, or heavy bombers, they fall outside the scope of the treaty. The statement also noted that \"the Russian approach to the issue of criteria for defining new kinds of strategic offensive arms for the purposes of this Treaty is being worked at. The Russian Side is open for dialogue on this topic although it does not consider it as a priority taking into account pressing issues of the Treaty implementation discussed currently in the Bilateral Consultative Commission\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nThe complex case for counting Kinzhal under the treaty framework depends entirely upon whether its carrier aircraft fits the treaty definition of an accountable \"heavy bomber.\" The treatys protocol states that an aircraft counts as a \"heavy bomber\" if it either (a) has a combat (meaning unrefueled) range of more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) or (b) is equipped for nuclear air-launched cruise missiles with a range exceeding 600 kilometers (370 miles) (US Department of State 2010, 23(80)). Given that Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile, it does not satisfy the latter criterion. However, depending on how Russia intends to deploy the system, it could satisfy the former criterion.\n\nRussia deploys Kinzhal on its specially-modified MiG-31IK Foxhound aircraft and has used the system in combat at least three times during its invasion of Ukraine (Kristensen and Korda 2022a; TASS 2022). The MiG-31IKs combat range is estimated to be approximately 1,250 kilometers (770 miles)significantly below the 8,000-kilometer threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000a). As Pranay Vaddi, now Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, wrote in 2019 for Lawfare: \"In this case, Kinzhal would not be accountable under New START, and neither should it be. Because the MiG-31 has a very limited range, it is not, even when armed with Kinzhal, the kind of strategic weapon that New START was intended to limit. Rather, if Kinzhal is deployed on a MiG-31, it will likely fill a limited, theater-strike role\" (Vaddi 2019).\n\nHowever, news reports have indicated that Russia may also deploy Kinzhal on its longer-range Tu-22M3M Backfire bombers (TASS 2018; RIA Novosti 2018). The upgraded Tu-22M3Ms are currently not classified as \"heavy bombers\" under New START because they are estimated to have a combat range of approximately 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles), whichif correctremains below the 8,000-kilometer (4,971 miles) threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000b). The United States raised concerns about the upgraded Tu-22M3M system to Russia in September 2018, to which Russia responded as follows:\n\n\"The Russian side indeed plans to carry out modernization of Tu-22M3 bomber to the modification Tu-22M3M. This modernization will prolong the service life of the aircraft, as well as improve its systems of maneuverability, navigation and use of air weapon systems. At the same time, the range of the bomber will be below 8000 km, and it will not be equipped for nuclear [air-launched cruise missiles] with range exceeding 600 km. Proceeding from the aforementioned facts, the technical characteristics of the Tu-22M3M aircraft in accordance with paragraph 23 (80) of Part One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty do not allow to classify it as a heavy bomber and it will not fall under the limitations of the New START Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nWhile the combat range of the upgraded Tu-22M3M may remain below 8,000 kilometers, it appears that the modernized aircraft will likely have probes to facilitate mid-air refueling (Interfax 2018). This is a significant alteration of the aircraft that will allow it to potentially reach intercontinental ranges. For this reason, these probes had been previously removed from Russias Tu-22M aircraft under the SALT II process, and the Soviet Union had made a politically binding declaration on July 31, 1991, that \"it will not give the Tu-22M airplane the capability of operating at intercontinental distances in any manner, including by in-flight refueling\" (Vance 1979; US Department of State 1991). However, this long-standing policy appears to now have been reversed, with defense sources telling Interfax in 2018 that: \"The new refueling equipment will significantly increase Tu-22M3Ms combat radius and range of operation. The range will be comparable with one of strategic bombers\" (Interfax 2018).\n\nWhile this may not technically trigger the reclassification of the Kinzhal/Tu-22M3M combination as a treaty-accountable \"heavy bomber\" given that the aircrafts unrefueled range is still likely to remain below the 8,000-kilometer threshold, the de facto transformation of a medium-range aircraft into an intercontinental-range aircraft could be enough for the United States to raise the matter at the BCC or in other bilateral forums. Moreover, in the context of negotiating a follow-on treaty, the United States could seek to close this potential loophole by addressing the fact that mid-flight refueling capabilities could theoretically turn a tactical bomber into a strategic one.\n\nPriority three: addressing all Russian nuclear weapons\n\nThe United States third prioritylimiting all of Russias nuclear weaponslikely poses the greatest challenge given the difficulty of verification and existing force asymmetry.\n\nThe United States is likely aware of the challenge, thus phrasing its goal to \"address all Russian nuclear weapons\" rather broadly. This could, for a start, be achieved through unverified data exchanges. Nonetheless, any negotiations that concern non-strategic nuclear warheads will be complicated by the asymmetry of Russia having up to 10 times more non-strategic nuclear warheads than the United States (1,912 compared to 200) (Kristensen and Korda 2022a, 2022b). Were Russia willing to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in a treaty, it would likely ask for US concessions in another area, although it has not specified so far what this might be. The Russian government did state, however, that a precondition for discussing non-strategic nuclear weapons is that the United States withdraws such weapons from Europe (Berestovaya 2021). Other areas of asymmetry Russia could try to pull into a negotiation package might concern US missile defenses and conventional weapons.\n\nExacerbated by existing political tensions and the current arms control deadlock between the two countries, this issue is not likely to be resolved anytime soon. Rather, an effort to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in an arms control treaty could require several years of negotiations and confidence-buildingpossibly spanning multiple presidential administrations.\n\nLessons learned and next steps\n\nTo address the challenges of building a follow-on framework, we now look at the lessons learned from previous arms control negotiations and identify strategies the United States might follow to eventually achieve a successful outcome.\n\nClarify national security interests and identify corresponding arms control tools\n\nIt is common wisdom that arms control is not an end in itself, but is instead a means to ensure national security. In this view, any future arms control negotiations need to be preceded by a thorough reevaluation of the national security interests they are meant to achieve. During the Cold War, arms control worked in tandem with deterrence and other elements of national power to manage strategic competition. When the Cold War ended, the role of arms control changed to a collaborative tool to manage, first, a controlled drawdown of excess strategic forces, then, deep cuts of nuclear forces, and eventually, elimination. With the pendulum swinging back to strategic competition, arms control may once again have to serve principally as a tool to manage strategic competition. It is therefore important to address expectations about what arms control can tangibly achieve in the coming years.\n\nAs noted above, US officials and leading nuclear scholars have repeatedly listed the following as problems that arms control should address: the loss of transparency with Russia, Chinas buildup, new weapons, risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation, and the deterioration of international norms. This section explores how the United States should prioritize these issues given the return to strategic competition, and which arms control tools it should rely on for each.\n\nFirst, with the war in Ukraine and the generally growing risk of regional conflicts involving China or Russia, the United States most pressing interest should be to minimize the risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation. The United States time would likely not be wasted here as ensuring \"nonevents\" constitutes \"a strong mutual interest among the United States, Russia, and China\" (Talmadge 2022). Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021). Given Putins escalatory language regarding Ukraine, these measureswhich luckily do not require a formal treatycannot wait any further. In the short term, they would complement New START. In the intermediate term, they would provide some limited, but much-needed confidence should there be no immediate follow-on treaty. In the longer term, risk reduction efforts may \"create opportunities for the parties to address and resolve those security concerns that are blocking the path to nuclear disarmament\" (Woolf 2021).\n\nSecond, the United States should prioritize preventing the loss of transparency regarding Russian strategic nuclear weapons as these continue to comprise most nuclear weapons that can reach the US homeland. In the medium-term, these are still owned by Russia, not China. New STARTs verification and monitoring regime continues to be a highly suitable tool in this regard, because it allows the United States to track the numbers, types, sizes, locations, readiness, and movements of these weapons. This information helps avoid misunderstandings and worst-case planning assumptions that would otherwise fuel a new arms race. It would therefore be in the United States best interest to continue a similar mutual verification and monitoring regime of offensive strategic nuclear forces. For non-strategic nuclear weapons, data declarations would likely be the most suitable transparency tool to address the United States concerns for now. Issues surrounding intrusiveness and feasibility make a fully verifiable framework for these weapons rather difficult absent the necessary political will.\n\nThird, given the US bipartisan concern with Russian treaty violations and the resulting deterioration of international norms, it is within US interest to revitalize the latter. The value of any future arms control treaty or agreement diminishes if it becomes common practice to simply violate them or exit them on a whim. Therefore, to ensure that arms control negotiations are worth the effort and that their value does not disappear overnight, it will be essential to revive international norms surrounding nonproliferation. This could be achieved through bilateral and multilateral normative statements, use of doctrine and strategy dialogues, as well as various tools to increase exit costsincluding treaty provisions and allied, or ideally multilateral, commitments to sanction noncompliant parties.\n\nFinally, how do the traditional tools of arms controllimitations and reductionshold up today? Deep numerical reductions are unlikely without Russian and Chinese participation, given the level of prior reductions, expectations of cheating, and especially the new geopolitical order with Chinas growing military power and nuclear arsenal. However, all three countries need to do their best to overcome these forces as soon as possible and fulfill their disarmament obligations under the NPT. Regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons thatunlike strategic weaponsdo not pose a direct threat to each countrys homeland, reductions would not solve the most pressing concern: escalation through first use in a regional, conventional conflict (such as in Ukraine). Any remaining nuclear warheads could still be used first and risk escalation. For this reason, it is important to realize that reductions themselves should be a longer-term interest, and need to be complemented by other arms control tools such as the ones mentioned earlier. More immediate concerns regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons would be better addressed through risk reduction tools, transparency measures, and the strengthening of international norms.\n\nDespite the limitations of traditional arms control tools, however, the United States (and Russia) would continue to benefit from the force predictability if limits on launchers and warheads remained. Opponents of arms control have for a long time tried to argue that these limits lead to decreased deterrence because it makes the United States reduce its nuclear forces while Russia keeps proportionally investing more into modernizing theirs (Trachtenberg 2021, 7). But changes in deterrence are largely the result of countries having different military doctrines rather than the treaties provisions. For instance, Russia relies more on its nuclear arsenal given its conventional forces inferiority. Today, given the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear triad and its higher number of strategic launchers and larger inventory of strategic nuclear warheads, the United States should feel confident that its deterrent will be preserved in respect to Russia under continued limits on launchers and warheads.\n\nThe key challenge is how Chinas growing nuclear arsenal will affect these numerical and qualitative assessments of the US-Russian balance. Is the credibility of the US nuclear deterrent reduced because of Chinas buildup? Will it undermine the US-Russian balance? If the United States increases its nuclear arsenal, will that cause either Russia or China to increase theirs even more? \"The challenge will then be to redress Russias and Chinas worst-case assessments that the capabilities the United States deploys to deter both countries could or would be used to defeat either one of them. If new approaches to arms control cannot be invented, the world is likely to see worsening security dilemmas, arms racing, and instability\" (Dalton et al. 2022, 13).\n\nBeyond that, future negotiators will likely want to focus on issues other than simple numerical reductions of launchers and warheads, such as the asymmetry in the nuclear production complexesthe roots of the nuclear warhead tree (Albertson 2022, 66). China, concerned about the survivability of its nuclear forces, may be reluctant to agree to fissile material production cut-offs. Because these concerns are partially driven by US missile defenses, it might, however, be open to combining this issue with a moratorium on the deployment of space-based missile defenses, the most plausible means for the United States to undermine Chinas nuclear deterrent (Acton, MacDonald, and Vaddi 2021, 5152).\n\nBuild arms control expertise\n\nTo have any chance at preventing the loss of strategic arms controls benefits and develop remedies to safeguard strategic stability, the US government will need to make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise.\n\nOne important factor that contributed to the arms control achievements in the mid-1980s to 1990s was the amount of expertise in the executive and legislative branches. Those who lived through the Cold War were naturally more concerned with, and educated on, nuclear weapons issues. Moreover, Congress still took its role in foreign policy seriously, and the Senate engaged in arms control through the bipartisan Arms Control Observer Group. For instance, Senate members of this group were tasked to consult with and advise US arms control negotiating teams, and \"to monitor and report to the Senate on the progress and development of negotiations\" (Roth 2014).\n\nToday, however, most of these arms control experts in the executive branch and Senate have retired or in other ways moved on. Current staff has not been able to benefit from the direct experience and on-the-job training of the negotiating, ratification, implementation, and verification processes. The New START Treaty negotiations were the last to benefit from the contributions of the remaining experts and champions from this era (Albertson 2021, 78). The Senate, while still somewhat engaged in the New START negotiations through the National Security Working Group, has largely lost the expertise from the days of the more-engaged Senate Arms Control Observer Groupdue to increased partisanship, diminished prestige, and the GOPs growing skepticism of legally binding international commitments (Roth 2014).\n\nTo regain the interest and expertise needed to think through todays arms control issues, the US government should (1) make significant staffing, training, and retention investments; and (2) increase cooperation and exchange between Congress and the executive branch again. The latter could be achieved possibly through a revitalized congressionally-appointed liaison group as former Sen. Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz previously proposed (Nunn and Moniz 2017).\n\nAlthough much of the deep technical expertise needed to develop effective arms control tools will require access to classified information, these efforts can, to some degree, be pursued in concert with civil society. External funding provided by foundations and philanthropic organizations has traditionally played an instrumental role in hiring, training, and empowering future generations of arms control experts. Many of these experts typically rotate through government at some point during their careers, and they rely on their external networks to both brainstorm new arms control ideas and build support for them in the public discourse. To that end, increased funding for civil society could play a pivotal role in fostering the deep bench of political and technical experts needed to pursue successful arms control negotiations in the future.\n\nDemonstrate Presidential leadership\n\nIt is likely that the chances of any follow-up agreement will be closely related to the degree of presidential lea-dership, support, and involvement in the negotiations, even if such an agreement is ratified in Congress and is not an executive agreement. It is essential to articulate national security objectives at the highest level as soon as possible in the process. If leaders are engaged throughout, the rest of the government will set it as a priority (Gottemoeller 2021, 172).\n\nRose Gottemoeller, the US lead negotiator of New START, assesses that the greatest asset to the treatys negotiations was the willingness of both US President Barack Obama and Russia President Dmitry Medvedev to engageand to use their knowledge about treaty issues. The opening of the New START formal negotiations can arguably be attributed to a US-Russian presidential joint statement that laid out the subject and scope of the new agreement. Two months after the first round of meetings, another presidential joint understanding that contained limit ranges likely enabled the negotiators to operate at a relatively quick pace.\n\nMoreover, there was great and important progress when President Obama and President Medvedev agreed on final warhead and delivery vehicle limits during a side meeting at the 2009 Climate Summit in Copenhagen (Gottemoeller 2021, 46, 89, 91). Throughout these and other arms control negotiations, Russian negotiators have in the past been more likely to consider concrete proposals when they came from a presidential level.\n\nFinally, given the Russians skills at slow-rolling, both presidents agreeing on the same timeline was vital to the relatively timely success of the New START negotiations.\n\nPresidential backing, first, ignited the talks and, second, saved much time by allowing the negotiators to focus on the agreed-upon scope. In the context of a future follow-on agreement, it could be possible to negotiate a technical framework using interagency guidance before any public summit if the political environment is too challenging. It is clear that presidential leadership throughout the New START negotiations provided the delegations on both sides with the needed bureaucratic firepower to get things done quickly, and helped move negotiations along when they were seemingly stuck.\n\nUnderstand the other side: Russia\n\nOn the Russian side, it is critical to understand the role that nuclear weapons play in their politics, military strategy, andperhaps most importantlyits perception of itself as a nation (Williams 2016). Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, describes well the crucial role of such an understanding in a report describing his unprecedented visits to Russias nuclear complex in 1992:\n\n\"We quickly discovered that the Russian view of its nuclear enterprise could not have been more radically different than the prevailing American view. Our Russian colleagues and the nuclear ministry viewed their nuclear weapons and nuclear complex as the crowning achievement of Soviet times and essential to Russias political, scientific, and economic future. With Russias conventional forces having atrophied, nuclear weapons were viewed as their guarantor of sovereignty, assuring Moscow a seat at the international table. Nuclear materials were seen as an economic resource and a national treasure. Nuclear experts and their scientific institutions were seen as an engine for the recovery of the national economy\" (Hecker 2017, 6).\n\nIn the 30 years since these visits, Russias view of its nuclear enterprise has not changed much, particularly considering the poor performance of its conventional forces in conflicts, epitomized by its current war against Ukraine. But perhaps surprisingly, this imbalance may be a boon for arms control given that Russia has typically viewed its participation in such negotiations as evidence of its \"great power\" status. Additionally, Russia may view a renewed arms control agreement as a pathway toward renegotiating the global geopolitical order on its own terms. As a result, Russia is likely to view arms control in a relatively positive light compared to other nuclear-armed states like China.\n\nAlthough Russia is likely to be relatively amenable to the prospect of nuclear negotiations (as suggested by their quick extension of New START in 2021), they, like the United States, will not enter into agreements unless these serve their national security interests. Several key Russian security concerns may need to be addressed to ensure a successful follow-on agreement.\n\nChief among these concerns is the development of advanced US missile defenses. Russia has long regarded the limitation of anti-ballistic missiles as the \"cornerstone of strategic stability,\" and has often explicitly characterized missile defense limits as a precondition to strategic arms control. In 2000, President Vladimir Putin noted that \"the mutual reduction of strategic attack weapons . . . is possible only when the ABM Treaty continues to hold\" (Woolf 2002). Additionally, throughout the New START negotiations, Russian negotiators attempted on several occasions to bring the issue of missile defense to the tableparticularly following pressure from Putin, for whom missile defense was a priority issue (Gottemoeller 2021, 97).\n\nGiven the advancements in US defensive capabilities and Putin being back in the presidential seat today, it is likely that Russia will continue pressing the issue of US missile defenses. As Russia has historically been highly effective at drawing out negotiations, they may initially insist again on US concessions in this areabut they should hopefully recognize that it would not be worth jeopardizing strategic offensive arms control over the issue.\n\nIf Russia refuses to yield, however, the United States could again offer to place some limits on its missile defenses as part of a negotiation. At present, the US missile defense architecture appears to be an ever-evolving, open-ended projectrather than a clearly-defined effort to reach specific deterrence objectives. This has been recently underscored by increasingly blurred lines between theater and homeland defenses, as well as President Trumps assertion that US missile defense will continue to evolve to \"detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace\" (Sonne 2019). These factors likely validate the concerns of Russian strategists who largely never believed previous US assurances about the limited nature of their defenses (Woolf 2002).\n\nTo that end, the United States could consider establishing clear goals and limitations for its missile defense architecture, clearly communicate them to Russia, and then assess which constraints would be acceptable to unblock the path toward strategic arms control. Such constraints would not necessarily have to affect existing US capabilities but could involve placing a cap on interceptors at a higher level than what is currently deployed (Arbatov 2021). Given Chinas similar concerns about US defenses, such actions could potentially also help bring China to the negotiating table.\n\nFinally, regarding one of the United States core concernsnonstrategic nuclear weaponsRussia has so far repeatedly posed preconditions to even begin talks that have been perceived as a pretext to avoid negotiations: the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and the elimination of NATOs nuclear-sharing arrangements and related infrastructure. While the Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons posture has been transitioning to a combination of assets in support of specific missions, the Russian military, political leadership, and elites still believe that Russia needs a larger non-strategic nuclear weapons force than does NATO. This is primarily because Russia sees its non-strategic nuclear weapons to some extent as compensation for the larger US strategic nuclear arsenal.\n\nBecause Russia is unlikely to agree to equal ceiling and intrusive verification measures, a phased approach starting with transparency measures would be more promising. However, Russia might be susceptible to an effort to put its 2020 political commitment to freeze its nuclear stockpile back on the table (Pomper et al. 2022, 4647). In the longer term, to overcome Russias perceived need to compensate for having less strategic nuclear weapons, actual reductions might need to wait for future negotiations including the United Kingdom, France, and China (against whom Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons could be used in a strategic way).\n\nUnderstand the other side: China\n\nThe Chinese side is more difficult to understand. First, China has never engaged in nuclear arms control talks with the United Statesunlike Russia, with which the United States has half a century of experience. Second, while China formally maintains a no-first-use policy, doctrinal debates are still ongoing about the limits of this policy (Leveringhaus 2022). To make matters worse, the security concerns related to the two countrys growing competition have restricted opportunities for US-Chinese academic exchanges that would allow the United States to better understand Chinas goals and doctrine (Zhao 2021).\n\nWhat seems clear, however, is that it would be almost impossible to include China in an immediate follow-on treaty to New START. First, the remaining time until February 2026 is not enough to include an entirely new negotiating partner with whom no such negotiating history or relations exist. Notably, it took the United States and Russia decades to get to their first verifiable arms control treaty. Second, Chinese officials have explicitly and repeatedly rejected joining arms limitation talks and previously suggested that they will join such negotiations only after the \"huge gap\" between their arsenal and the US and Russian nuclear arsenals has been closed. Until then, however, they have signaled that they stand ready to discuss \"all issues related to strategic stability and nuclear risk reduction in the framework of P5, [the UN Security Councils five permanent members, including] China, Russia, US, UK, and France\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peoples Republic of China 2020).\n\nChina likely perceives time to be on its side and is probably waiting until it gains the needed leverage to become a more equal negotiating partner in this area. The projected increase in the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenalperhaps with up to 1,000 warheads by 2030 (US Department of Defense 2021, 90) and potentially as many ICBMs as each of the United States and Russiacould potentially create new opportunities for arms control discussions around the end of this decade. But, even then, China is unlikely to agree to strategic arms control limits until it feels confident enough in its nuclear forces continued survivability. Moreover, China has traditionally relied on secrecy and opacity to help safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal (Riqiang 2016). It would have to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime like the New START treaty.\n\nMeanwhile, to make any progress, the United States should continue to explore the following questions: What are the lessons from previous nuclear dialogues with China that may form the basis for future joint efforts? A previous track 1.5 dialogue (a term of art to describe situations in which both official and non-official actors cooperate) with China clarified that China, seeking recognition for its prominent role in the new international order, is interested in discussing a \"new paradigm of strategic stabilityone not built around deterrent threats, especially nuclear blackmailbut broader ideals of cooperation and mutual respect \" (Santoro and Gromoll 2020, 11). The United States needs to therefore think about possible ways to make China feel this interest is being addressed while preserving its national security priorities.\n\nMoreover, Chinas strategic stability concerns all center around the fear that the United States might be after \"absolute security,\" looking to overcome mutual vulnerability. Therefore, the current and future US administrations should consider tools to build confidence in this area with China. Even if informal and on a track 1.5 basis, these could eventually lay the groundwork for a first treaty with China.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for cooperation with China, the United States should also explore the following questions: Is there any room for the United States and China to slowly start exchanging certain types of information about each others strategic nuclear forces, in particular those types about which China might not feel as protective? What would the United States be prepared to offer China in exchange for limits on Chinese nuclear forces? Is a more creative French-style approach to negotiations neededthat offers to combine unrelated issues, which in Chinas case would include tariffs, special economic zones, and other economic issues? How can the United States best leverage the P5 forum for risk reduction with China?\n\nMake long-term investments\n\nBecause of the difficulty of achieving the United States current objectives, especially the inclusion of China, in a follow-on treaty, it is advisable to develop and pursue a long-term strategy for achieving these goals. Given the current geopolitical context, a treaty covering Chinese strategic nuclear forces might not happen until the 2030s when China feels secure enough in its nuclear deterrent capability and negotiation leverage.\n\nTo be ready once the other side agrees to talk, the United States should start making the following long-term investments. First, it should develop its positions on priority demands and possible concessions it would be willing to make in negotiations with both Russia and China. Second, it should explore all possibilities for the national laboratories to engage in technical verification exchanges and preparations with both Russia and China to ensure technical details will be ready once circumstances are ripe for new treaties and agreements. Additionally, to increase cooperation with China that may lead to more cooperation in the area, the United States may consider offering early warning training to China which is intensively developing its early warning capability. Something similar was considered for Russia during the Cold War and would have the added benefit of reducing miscalculation risks. Finally, the United States should view even unfruitful negotiations as a means to build and maintain arms control negotiation expertiseas well as to uphold communication channelsuntil a treaty can be successfully negotiated and concluded.\n\nGet the militarys support\n\nHaving the militarys support is key to both negotiations and ratification. First, the US Department of Defense is one of the most important US interagency stakeholders, and the interagencys support has proven crucial during negotiations. During the New START negotiations, Gottemoeller assesses the strong Pentagon support to be one of the core factors in the negotiations success (Gottemoeller 2021, 96). Getting the two top military leaders together helped overcome institutional resistance in each military bureaucracy (Gottemoeller 2021, 70). US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen and Russian Gen. Makarov, by simply agreeing on the main issues and their priority, gave the Russian delegations military members a high-level boost within the Russian Ministry of Defense for working the details (Gottemoeller 2021, 74).\n\nSecond, the militarys support increases the chances of ratification. Many senators simply do not wish to be on the record for voting against the military.\n\nThe militarys support is best achieved primarily by listening to and addressing its concerns. In the New START negotiations, for instance, the US military services were worried about the costs of elimination procedures and the operational interruptions due to inspections (Gottemoeller 2021, 63). The negotiators focus and dedication toward this issue helped ensure their support. Moreover, involving the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as much as possible throughout the negotiations can be key in this effort too as it will make the military feel like it partially owned the process.\n\nFuture arms control will have to solve several problems for the US military. First, old problems that are likely to resurface without a follow-on to the New START Treaty should not be discounted. These concern primarily the lack of constraints on Russian nuclear forces which would incentivize a new arms race and the costs of the additionally-needed intelligence collection and analysis in the absence of a verification mechanism. In fact, after the New START Treatys executive extension in 2021, US Gen Hyten, who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to 2021, expressed his and other Department of Defense officials support of the treaty especially because of its nuclear weapons limits and verification process (Vergun 2021).\n\nAdditionally, the amount of military backing is likely to increase with the number of new problems the negotiations manage to address. Gen. Hyten is one of many Department of Defense officials to reiterate that new Russian weapons and Chinas buildup are increasingly posing strategic problems for the US military (Vergun 2021). Addressing these issues in some form or another through future arms control approaches would likely help this US administration, or the next, get the necessary military support. Moreover, maintaining deterrence through a strong nuclear triad has historically been a strong military interestalthough there is reasonable debate on what is needed in this regard. Overall, it is advisable to frame any future arms control approaches within a framework that seeksand getsthe militarys support.\n\nGain bipartisan support\n\nTo be sustainable, a follow-on agreement would need broad bipartisan support to remain insulated from politicization. This is particularly critical given the likelihood of political fluctuation in the House, Senate, and presidency over the coming years. New STARTs survival throughout the Trump administrations pattern of treaty withdrawals can be partially attributed to continued bipartisan support within Congressincluding from senators who initially voted in favor of the treaty in 2010 and remained in Congress throughout that tumultuous period.\n\nTo that end, a follow-on agreement must address the concerns of both major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans. Chief among these are concerns over breakout potential and verification.\n\nOne prominent critique of New START is that it could incentivize warhead uploading in a crisis because both parties are permitted to retain an unlimited number of non-deployed strategic warheads (Smith 2020). As discussed earlier, both countries do indeed have a significant upload capacity and could more than double their number of deployed warheads if necessary. However, a potential breakout scenario is likely to be more of a Russian concern than a US one: given that the United States has a larger number of empty launch spots on its missiles than Russia does, the United States has a significantly larger upload capacity. As a result, a potential breakout capacity should be more of a fear for Russia than for the United States, making the prospect of a Russian breakout unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, even though a significant upload would accelerate the arms race, it may not necessarily affect strategic stability between the United States and Russia. In 2012, a joint report by the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to Congress noted that: \"The Russian Federation . . . would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty, primarily because of the inherent survivability of the planned US strategic force structure, particularly the OHIO-class ballistic missile submarines, a number of which are at sea at any given time\" (US Department of Defense 2012). This argument could potentially be used in the future to mitigate fears among US policy makers of a future breakout scenario.\n\nAnother critique of New START centers around the treatys verification regimespecifically, that a limited number of on-site inspections may not be enough to verify compliance with the treatys central limits on deployed warheads. As explained by Bryan Smith, a senior fellow at the George Mason Universitys National Security Institute:\n\n\"[E]ven if a US inspection revealed that a particular missile was loaded with a number larger than Russia had declared, there is no logical way to infer from thisor any such discrepancythat the entire force had exceeded the 1,550 warhead limit. Conversely, neither could we logically conclude that the entire force complied with the 1,550 limit, even if the 20-30 percent lifetime sample inspections all confirmed that the observed warhead loadings matched their declarations.\" (Smith 2020)\n\nGiven Russias pattern of violating arms control agreements, such concerns should be taken seriously. Yet, perfect verificationthat is, accurate and exhaustiveis not necessary for the success of an agreement. Rather, the United States should be satisfied with ensuring Paul Nitzes definition of effective verification that \"if the other side moves beyond the limits of the treaty in any militarily significant way, we would be able to detect such violations in time to respond effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of the violation\" (Nitze 1988).\n\nIt is therefore possible for the United States to achieve effective verification of a treaty through limited on-site inspections. Ivan Oelrich, a former vice president of the Federation of American Scientists, comprehensively addressed the prospect of Russian cheating in 2010:\n\n\"Say the Russians wanted to cheat by putting more warheads than allowed on, say, 10% of their missiles. [. . .] They would have to put the warheads on missiles and then lie on the data exchange and hope they dont get caught. So, if we pick our inspection sites randomly, then there is a 10% chance they will get caught in one inspection and a 90% chance they will get away without detection on that one inspection. But there is only an 81% chance of getting past two inspections, 73% chance away with three, and so on. If we do 10 inspections, there is a 2/3 chance we will catch a violation of only a 10% cheat, hardly odds that would appeal to a prospective cheater. There is a 90% chance we would catch a 20% cheat. Just in the first 10 inspections. Remember that inspections continue over the years and our confidence will increase over time, approaching near certainty that even small violations will be detected by the time the warhead limits are reached\" (Oelrich 2010).\n\nAs a result, to alleviate these broader political concerns over verification, the United States should aim to incorporate a sufficient number of on-site inspections into any follow-on agreement. A rough calculation to determine an acceptable number of inspections can be derived, as done above, by estimating the percentage of missiles where Russia will try to cheat and selecting a confidence percentage of acceptable risk. The formula is expressed as follows: 1-x = yz, where x is the desired confidence percentage, y is the likelihood of not catch- ing a cheating Russia during each independent inspection, and z is the number of necessary inspections.\n\nFor example, if the United States suspects that Russia could try to cheat with 10 percent of its missiles, then it will need at least 21 inspections to achieve a 90 percent confidence rating that Russia is not cheating at that rate. It would need at least 28 inspections to achieve a 95 percent confidence rating, and at least 229 inspections to achieve a 99 percent confidence rating. The desired confidence rating, coupled with an educated assessment of Russias capability and intent to cheat, will help determine how many on-site inspections would be sufficient to verify an agreement. However, these will need to again be carefully weighed with the militarys operational costs and sensitivity concerns. Due to the US Senates concerns about Russian cheating and the return to great power competition since New STARTs negotiations, the right balance might end up requiring a higher confidence rating today.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon put in proportional efforts to overcome the political forces stalling meaningful dialogue, February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals.\n\nRussia and the United States would lose mutual predictability, and military planners would have to consider an increased worst-case scenario, starting with the possible upload of nearly doubleor possibly more, in the case of the United Statesthe total number of warheads on strategic delivery vehicles. Both sides would inevitably accelerate defense spending, resulting in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nTo preserve bilateral arms control in these times of strategic competition, the United States and Russia should consider and prepare for several options, with trade-offs between feasibility and ambition: continued adherence through mutual moratoria the negotiation of a new executive agreement, and the conclusion of an entirely new treaty. The first two options have the benefit of not requiring legislative approval. However, their value would depend on the amount of political will on both sides to legally enable continued verification and refrain from cheating or exiting the agreement. At the same time, the United States and Russia need to carefully examine and prioritize their underlying interests for the option of a follow-on treaty. Even if a follow-on treaty fails to be ready by February 2026, strategic arms control treaty history has demonstrated that there are reasonable options for bridging treaty-less periods.\n\nThe history of treaty negotiations informs the next steps for the US government: (1) re-evaluate the full box of arms control tools in the light of strategic competition, (2) make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise, (3) understand Russian and Chinese strategic priorities, (4) ensure readiness to negotiate once Russia and eventually China agree to talk, (5) get the militarys support, (6) ensure presidential leadership, and (7) gain bipartisan support. The best practices for each of these steps should help guide the next generation of arms control champions and ensure that the United States, Russia, and China can temper the most dangerous impulses of geopolitical competition and pursue their mutual security priorities through strategic arms control.\n\n(Editors note: The text on pages 354 and 355 of the PDF version of this articlestarting from one paragraph above the subheading \"Plan B: pursuing and executive agreement\" and ending at the subheading \"Plan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\"has been corrected for issues of fact.)",

                "cc_text": "As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly today recommended Member States create an international register of damage to serve as a record of evidence and claims information.\n\nBy the terms of the text, titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" adopted by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions the Assembly recognized that the Russian Federation must be held to account for any violations of international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law in or against Ukraine. The Assembly further recognized the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury arising from the Russian Federations internationally wrongful acts.\n\nThe Assembly also reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine and demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from that countrys territory.\n\nMany delegates expressed their support for the establishment of a registry while others voiced their concern over the resolutions divisiveness and dangerous precedent in allowing the establishment of a mechanism that is not accountable to the Assembly. Several delegations spotlighted the hypocrisy and double standards of the resolutions sponsors.\n\nIntroducing the text (document A/ES-11/L.6), the representative of Ukraine noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he underscored while emphasizing that the resolution is concerned with ensuring an appropriate response that averts any aggressors temptation to start a war. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nAs an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery, the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the Assemblys authority, Guatemalas minister noted.\n\nIt is very straightforward, Albanias speaker explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability.\n\n\"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars,\" Polands speaker stressed.\n\n\"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" the Russian Federations delegate countered, noting that the United Nations would have no role in the establishment of a mechanism created by a group of States which will decide its functioning. The West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery intended to draw out the conflict. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations.\n\nElaborating on the texts flaws, the speaker for China noted that the invoked articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts have no legally binding status as the research products of the International Law Commission. The Assembly is not a judicial body, he stressed, while his colleague from Eritrea agreed on behalf of a group of like-minded countries. Its resolutions cannot go beyond its mandate and responsibilities to serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts, she emphasized. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she added.\n\nWill Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory?, that countrys speaker asked. What about Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine? he continued. Creating a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and well-documented demands is unjust, morally unacceptable and damaging to the Assemblys credibility, he emphasized.\n\nEchoing the concern over the \"message of exceptionalism\", the representative for South Africa pointed out the lack of clarity on the mechanisms composition and eventual legal status.\n\nAlso speaking today were the representatives of Latvia (on behalf of Nordic-Baltic countries), Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Australia, Canada, Slovakia, Italy, Ireland, Syria, Nicaragua, Romania, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, France, Netherlands, Belarus, Iran, the United States and the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nAn observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also spoke.\n\nThe representatives of the Bahamas (on behalf of the Caribbean Community), Mexico, Venezuela, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Pakistan, Kenya, Brunei Darussalam, Argentina, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Bahrain spoke in explanation of vote.\n\nThe Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 15 November, to consider the election of members to the Committee for Programme and Coordination and appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences, the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the Joint Inspection Unit. The Assembly will also take up the related reports of those bodies and the reports of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).\n\nIntroduction of Draft Resolution\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), introducing the draft resolution titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" (document A/ES-11/L.6), noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Today, the Russian Federation is doing everything it can to avoid paying the price for its own war and occupation, he said, before referencing that countrys words and stance on the creation of the United Nations Compensation Commission for any damage, loss or injury arising out of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait. From day one of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has thrown bombs, missiles and shells at Ukrainian cities and villages; destroyed roads, bridges and railways; demolished almost half of Ukraines power grid and utilities; and committed murder, rape, torture, forced deportation and looting. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he said, while urging the Assembly to hold that country accountable. The Russian Federation prefers impunity to accountability and knows only two things lies and veto when it comes to the Security Councils processes, he said.\n\nThe proposed resolution, he noted, calls for Member States to build the legitimate international infrastructure which addresses the consequences of the Russian Federations aggression against his country, records evidence of atrocities and preserves the hope for justice for millions whose lives have been forever changed. It is about an appropriate response which averts the temptation of any aggressor in starting a war, he emphasized. He then reaffirmed his countrys commitment to a transparent, impartial and objective process managed and overseen by the international community and expressed his hope for cooperation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in assessing damages. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nMARIO ADOLFO BCARO FLORES, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala , said that, as a country that in its own history has experienced a lot of conflict, Guatemala acknowledges the importance of peace and respect for human rights. The draft resolution is a step towards reconciliation among the parties. Considering that the text includes civilian claims, it is an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery. As a country that strongly believes in multilateralism, Guatemala is convinced that the Assembly has the mandate and authority to adopt the draft, as set out in Chapter Four of the United Nations Charter. The language of the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the authority of the General Assembly. He called on all Member States to support the initiative, because \"it is the right thing to do\". The Assembly cannot remain paralyzed or inactive.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), offering to correct gaffes in Ukraines statement, called the draft resolution a classic example of a rules-based order in which a narrow group of States attempts to consecrate something that is illegal while also positioning the Assembly as a judicial body, which it is not. \"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" he said, emphasizing that the draft resolution tries to legalize something which, from the point of view of international law, cannot be legalized. Moreover, if adopted, the text will have consequences for the co-sponsors which, like a boomerang, will go back on them. The \"so-called international mechanism\" would be created by a group of States that will decide its functioning and designate the guilty parties and the amount of reparations. The United Nations will play no role in that process, there will be no accountability to the Assembly and most Member States will have no right to any control over the mechanism, he added.\n\nThe Russian Federation has no doubt that the funds for damage compensation will be drawn from frozen, or rather stolen, Russian assets worth billions of dollars, he said, adding that the West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery that is intended to draw out the conflict. This will increase global tensions and instability, but the beneficiaries will be Western military corporations that have already made billions of dollars from the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Neither the Assembly nor any other mechanism can annul sovereignty immunity, which States assets have under international law, he emphasized. Those delegations which support the draft resolution will be implicated in the illegal expropriation of sovereignty assets. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations, as the draft resolution is being put forward by States with a rich record of looting the rest of the world through colonialism, slavery and the exploitation of natural resources. The countries of the West never considered reparations as a way of atoning for their own sins, he said, adding that if adopted, the draft resolution will have systemic consequences for the Organization.\n\nOLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, recalled how, on 2 March, the General Assembly with an overwhelming majority confirmed that the Russian Federation committed an aggression against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. \"Damage inflicted on Ukraine is huge,\" he said. Under international law, the responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful act. The draft resolution recommends the creation by Member States and Ukraine of a register of damage. That register will serve as a repository of evidence of all types of damage.\n\nThe resolution also recognizes the need for the establishment of an international claims mechanism for reparation for damage as a second step, he continued. Rather than charging the domestic legal system of Ukraine and other States with a potentially very high number of individual litigations, a centralized and specialized system would be more appropriate. \"Russia must be held to account for its wrongful acts and wanton destruction,\" he stressed. Every country enjoys the right to document crimes committed against its population, territory or cultural property in order to secure a proper investigation.\n\nSOPHIA TESFAMARIAM ( Eritrea ), speaking on behalf of a Group of Like-Minded Countries, stressed that the Assembly is not a judicial body. Its resolutions represent the political will of States and can in no way serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts as such an action would go beyond its mandate and responsibilities, she said. As such, the draft resolution does not have sufficient legal basis, is not in line with the established practice and would only promote a divisive agenda within the Assembly. The texts adoption, she warned, would set a dangerous precedent that would allow for the Assemblys \"blessing\" to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed nor accountable to the organ responsible for creating it. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she noted.\n\nAs national positions must be respected, the Assembly must play a positive role in ensuring the conflict in Ukraine is resolved through diplomatic efforts and means while avoiding any initiative that might further aggravate the situation on the ground and escalate tensions, she emphasized. Sovereign States must not be forced to take specific sides in the conflict. Any attempt to entrench a cold warera mentality and block politics based on confrontation, deepening divisions and the imposition of disparate visions and agendas must be rejected by all, she urged.\n\nANDREJS PILDEGOVIS ( Latvia ), speaking on behalf of the eight NordicBaltic countries, recalled that the Russian Federations brutal invasion has created Europes largest humanitarian tragedy since World War II. More than 17 million people have been displaced, while three million must get by without water, electricity, sanitation and heating. Russian armed forces have deliberately attacked critical infrastructure, including energy grids, power interconnectors and water stations. Collecting and preserving evidence is important because the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its internationally wrongful acts against Ukraine and its people, he emphasized.\n\nHe quoted the President of Ukraine as having told journalists a few hours earlier that investigators had uncovered more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson area after it was abandoned by Russian forces. There must be no impunity for these crimes and perpetrators must be held to account. Reiterating the NordicBaltic countries firm support for Ukraine, he urged the Russian Federation to abide by international law and uphold its international commitments. He also called for the SecretaryGeneral and the United Nations to continue efforts to restore respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.\n\nKRZYSZTOF SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) underscored the need for an unambiguous and comprehensive response from the international community. As accountability must remain the priority as the war continues, the Russian Federation must be held responsible for the consequences of all its violations, including reparations for the injury and damage caused by its glaring and largescale violation of its international obligations, he stressed. Poland supports the creation of an international register of damage, he said while calling for all damages to be always and appropriately compensated. \"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars\", he stressed. The proposed register, he continued, will not only assist Ukraine in rebuilding itself but will also bring justice to the victims of the Russian Federations barbaric acts.\n\nMOHAN MAITHRI PIERIS ( Sri Lanka ), noting that the most urgent step is to engage in talks for a ceasefire, stressed that an attempt to provide justification through a General Assembly resolution to seizure sovereign assets of one party would amount to an overreach of the application of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Further pointing out that the Assembly is a political body for deliberation, he underscored that it cannot determine State responsibility or usurp the sovereign immunity of State property under international law. Highlighting that the register initiative creates a dangerous precedent, he emphasized that it may result in compelling the parties to resort to a more lethal and sophisticated method of engaging in the conflict.\n\nABDULAZIZ M. ALWASIL ( Saudi Arabia ), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the Council is very concerned with the crisis in Ukraine and its humanitarian, economic and political consequences. The Council aligns itself with the fundamental principles of respect for international law and the United Nations Charter that govern relations between countries, he said, urging all parties to respect their obligations under international law. The best course is to reach a settlement by diplomatic means that serves the interests of all parties. The draft resolution is based on the main principles and guidelines of redress adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 147/60 in 2005, he noted, adding that any mechanism must be based on procedures and standards that are internally accepted and under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide redress and reparations in a fair manner. He expressed the Councils hope of finding a satisfactory solution and supported all humanitarian initiatives that achieve this purpose and bring peace to the region.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) spotlighted the continued damage and loss to Ukraine and its people caused by the Russian Federations unprovoked and illegal invasion. The scenes of relief and joy as Ukrainian civilians in Kherson greet Ukraines liberating armed forces, she noted, should leave the international community with no doubt about the cruel and destructive nature of the Russian Federations invasion. It will take a broad international effort to support Ukraines recovery and construction in order to build a safe and prosperous future for its people, she continued. Only one country is responsible for the damage to Ukraine, must pay for that damage and must be held to account for actions that are in clear violation of international law, she said before expressing her support for establishing a register of damage as an important first step towards justice.\n\nISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ) recalled that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime and that responsibility for these actions must be held. \"Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force must not occur in any corner of the globe,\" he said, adding that the draft resolution, if adopted, should contribute to reparations for the serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Russian Federation must immediately stop its war of aggression, withdraw all its troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and respect Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he added.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ) said that it is the General Assemblys responsibility \"to do all we can\" to avoid the deadly consequences of war. \"We see accountability and reparation processes as an important element in avoiding and forestalling further perpetuation of grave atrocities,\" she added. New Zealand is strongly committed to supporting international mechanisms that seek accountability for the Russian Federations clear breaches of international law. In addition to mechanisms that seek accountability, New Zealand believes that future reparation processes can play a critical role in the rebuilding of communities, he said. Those that are responsible for causing damage and injury by breaching international law must make full reparations for rebuilding and compensating Ukraine. \"The principles at stake in Ukraine are deeply significant to New Zealand as a small State acting in the world,\" she said, urging the Russian Federation to commit to dialogue and act in the interests of peace.\n\nDANG HOANG GIANG ( Viet Nam ) expressed concern over recent developments in the situation in Ukraine, with few prospects for an early resolution. \"We cannot let cooperation and dialogue take the back seat,\" he emphasized. While noting the importance of resolving the \"war legacies\" for reconstruction, maintenance of peace, stability and prosperity for the livelihoods of the people of Ukraine, he stressed that the immediate task is to respond adequately to the urgent humanitarian needs of those impacted by hostilities in the country. He further pointed out that the international community should refrain from actions that may drive the parties further apart and delay the prospects of a peaceful settlement.\n\nMITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ), emphasizing that \"we will not be fooled by Russias misinformation and obfuscation,\" said the draft resolution does not overstep the Assemblys powers in any way. Rather, it simply recognizes fundamental principles of international law by which all States, including the Russian Federation, must abide. A register of damage and a reparations mechanism, appropriately constructed, will be an important component of a fair, impartial and just framework for determining the reparations that the Russian Federation must make to ensure lasting peace. He urged all Member States to continue to support this and all other efforts to ensure that the Russian Federation ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and to make reparations for the injury and damage it has caused.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) spotlighted the Russian Federations footprint of destruction. While the United Nations and other organizations have reported continuously on the significant and widespread damages caused by the Russian Federations aggression, there is a need to have a detailed map of what has happened to have a full picture of this man-made catastrophe, he emphasized. In expressing his support for the resolution, he called on all Member States to vote in favour as an act of justice and dignity. It is very straightforward, he explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability. The Russian Federation must silence the guns, withdraw completely and unconditionally from Ukraine and engage in negotiations. \"Ukraine is home to Ukrainians. It does not have to become the graveyard of Russian soldiers,\" he said.\n\nROBERT KEITH RAE ( Canada ) said the resolution is not about seizing assets or dealing with State sovereignty; rather, it is about saying there must be a registry for there to be an eventual reckoning for the damage and destruction that has been caused. When one country attacks another country, it is a breach of the law, and it is against the rules. The Russian Federation has prevented the Security Council from functioning and has tried to tie up the General Assembly and the Council in knots because it cannot bring itself to admit that its Special Military Operation is not that at all but rather a systematic attack on Ukraine. The Russian Federation is attempting to freeze and starve the people of Ukraine. \"Of course, we need to find peace,\" he said, but the one and only country that can secure peace refuses to accept responsibility for its own aggression. The Assembly is not being asked to perform the function of judge or jury or to go too far, it is simply saying there should be a registry and Ukraine and other countries should be allowed to support that registry.\n\nMICHAL MLYNR ( Slovakia ), associating himself with the European Union, and recalling the Assemblys demand for the Russian Federation to cease its aggression against Ukraine and to withdraw from its internationally recognized borders, said today is an opportunity to address Moscows second obligation under customary international law. He asked delegates to imagine that their countries neighbour had launched a brutal and illegitimate military aggression that resulted in enormous damage against them. Would they not want the international community to hold the aggressor to account with an obligation to pay reparations, he wondered. \"I believe the answer is clear,\" he said, urging delegates to vote in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nMAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, said that, despite strong condemnations, the Russian Federations violent actions continue to cause suffering and destruction in Ukraine. \"The picture that is emerging after Russias recent withdrawal from Kherson is once again one of destruction and pain inflicted on the local population,\" he said. The draft resolution does not establish any standing United Nations reparation or compensation mechanism. It is instead aimed at providing global legitimacy by recommending to Member States the creation of an international register of damage. Such register will coordinate and organize evidencegathering efforts, including those carried out in the context of various investigations by United Nations bodies. \"Ukraine needs reparations to have the possibility of rebuilding itself after the war housing for its people, schools, hospitals, roads, railways and bridges, as well as its industry and power grid all that was destroyed by Russia during its invasion and occupation,\" he added.\n\nFERGAL MYTHEN ( Ireland ), associating himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation faces legal consequences arising from its continued breaches of international law. Explaining that the draft resolution recognizes and affirms Moscows clear obligation to cease its wrongful acts and to make reparations, he said that an international register of damage would not only preserve evidence of damage, loss and injury but also shed light on atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people. It would be an important first step towards accountability, he said, adding that reparations will alleviate some of the longterm consequences of this horrific war.\n\nBASSAM SABBAGH ( Syria ), aligning himself with the Group of LikeMinded Countries, pointed out that \"Western countries\" are promoting political polarization within the United Nations to deepen the divide among its Member States. He stressed that the organ should avoid any initiative which exacerbates the conflict and prevents its peaceful resolution. Noting that the draft resolution is part of a series of \"unbalanced bias and provocative resolutions\" pushed by the United States and its Western partners, he stated that its real objective is to pay for the increasing purchases of weapons by Ukraine. In this regard he asked the Assembly: \"Who will compensate my country for the destruction of the Syrian infrastructure by the socalled international coalition?\"\n\nJASSER JIMNEZ ( Nicaragua ), echoing the statement of the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the resolution is an example of the hypocrisy and double standards of certain countries. Nicaragua supports a robust multilateralism and a new international order with a deep transformation between countries, he said, calling for an end to double standards and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution shamelessly seeks to politicize the Organization by setting up an international mechanism that is not administered by the body that established it, he said. This is a mechanism for a single case and ignores the painful history that imperialist countries have left behind. It does not recognize the genocide against the original peoples of countries. He supported his brethren in the Caribbean and Africa that are seeking reparations for these losses. Sanctions are direct aggressions against people, and during the pandemic, they have become crimes against humanity, he said, calling for reparations for damage caused by Western countries. He said that in 1986 the International Court of Justice condemned the United States for hostilities against Nicaragua and ordered $17 billion in compensation. It is a decision that the United States has not complied with. Developing countries have been demanding a reparation mechanism for the damage created by climate change. The resolution is a divisive act in the Assembly and does not promote dialogue. It sets a dangerous precedent as it is not administered by the Assembly and his delegation will vote against it.\n\nCORNEL FERU ( Romania ), aligning himself with the European Union, said the resolution is an additional step towards accountability for the Russian Federations blatant violations of international law. Its provisions, he noted, complement existing international efforts concerning individual criminal responsibility by adding the missing dimension of the States responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts. Ukraines case for reparations, he continued, is a moral and legal imperative which constitutes an important deterrent to the benefit of the entire community. If the aggressor is left unsanctioned, this could lead to an irreversible decay of the international order which generations have strived to build in the aftermath of the world wars, he warned. As its provisions do not establish any new entities, the resolution undertakes a modest and principled step by recognizing the need for an international mechanism for reparation and recommending the creation of an international register of damage, he emphasized.\n\nSONG KIM ( Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea ) stressed that the draft resolution is \"nothing more than a politically motivated document\" to shift all responsibilities of the crisis in Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Pointing out that the text is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, he further noted that the Assembly is not a judicial organ and has no mandate to judge the internationally wrongful acts and to provide the legal ground for remedy and reparations. Voicing concern over the possibility of abusing this draft resolution as a basis to illegally seize property and assets of a sovereign State, he opposed the text as a \"product of a unilateral and double standard practice.\"\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) said that the draft resolution contains obvious flaws and loopholes. Elaborating, he said that the Assembly is not an international judicial body, and therefore it cannot define or hold accountable international wrongful acts. Moreover, the draft resolution aims to invoke articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, but these articles are only the research products of the International Law Commission, an expert body, and they are not legally binding. In addition, creating a register of damage outside the framework of the United Nations is a diversion from past practice that makes no sense and has no precedent. Such draft resolutions should be subjected to full consultations with a view to achieving a consensus that can stand the test of history. Regrettably, the co-sponsors of this text did not organize consultations in earnest, pushing instead for the Assembly to take unconstructive, hasty action. Declaring that China will vote against the draft resolution, he called on the parties to the crisis to return to dialogue and negotiation, with the Assembly working actively towards that end instead of aggravating divisions.\n\nNATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ), associating herself with the European Union, reiterated her countrys commitment to Ukraine and its people in ensuring justice for all victims of the Russian Federations illegal war. Victims must be respected in terms of their dignity and rights, she emphasized while spotlighting her countrys support for Ukraine legal actions and to the international efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. As the Russian Federation must be held responsible for its crimes, its flagrant violations of international law and the legal consequences of its wrongful actions, she called on the Assembly to support the draft resolution.\n\nMATHU JOYINI ( South Africa ) said that the impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt all over the world. South Africa reiterates that the territorial integrity of all States, including that of Ukraine, must be respected and rejects all actions that undermine principles laid out in the United Nations Charter. The Security Council should play a constructive role in resolving this conflict, she added, expressing regret that the Council continues to fail the people of Ukraine. The General Assembly, for its part, should create conditions conducive to dialogue, mediation and diplomacy. That, after all, is the only path to peace. The United Nations should do more to devote equal time to the resolution of all conflict situations that threaten international peace and security. She expressed concern that the General Assembly was \"sending a message of exceptionalism\" and that reparations matter in some situations but not others. Member States must refrain from double standards. The draft resolution places the United Nations in uncharted waters. The General Assembly is being asked to grant its authority to the setting up of a reparations mechanism, but there is no clarity on what the mechanism will look like or what its eventual legal status will be. \"We are uncomfortable\" with the draft text, she said, noting that South Africa will abstain from todays vote.\n\nYOKA BRANDT ( Netherlands ), aligning herself with the European Union, stressed that the evidence of damages caused by the Russian Federation might disappear or get lost under the fog of war, therefore pointing to the need for a registry as outlined in the draft resolution. The text establishes that the aggressor is liable for the damages, she added, which must be documented in a register to allow for compensations. Recalling that the Assembly has established a register for damages in the past, she underscored that it is within its competence to recommend establishing one for this case. She called on Member States to \"vote for justice for all those who have suffered damages in the unprovoked conflict\".\n\nVALENTIN RYBAKOV ( Belarus ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the draft resolution introduced today once again shows that Western States have given up on principles of multilateralism and cooperation with the United Nations. Through the Minsk agreements, his delegation did all it could to organize negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Yet the Western States, the guarantors, did not really want to have the situation resolved, he said. Instead, they endorsed the fomenting escalation in the Donbas region in 2014, supported Ukraine and pumped weapons into it, creating the pre-conditions for todays situation, in which both countries have become an existential threat to each other. The draft does not stand up to the cross-scrutiny of international law. It does not mention the crimes of imperialists and the consequences of slavery, he said, pointing out that no one has paid reparations for these types of damages, which are not even possible to assess. The draft does not mention the economic terrorism of sanctions that suffocate whole peoples. The war in Ukraine is one of 30 armed conflicts in the world. The Assembly should not make an exemption for one country, he stressed. The text will not bring the situation one step closer to peace; it will just polarize the Assembly. As such, his delegation will vote against it, he said.\n\nPEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA ( Cuba ), calling on all parties to protect civilians, their property and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, rejected the double standards, partiality, discriminatory selectivity and opportunistic approaches before the Assembly. Spotlighting the hypocrisy of its main promoters, he urged States to listen and address the compensation claims of Caribbean Community (CARICOM), developing countries and small island developing States among others. The Assembly, he noted, has never established a reparations mechanism for Member States suffering from unilateral coercive measures. Will Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory, he asked before turning his attention to Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine. To limit and accelerate the creation of a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and welldocumented demands is unjust and morally unacceptable, he said. It also severely damages the Assemblys credibility, he added.\n\nAMIR SAEID JALIL IRAVANI ( Iran ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, noted that the draft resolution contains language outside of the Assemblys purview. If agreed upon, the proposed mechanism would have no actual contribution to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and would only serve as a political tool, he cautioned. The main sponsors of the draft resolution, he explained, apply different criteria in other conflicts in a blatant double standard. If an international mechanism is to be established, then it must have a broad mandate that could address any international wrongdoing, including military aggressions, looting, blockades, unilateral sanctions, occupation and the provision of weapons of mass destruction, he contended. Objecting to any mechanism which undermines international law, he pointed out that any acts or decisions of the mechanism in operative paragraphs 3 or 4 would have no legal status and thus be null and void.\n\nRICHARD M. MILLS, JR. ( United States ) said that it is clear what the issue is before the Assembly, namely that the international community must hold the Russian Federation to account for its violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the ensuing damage and abuses. \"This resolution represents a critical step towards accountability,\" he said, describing as tremendous the mounting cost of the Russian Federations unprovoked and unlawful invasion of its neighbour and fellow United Nations member. Pointing to Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter, he said that it is well within the Assemblys authority to adopt the draft resolution and create a damages register that will be an important first step towards a claims adjudication mechanism. This is a matter of justice, not geopolitical competition, and by adopting the text, the Assembly will send a strong message to would-be aggressors worldwide that violations of international law, including the Charter, will have consequences. A vote in favour of the draft resolution is a vote for accountability and for the defence of the Charter, he said, emphasizing that Member States cannot sit on the sidelines when fundamental principles of international law are at stake.\n\nSILVA LEANDER, representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , in its capacity as observer, pointed out that Ukraine will require assistance for further strengthening its democratic institutions, which will be essential for successfully countering corruption and achieving its reconstruction. Noting that the Russian Federation has targeted not only strategic military infrastructure but also civilian targets, public services, supply networks and sectors, she stressed the need to include political and civil society institutions and actors at the local level in Ukraine as \"critical infrastructure\". Emphasizing that the coming process of reconstitution and recovery needs to place democracy at its centre, she deemed it vital to allocate resources to support the reconstruction and improvement of the countrys democratic institutions.\n\nAction\n\nThe representative of Bahamas , speaking on behalf of CARICOM in explanation of vote before the vote, said CARICOM subscribes to the principle that for every wrong, there is a remedy. This is a fundamental principle of law and equity and an equally fundamental principle of international law. Ukraine has experienced injury and the burden of compensation should be imposed on the perpetrator. CARICOM recognizes that the United Nations is vital to resolving international matters. While supporting Ukraines legitimate claims for reparations, he said such a process must be pursued through an appropriate mechanism. The proposal in the resolution contemplates that the Assembly should endorse a process over which it would have no control, oversight or any role. As drafted, the resolution asks Member States to give approval and then trust the process will be continued fairly and objectively.\n\nReferring to language in operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, he said CARICOM will abstain from a vote. Yet the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all its wrongful acts for any violations of international law and/or for any violations of international humanitarian law in or against Ukraine. He reiterated his strong support for the principle that Member States have a legitimate right to claim reparations and compensation for injury, loss and damage caused by the wrongful actions of other Member States. This principle is to be applied in the present case as well as other similar cases worldwide. CARICOM has made this broader point regarding several issues before the international community, including climate action and reparations in connection with the transatlantic slave trade and native genocide. \"There will always exist a moral and/or legal obligation to correct injustice including the legacy of past injustice,\" he said.\n\nThe representative of Mexico , reiterating his countrys defence of Ukraines sovereignty, national unity, independence and territorial integrity, noted the ongoing judicial processes which could lead to the establishment of reparation mechanisms. The reparations stage is still far away, he pointed out, since the conflict is ongoing and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, he said he will vote in favour of the resolution since the resolution limits itself to recommending the creation of a register of damages.\n\nJOAQUN PREZ ( Venezuela ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, rejected attempts to impose a draft resolution that does not receive any consultations or take into account the views of all States involved. Such a methodology will not bring the international community closer to its goal of achieving peace. Rather, it will bring the Assembly closer to a point of no return. The draft resolution represents double standards and is not a peaceful solution. It attempts to use the Assembly to confiscate the properties and assets of other States and advances dubious aims. He said his country knows first-hand the looting of its sovereign resources. The text does not include measures for accountability, and there are no details on how it would be implemented. It does not follow a rules-based order. The proponents of the draft are shamelessly ignoring the crimes committed by colonial powers. The same members taking the lead on the resolution ignore the developing worlds demand for reparations. \"It is moral amnesia,\" he said. He appealed to other delegations to vote against the text, which would create a serious precedent for the Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions.\n\nThe representative of Egypt , in explanation of vote after the vote, noted that he abstained from the vote since the proposal sets a dangerous precedent in asking for the development of a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the United Nations without clarifying the mechanisms rules, working methods or subsequent measures. The role of the Organization and the Assembly has unprecedentedly not been specified, he added. He then turned his attention to the divergent views on the International Law Commissions draft articles. This topic should not have been considered before the achievement of consensus in the Sixth Committee(Legal), he emphasized. In noting the double standard approach of certain States, he expressed his preference for the Assembly to abstain. The Assembly, he cautioned, must undertake a coherent approach going forward on its practices, ability and willingness to create similar reparation mechanisms for other countries.\n\nThe representative of Brazil said he abstained since the resolution does not foster constructive dialogue nor recognize the central role of the United Nations in the process. The text brings a high level of uncertainty regarding the legal parameters of such a register to be created outside the framework of the United Nations and without its supervision, he noted. In recommending the creation of such a mechanism without a specified scope, the Assembly is encouraging the fragmentation of its collective responsibility in promoting peace. It undermines the United Nations and ignores the efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, he emphasized before voicing his regret over the insufficient time for discussion. The emergency special session must be capable of acting in a more transparent and democratic fashion, he urged while referencing the deadlock in the Security Council.\n\nThe representative of Chile said her countrys vote in favour of the resolution is representative of its respect for human rights. She also expressed concern that some delegations in the Sixth Committee (Legal) have been unwilling to negotiate a convention on a binding framework to provide legal certainty regarding the international responsibility of States. Chile calls on those delegations to modify their position. Chile also recognizes that Assembly resolutions have a non-binding character. Further, she said she hopes a reparations fund will be established for relatives of victims of femicide and other violent deaths of women. Chile calls on all parties to continue negotiations and find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia called the resolution \"divisive\", while also recognizing the efforts of the facilitators to provide room for some consultation. The underlying message of the resolution should have been that war must stop and that sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. On the recommendation to establish a registry of damage and a reparations mechanism, he highlighted that such mechanisms must be built upon a foundation of due process. \"The General Assembly resolution at this stage may lead us to a slippery slope,\" he warned. For these reasons, Indonesia abstained from the resolution.\n\nThe representative of India , emphasizing the conflicts impact on the Global South, said delegations need to consider whether a reparation process, initiated through the Assembly, will contribute to resolving the conflict. Such a mechanism must not be established without adequate legal vetting, she said, adding that Member States must avoid steps that might preclude or endanger the possibility of dialogue and negotiations which could bring the conflict to an end. For that reason, India decided to abstain, she said.\n\nThe representative of Singapore said his delegation supported the resolution on the understanding that it is without prejudice to, nor does it seek to undermine or prejudge, the outcomes of ongoing judicial and investigative processes related to the war in Ukraine. Moreover, in Singapores view, the approach contained in the resolution is not automatically applicable to other conflicts, as every situation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law into account, he added.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan , noting that while his country supports the establishment of a claims commission, stressed that any such mechanism must be based on sound legal foundations. Double standards in the application of international law are counterproductive, he emphasized, underscoring that it would be unprecedented to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed by nor accountable to any of the United Nations principal organs, including the Assembly. Irrespective of the origin of the conflict, he added, the highest priority at this moment is immediate cessation of hostilities and dialogue for peace.\n\nThe representative of Kenya stated that, while Ukraine has a sovereign right to make claims for damages and losses caused by the current conflict, so do all peoples and countries that have sought reparations for colonial violence, slavery and other acts of aggression. Noting that this text will pave the way for more concrete discussions, decisions and resolutions on reparation, he emphasized that all Member States should be ready to hear other countries calls for accountability for historical injustices.\n\nThe representative of Brunei Darussalam condemned violations of the sovereignty or territorial integrity of any country and firmly upheld the principles for the respect of international law. Regarding the establishment of a register of damage, she said similar mechanisms have been established under the ambit of the United Nations. Any such independent mechanism should be established according to due process and consultations. She reiterated the importance of diplomacy and called on all parties directly involved to deescalate and resolve the situation by peaceful means, stressing the need to refrain from force and maintain international peace and stability.\n\nThe representative of Argentina said her delegations clear and consistent position has been to defend territorial integrity as a fundamental principle of international law. Any damages must be subject to reparations under international law. She supported the draft resolution as it would achieve accountability for wrongful acts that violate the Charter. She stressed the importance of indicating the damages for such wrongful acts and discussing appropriate means for accountability, bearing in mind that accountability for unlawful acts must apply to all acts that need reparations, without prejudice. For this reason, her delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nThe representative of Qatar , in calling on parties to show restraint and stop the war, said he voted in favour of the resolution since it is in line with his countrys position on the protection of civilians and the provision of reparations for material and psychological damages. Reparations and the mechanisms to implement them, however, must be conducted in accordance with the principles of international law and established international precedents, he stressed.\n\nThe representative of the United Arab Emirates , associating himself with the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he abstained due to the texts unclear and imprecise nature. The resolution offers the Assemblys support for reparations and evidentiary processes that have yet to be defined by a group of Member States still to be determined, he pointed out while expressing his concern over the resolutions implications for sovereign equality and sovereign immunity.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria called on all parties to the conflict to end hostilities and begin negotiations. Nigeria is committed to the principles of the United Nations and calls on all countries to refrain from actions that will worsen the conflict. Current efforts should focus on resuming peace. Nigeria is open to working with all countries on these goals, he said, adding that for such reasons Nigeria abstained from the vote.\n\nThe representative of Sierra Leone reiterated grave concern about the conflict in Ukraine, which has had widespread repercussions all over the world. Sierra Leone is committed to the United Nations Charter and its principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, he said. Noting that his delegations prior votes on the issue of Ukraine have been based on the Charter principles, he said today Sierra Leone abstained from the resolution and was guided by its belief in the Charter and the consistent application of international law. The General Assembly is not an adjudicative body and cannot set out legal consequences; it must recognize all victims of historical injustices, including racism, colonialism and slavery. \"Reparations concern both the past and the present,\" he added.",

                "cc_text": "2:04 p.m. EST\n\nMR PRICE: Its a small but mighty crew today. We know who the real stalwarts are, so appreciate you being here. I have to assume everyone who is not here is out fulfilling their civic duty by voting. Lets do a couple things at the top and then turn to your questions.\n\nFirst, Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Geoffrey Pyatt has been asked to coordinate the United States Governments energy support for Ukraine with international partners. This includes leading our engagement in the G7 effort that foreign ministers announced last week. Assistant Secretary Pyatt is uniquely qualified to lead these efforts, having served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2013 to 2016, in addition to heading the departments international energy policy and assistance programs.\n\nWithin the United States Government, the Department of State will work with the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the National Security Council to assess requests from the Government of Ukraine and identify resources or equipment that may be suitable to the task.\n\nThe interagency group will work with international partners through the G7 mechanism to provide needed equipment and assistance to repair, maintain, and fortify the Ukrainian energy sector over this winter.\n\nThe intensity of Russias strikes targeting Ukrainian power has increased dramatically since October 10th. Russia aims to fracture the energy grid and leave millions without power, water, or heat, in an attempt to reduce Ukraines resilience and determination during the cold winter months.\n\nThe Government of Ukraine will need assistance to ensure Ukraine remains resilient and strong despite Russias efforts to cut off heat and light this winter. President Putin has failed on the battlefield, so he is now waging war on Ukraines civilian infrastructure. We must ensure he fails there too.\n\nAnd next and finally, the United States is alarmed by the continued pattern of actions against judges and prosecutors in Guatemala who handle anti-corruption and human rights cases.\n\nUpholding due process for all citizens, including judges, prosecutors, and journalists, is vital for citizens confidence in their justice institutions. Clear and consistent application of the law is essential for good governance.\n\nThe Guatemalan people deserve justice institutions they can trust, and the United States notes continued actions to prosecute current and former justice actors are weakening Guatemalans most Guatemalas most important safeguards against corruption, impunity, and human rights abuses.\n\nWith that, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Great. Thanks, Ned. Happy Tuesday.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry that neither you nor anyone else in this room won Powerball last night. (Laughter.)\n\nMR PRICE: I was just going to say, unless you bought your ticket in Los Angeles, I imagine you are out of luck.\n\nQUESTION: North of Pasadena.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: The gas station.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes, yes.\n\nQUESTION: Just one thing on the Geoff Pyatt thing. Im just curious, you dont think that his experience as also former ambassador to Greece and knowledge of Mediterranean energy is also relevant?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I could have gone on for another five minutes about Assistant Secretary Pyatt, but, yes, he is uniquely qualified, as we said, for a number of reasons.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Okay. I want to start with something that we havent talked about, or at least we didnt talk about it yesterday, and its kind of fallen off the radar just a tiny bit. And I just want to know what the latest is, if anything, there is on Haiti and the effort to get a multinational presence in there?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, Matt, as you know, weve been working when it comes to the challenges the Haitian people are facing for a number of weeks now. You raised one component of that. I hope that in focusing on that component, the other elements of our work are not overlooked. This is the work to hold accountable those who are responsible for some of the conditions the humanitarian emergency that the Haitian people have faced.\n\nThe United States Government has levied sanctions against some of these actors. The UN Security Council issued sanctions against some of these actors. We have been working, as we have for since the start of this administration and over the course of successive administrations, to enhance the capabilities of the Haitian state, Haitian institutions, including the Haitian National Police.\n\nA number of weeks ago, in October now, the United States and Canada delivered much-needed supplies to the Haitian National Police. Even in recent hours, over the past couple days, youve seen those supplies put to good use by Haitian authorities in breaking the blockade that had been effectively instituted against the port, allowing fuel to once again flow to those who need it most. Weve been very pleased to see the progress that Haitian National Police have made, but still the situation needs to improve. It needs to improve for the welfare and the well-being of Haitis people, especially those in Port-au-Prince who have suffered as a result of the malicious activities and efforts on the part of gang leaders and criminal actors.\n\nSo we continue to work with partners from this building, from New York, capitals around the world to discuss the potential for a mission endorsed by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII. We believe that such a mission would be important to be as an enabling element to what the Haitian National Police and Haitian authorities are already doing. These conversations are ongoing. There are a number of countries that have indicated their interest in learning more about such an effort, potentially taking part in such an effort. Secretary Blinken did discuss this with Foreign Minister Joly, Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada. They both the foreign minister and Secretary Blinken spoke to it in the aftermath of their visit last month, but these conversations are very much ongoing.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, two things. One is you seem to suggest that the situation might have improved somewhat so that the so that it might be less a little less urgent than it was before to get to get something passed. And then the second thing is that I was under the impression that Chapter VII was out, a Chapter VII resolution was wouldnt pass muster with one at least one member of the council. The country begins with the letter C and ends with the letter A.\n\nMR PRICE: So weve there are a couple of countries that could apply to. I wont ask you to elaborate. But first remind me of your first question. Sorry.\n\nQUESTION: Well, it just seems you said the blockade at the port had been eased or if not entirely lifted, but at least eased, and so fuel has been getting out. So does that make it a little less urgent to get a mission on the ground?\n\nMR PRICE: There is still there is still urgency. The status quo remains untenable. It remains untenable for the Haitian people. We hope to see continued improvement in the humanitarian situation. The actions of the Haitian National Police may lead to further improvements. But there continue to be longer-term challenges that an enabling force authorized by the UN Security Council would be able to help address.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, so thats still the goal. And then the second thing so Chapter VII resolution?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is an effort that, as you know, directly responds to the call that was put forward by the UN secretary-general, by the secretary general of the OAS. We believe that a UN Security Council resolution authorizing a non-UN multinational force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter would give the force the legal authorization and the imprimatur of the UN Security Council. This is not something that would be the work of any one country; this would be something that we would do in partnership with a number of countries and that ultimately would be done in partnership with Haitian authorities. After all, it was Haitian authorities, it was the UN secretary-general, it was the OAS secretary general that called for this in the first place.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Other questions? Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. Different subject. And this is not a trick question at all. (Laughter.) The OSCE is in town, the observers, and to observe the election here, and every day at this podium you call on different countries over the world to have and hold free and fair elections. So my question to you is, as the State Department spokesperson, is would you consider do you consider that there are free and fair elections in the United States given that there are concerns with how its run, given that a lot of people contest the results, as you know? And are you concerned about the image that it gives of the United States, that it has been giving over the years to fellow countries over the world?\n\nMR PRICE: So a couple things on that. First of all, Im not going to render an assessment on elections in this country. Its just not part of our remit here in the Department of State. But Ill make a couple points.\n\nNumber one, you made an allusion to the OSCE monitors. I think that in itself is important because we believe in transparency. We believe that we need to model the behavior that we hope and expect to see from fellow democracies around the world by regularly inviting OSCE monitors to be present for our elections, whether its a midterm year, whether its a presidential cycle. We demonstrate that we are committed to the principle of transparency. Were committed to walking the walk when it comes to what we call for around the world.\n\nElection officials in this country here will speak to the processes that unfold over the course of the day. Ill leave that to them. I imagine as they always do, the OSCE will render their own report on this.\n\nOne of the strengths of our democracy is the fact that we acknowledge our challenges. We have never attempted to sweep our challenges, any shortcomings we might have, under the rug. And thats because there is something uniquely American in our belief that our democracy is not perfect, never will be perfect. It is very much a work in progress. It is very much something that is that we are striving to continually improve. Its unfinished; it will always remain unfinished.\n\nSo, of course, youve heard Secretary Blinken speak about some of the challenges weve had in our own country. We dont see that as a weakness around the world. In fact, our ability to acknowledge openly and honestly and candidly with countries around the world that we, too, have our challenges and rather than sweep them under the rug, we acknowledge them. The President of the United States on a couple of instances over the past couple of months has given primetime addresses referencing some of those challenges. That is the defining feature of this democracy, is that we are candid where we do have challenges, where we have shortcomings. We work together as a country fellow citizens to improve where we can. And thats something that well continue to do.\n\nQUESTION: Especially when you consider that it was only in the early 50s that included civil rights and things like that. Just a comment.\n\nMR PRICE: Simon.\n\nQUESTION: I wanted to ask about Egypt given the meetings being held there, and the Secretary will be there with the President in the coming days. Theres a lot of attention and particularly a statement from the UN high commissioner for human rights on the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who is on hunger strike and is jailed in Egypt. I wonder if you had any response to that. Is that something that the U.S. delegation is going to raise specifically with the Egyptians? And does that give you pause over the conclusion that the department reached earlier this year that Egypt had made progress on the issue of political detentions?\n\nMR PRICE: So a couple things on this. So broadly, since taking office, this administration, including at the highest levels President Biden, Secretary Blinken we have underscored that the U.S.-Egypt relationship is stronger, it is strengthened when theres tangible progress on human rights. To that end, weve welcomed the releases and pardons of political prisoners over the past few months, and weve been clear that we support further releases of all Egyptian human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, and others who remain detained for peacefully exercising their universal rights: freedom of expression, freedom of association, to name just two.\n\nThat includes pardoning and releasing Alaa Abd el-Fattah, his co-defendants Mohamed El-Baqer and Mohammed \"Oxygen\" Ibrahim, among many others. We have followed, when it comes to Mr. Abd el-Fattah, his case very closely, since even before his conviction last December by an Egyptian emergency court. And weve raised his case and his continued detention repeatedly and at all levels with the Government of Egypt. We, as are so many around the world, are seriously concerned about Mr. Abd el-Fattahs health, especially given the length of his hunger strike and reports that he is now foregoing even water over the past several days.\n\nAs you know, the President and the Secretary will be off to Sharm El-Sheikh for COP27 later this week. President Biden will meet with President Sisi on Friday as the host of the COP. Of course, not going to get into the contents of a meeting that has yet to occur, but President Biden himself has said that when he meets with foreign leaders, human rights is always on the agenda and that, as President, he will never remain silent on the issue. I can tell you that in the senior interactions that individuals in this building have had with their Egyptian counterparts, including when Secretary Blinken was in Cairo last May, in May of 2021 had a lengthy meeting with President Sisi human rights was at was a prominent feature in that discussion as well. That includes the issue broadly, but to some of the issues weve talked about just now, it also includes specific cases.\n\nAnd weve been clear with the Egyptian Government regarding cases where we would like to see improvement, cases where we would like to see individuals released or pardoned, and that includes in the case of Mr. Abd el-Fattah and his co-defendants.\n\nQUESTION: Is going forward, would you tie military aid, some of the military aid specifically to that case? Or, as you say, you keep youre raising this, but this has been raised over a long period and he obviously hasnt been released. So when youre communicating that to the Egyptians, what are you sort of whats the downside for them if they dont take action?\n\nMR PRICE: So there are a number of tools we have when it comes to working on this issue. One is the fact that Congress, of course, has put restrictions on certain aid that we can provide to the Government of Egypt. We need to make representations to our congressional overseers that Egypt is making progress where we collectively think it needs to make progress. The Secretary determined earlier this year that Egypt had made progress in some of those areas. There is no denying that weve seen a number hundreds of Egyptian political prisoners released in recent months. Thats not to say that we do not think that more can and should be done. And in fact, we do think that more must be done, including in the case of Mr. Abd el-Fattah and his co-defendants.\n\nWe are going to continue to do what we believe to be most effective when it comes to seeking progress on these cases. Oftentimes that engagement will be in private diplomatic channels. If we feel that it is most helpful to a particular case to speak of it publicly, we wont hesitate to do that, and well continue to measure the progress so that we can gauge the strength of the bilateral relationship and, as necessary, report back to Congress, which is obviously keenly interested in this as well.\n\nQUESTION: On COP, do you have any thoughts or comment on former Secretary Kerry greeting and shaking hands with President Maduro of Venezuela?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, I think those of you who have seen the video will recognize that Nicols Maduro, he interrupted what was an ongoing meeting at COP27 to engage Special Envoy Kerry, and this was very much an unplanned interaction, just in the same way that other world leaders have been presented with unplanned interactions from Nicols Maduro. He briefly spoke to Special Envoy Kerry during COP27.\n\nThis was not, as I said before, planned or substantive in any way. Maduro has unfortunately, as it pertains to COP, overseen a period of significant environmental degradation the destruction of the Amazon through deforestation, through oil spills, and illegal mining. And we believe its in the interest of the entire region that such activities come to an end. But as far as that conversation goes, it was unplanned; it was non-substantive as well.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So former Secretary Kerry was caught by surprise and he was basically just being polite? Is that is that the\n\nMR PRICE: He was caught by surprise. I understand that Nicols Maduro has done this to a number of world leaders. This was certainly an interaction that was\n\nQUESTION: (Inaudible) sort of jump out?\n\nMR PRICE: planned.\n\nQUESTION: Who else has he done this to?\n\nMR PRICE: I am not going to put a spotlight on his other interactions, but you can check out some of the video thats available on social media.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMR PRICE: Alex.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. A couple questions. But let me start with Azerbaijan-Armenia (inaudible) on this one. Ive seen the readout actually, its open right here in front of me that you put together this morning. Actually, I was surprised by the length I think shortness is the right way to put that of the statement. Your statements about Secretarys phone calls with the ministers contain more words than this is like 60 words long. How do you want us to read the fact that you have close to nothing to say about the results of the meeting?\n\nMR PRICE: So let me say a couple things on this first, Alex, just to make sure were we have the same context. I think its important to note first that following Secretary Blinkens meeting with his two counterparts his Armenian and his Azerbaijani counterpart yesterday the two countries issued a joint statement. That statement, their statement I will point out that it is longer than our readout its available on the Armenian and the Azerbaijani government websites.\n\nNow, we dont try to make too much of joint statements, but a joint statement in the context of these two countries is something to take note of. Its a very positive sign that these two countries could agree to not only issue a joint statement but to agree on the substance behind it.\n\nIn the meeting, the foreign ministers agreed to expediate their negotiations and to organize another meeting in the coming weeks. They expressed their appreciation to Secretary Blinken, to the U.S. side for organizing the discussions yesterday. I should note that Secretary Blinken was involved in the discussions yesterday, but there were opportunities throughout the course of the day for the two sides to meet and to attempt to bridge their differences, in some cases without the United States as an active participant. We remain committed to promoting a peaceful future for the South Caucasus region. We believe that continued direct dialogue is key to resolving issues and to reaching a lasting peace.\n\nI think going back to your original question, our role in this has been one of facilitator. We provided, over the course of the day yesterday, a space Blair House, in this case for the two countries to come together, just as we did in New York a few weeks ago in late September. But this is not an agreement that the United States is attempting to or seeking to or even can impose on the two sides. What we are doing is trying to create a space and an opportunity for the two sides to come together, to identify their differences of which there are many and to attempt to bridge them.\n\nAnd I think there was yesterday was positive in that the two sides met, they surfaced many of their areas of disagreement. At the end of the day, they were able to agree on a joint statement. They were able to agree to continue meeting and engaging in direct dialogue and diplomacy in the weeks that follow. That, to us, is quite important.\n\nBut it is not for us to prescribe what this lasting comprehensive peace between the two countries might look like. We are not presenting them with a document that is ready to sign. We are doing everything we can to help enable the diplomacy that they themselves will need to undertake and this is not unlike our approach to a number of challenges around the world, where weve demonstrated the viability and the effectiveness of this model. The historic agreement that was reached between Israel and Lebanon just a couple of weeks ago the United States played the role of facilitator, played the role of mediator, but of course we werent dictating the terms.\n\nWhats happening in Nairobi right now, what was happening in Pretoria last week with Special Envoy Hammer engaging with the Ethiopian parties, working as an observer to the talks, and helping the talks along where we could. What weve done in Yemen, what weve done with a number of conflicts and challenges around the globe it is not for us to prescribe, to dictate the terms of any peace agreement, of any accord, of any deal not involving the United States. But it is incumbent on the United States to use the leverage and the authority, the good offices that we have, the expertise and experience that we have in this building and throughout this government to try and help these processes along.\n\nWe think yesterday with Armenia and Azerbaijan was an opportunity to do that, and we think the results are quite positive.\n\nQUESTION: In his opening statement, the Secretary was talking about the real steps, the courageous steps. Can you help us put into context what exactly was he talking about?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, the fact that the two parties have continued to engage, that itself is a real step. That is actually a step that we hope in the coming weeks will continue to allow the parties to build on the momentum that they have been able to sustain since the outbreak of hostilities. There have, of course, been setbacks. But we believe that if they continue down the path of dialogue and diplomacy, theyll be able to build on that momentum, theyll be able to build confidence between them, trust between them, and we will do everything we can to support those processes so that theyre able to reach that comprehensive and lasting peace.\n\nQUESTION: And based on what the Secretary heard from his counterparts, is it his hope or belief that the sides are in fact ready to sign the peace contract by the end of the year?\n\nMR PRICE: We will leave that to the parties. This is a decision that they are going to have to make. I think as you read from their joint statement, the ministers used the opportunity yesterday to share views on elements of a possible peace treaty, and they acknowledge that there are a range of issues that needed to be addressed. But they agreed to expedite their negotiations and organize another meeting in the coming weeks. We will do everything we can to see to it that they are able to make progress towards that comprehensive and lasting peace as quickly as possible, ultimately leading to a comprehensive and lasting peace.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. On the Palestinian issue, a couple of quick ones. The Israeli army declared that the Hebron home of a well-known Palestinian activist, Issa Amro, is declared a military post or whatever, because he complained about the settlements. I wonder if you have any comment on that. He also faces possible deportation or imprisonment.\n\nMR PRICE: Said, we continue to make clear with both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority that members of civil society must be in a position to carry out their important work. We urge the full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza, and as weve said many times before, we believe the Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve equal measure of security, of prosperity, of freedom, of dignity. Were deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation in the West Bank. We call on the parties to do everything they can to de-escalate the situation, return to a period of calm. We know this would be in the interests of Palestinians, it would be in the interests of Israelis, it would be in the interests of the region.\n\nAnd Ill just say that Issa Amro is someone many of us know. The Secretary had an opportunity to meet him when we were in the West Bank in May of 2021. Id had an opportunity to meet him before that. The importance of civil society, of human rights defenders thats something that we protect and promote around the world. The West Bank, Gaza, Israel its no different.\n\nQUESTION: So would you call on the Israelis to vacate Mr. Amros home and return it to him, not as a military post?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, Israel of course faces very real and acute security challenges and security threats. Weve been\n\nQUESTION: Not from Mr. Amro. I mean, hes\n\nMR PRICE: Weve been reminded of that even in recent days.\n\nQUESTION: Hes the subject of attacks.\n\nMR PRICE: We think and there is a way to address those real, those very real security threats while of course respecting the ability of civil society actors, including human rights defenders, to carry out their important work.\n\nWere not going to be prescriptive, but we believe that Israel is in a position to do both.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah. Let me ask you, on your statement last Friday on the IHRA, you said that the recent report by the UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism misrepresented the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism. How did it do that? How did it misrepresent the definition of the IHRA?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, the IHRA definition is a public definition. Thats actually the great effectiveness of it. Its a definition that is available to the world; its a definition that the United States has adopted as a working definition of anti-Semitism going back years now. It helpfully provides examples of what anti-Semitism could look like, illustrative examples of how anti-Semitism can rear its ugly head around the world, and unfortunately how its reared its ugly head around the world in far too many instances, including in far too many recent instances.\n\nSo Im not going to parse the statement that we saw emanate from the UN official compared to the IHRA definition. The good news is that the definition is available for all to see, as is the statement in question.\n\nQUESTION: So you believe that this definition, as it is, would stem the rise of anti-Semitism everywhere?\n\nMR PRICE: Its\n\nQUESTION: And will not it will not jeopardize the Palestinians or Palestinian activists or supporters of the Palestinians to work on behalf of the Palestinian cause\n\nMR PRICE: Its an important tool.\n\nQUESTION: especially in boycott?\n\nMR PRICE: It is an important tool to help policymakers, to help civil society, to help private sector actors determine what ultimately is and what may not be anti-Semitic language or activity. I was looking at the definition myself late last week, and the examples that it lays out provide a very useful tool for those who want to take a look at what may be said, what may be happening around the world, and to provide guideposts for, again, policymakers or anyone else who would be interested in this.\n\nBut it is one tool. Its a tool that the United States Government has used. Its a tool that a number of governments have used. Weve encouraged governments around the world to use it to help inform those policy decisions.\n\nYes, please, Cindy.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. On Ukraine and Russia, with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy laying out his preconditions for any real negotiations with Russia, what is your best understanding of what Russias preconditions would be, and do you see any movement at all there towards negotiations?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, unfortunately, its quite simple when it comes to Russia. We have seen nothing to indicate that the Russians are at the present moment willing to engage in good-faith negotiations. There would be a number of ways the Russians could signal their willingness, their ability to engage in dialogue and diplomacy, good-faith dialogue and diplomacy, with Ukraine. One would be to stop the bombing of civilian targets, to stop pursuing infrastructure, to stop pursuing heating, water, electricity for the people of Ukraine. Another would be to stop with what appears to be, at best, indiscriminate targeting of residential areas, civilian buildings, playgrounds, schools, hospitals, or at worst, the intentional targeting of these same locations.\n\nRussia had an opportunity to demonstrate that it was committed to dialogue and diplomacy by not taking the profoundly unhelpful steps it took just a few days ago by, at least temporarily, suspending the grain initiative, continuing to holding the Black Sea Grain continuing to hold the Black Sea Grain Initiative hostage for some sort of leverage, as the grain initiative comes up for renewal in the coming days.\n\nSo again, it is not for us to be prescriptive to the Ukrainians in this case about what would be indicative of a good-faith willingness on the part of Russia to negotiate. But looking as an observer at what has transpired in Ukraine over the past months and even recent days, we just dont see any indication that Russia is ready and willing to seriously engage.\n\nQUESTION: Bloomberg just Bloomberg mentioned that there may be talks held in Cairo between the Russians and the Americans on the START treaty. Is that something that\n\nMR PRICE: So the Bloomberg report was referring to the New START Treatys Bilateral Consultative Commission, the BCC. Thats the bilateral mechanism for discussing treaty implementation issues under the New START Treaty. We have agreed that the BCC will meet in the near future under the terms of the New START Treaty. The work of the BCC is confidential, but we do hope for a constructive session.\n\nThis gets back to the point we were making yesterday: we believe deeply, around the world, in the transformative power and the importance of diplomacy and dialogue. When it comes to Russia, of course, we are clear eyed, were realistic about what dialogue between the United States and Russia can both what it can entail and what it can accomplish. We we have focused on risk reduction in these conversations, but weve been very intentional about seeing to it that the ability of our two countries to pass messages back and forth and to engage in dialogue has not, does not atrophy.\n\nWe have a number of channels for communication. We have a functioning embassy in Moscow. Secretary Blinken has picked up the phone to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov since February 24th. Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley, Jake Sullivan have all been in a position to speak to Russian counterparts. And here in this building theres a Russian ambassador in Washington, theres a Russian Embassy in Washington. We have the ability to convey the important bilateral message messages that we need to convey.\n\nSo if there is and it sounds like there will be a meeting of the BCC, that is a good thing. It demonstrates our commitment to risk reduction, to strategic stability, something we remain committed to, something that is profoundly in the bilateral interest. And we hope the upcoming meeting is constructive and leads to\n\nQUESTION: When was the last meeting that Ambassador Antonov had in this building?\n\nMR PRICE: I couldnt say when the last time he was I couldnt say when he was last in the building, but we have the ability to convey messages to the Russian embassy here and vice versa. Our embassy in Moscow regularly conveys messages to the Russian MFA.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: Is sorry, you said you kept saying if this meeting happens, and then you said the upcoming meeting. Well, has it actually been a hundred percent agreed to by both sides?\n\nMR PRICE: There will be the the BCC will meet in the near future.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Will Ukraine be part of that discussion? Because you had the policy nothing without Ukraine about Ukraine.\n\nMR PRICE: This is about the New START Treaty. Of course, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine is a cardinal principle that applies to Russias war in Ukraine. The New START Treaty is a treaty between the United States and Russia. It has to do with the disposition of our respective nuclear assets.\n\nQUESTION: And when was the last time that the BCC met?\n\nMR PRICE: The BCC, it was so as you know, this pertains to the New START Treaty. Inspections were paused in March of 2020 by\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, that was because of COVID.\n\nMR PRICE: Well, by because of COVID, by mutual consent, but then they were unilaterally suspended by Russia in August. And weve made clear to Russia that measures imposed as a result of Russias unprovoked war against Ukraine dont prevent Russian inspections Russian inspectors from conducting New START Treaty inspections in the United States. So we hope that the meeting of the BCC will allow us to continue with those inspections.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But the question was when was the last time\n\nMR PRICE: I will see if we can it took place in October of 2021 actually.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so much. Jahanzaib Ali from ARY News TV. Just wanted to request your comments on assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Imran Khan. As per tradition and his habits, hes blaming current Prime Minister Sharif and some intelligences agencies, officials, without any evidence. But what are your comments and thoughts?\n\nMR PRICE: So I think you saw the statement that Secretary Blinken issued last week, shortly after these reports emerged. He said that we strongly condemn the shooting. We continue to strongly condemn the shooting of Imran Khan. We offer our condolences to the family of the individual who was killed. We express our hope for a quick and thorough recovery of all who were injured, including Imran Kahn.\n\nViolence has no place in politics. Were concerned about these reports of violence. We call on all parties to refrain from violence, harassment, intimidation, and to respect the rule of law. We are deeply committed to a democratic and peaceful Pakistan, and we stand with the people of Pakistan.\n\nQUESTION: Pakistan is a close ally of the United States, but the current political chaos taking the nation towards destruction. What would you like to say to the heads of the political party and the military leadership to calm down the situation?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, precisely the message that the Secretary relayed last week and that I reiterated just now: violence has no place in politics. We are concerned about what has happened in Pakistan in recent days. All parties should never resort to violence. They should express their disagreements peacefully, using employing universal rights freedom of expression, freedom of assembly but violence is never the answer. Were deeply committed to Pakistan, which has a long history of and democratic identity. We stand with the people of Pakistan.\n\nQUESTION: We talked about the media freedom recently, but right now criminal cases are being registered against CEO and owner of ARY News Salman Iqbal. According to his close associates, current Pakistani Government with the help of some military officials are behind it and try to involve him in the murder of senior journalist Arshad Sharif. So owner of ARY is not able to go to Pakistan due to threats. We talked about media freedom many times, but things are getting worse. Would you like to say something about that?\n\nMR PRICE: We routinely raise our concerns about press freedom to all stakeholders around the world. We do that as a matter of course in Pakistan. Well continue to have those conversations with Pakistani authorities. A free press, informed citizenry theyre key for any nation and its democratic future. Its key in Pakistan; its key around the world.\n\nQUESTION: So one last question. Indian foreign minister is visiting Moscow very soon, and as you know that India is becoming the largest oil customer Russian oil customer after China and expanding their trade ties. Recently, U.S. Trade Secretary was in India to talk about this or these things. In your opinion, why the United States is not able to convince India to stay away from Russia in this difficult hour?\n\nMR PRICE: So a couple things on that. Weve had a number of high-level engagements with our Indian counterparts in recent weeks and recent months. Just yesterday Deputy Secretary Sherman met with Indian Foreign Secretary Kwatra and had a wideranging discussion about the U.S.India relationship. Secretary Blinken met with Foreign Minister Jaishankar here in this building just a couple of months ago. And there have been a number of conversations in between.\n\nThe messages we heard from Foreign Minister Jaishankar in Russia were not dissimilar in some ways from what we heard from Prime Minister Modi at the UN, when he made it very clear that this is not an era of war. India, again, reaffirmed that it stands against this war, that it wants to see dialogue, it wants to see diplomacy, it wants to see an end to this needless bloodshed that Russia is responsible for inside of Ukraine. Its important that the Russians hear that message from countries around the world. Its especially important that the Russians hear that message from countries like India that are neighbors, that have economic, diplomatic, social, and political might, and thats precisely the message that Foreign Minister Jaishankar delivered.\n\nWhen it comes to Russias Indias relationship with Russia, weve consistently made the point that its a relationship that developed and was cemented over the course of decades, really came to be during the Cold War at a time when the United States was not in a position to be an economic partner, a security partner, a military partner to India. That has changed. Thats changed over the past 25 or so years. Its really a legacy a bipartisan legacy that this country has achieved over the course of the past quarter century. President George W. Bushs administration was really the first to put this into effect.\n\nWe have sought to deepen our partnership with India in every sector, including when it comes to economics, including when it comes to our security ties, including when it comes to our military cooperation as well.\n\nNow, this is a transition that weve always been clear-eyed will not take place overnight, over the course even a few months or probably even over the course of a couple years. India is a large country, a vast country, a large economy that has demanding needs. And so the transition and the reorientation that we hope to see from India is something that this administration will be committed to working with India on. But this will likely be a task not only for this administration but for administrations to come.\n\nQUESTION: (Inaudible) you are saying any country can have trade ties with Russia, can buy their oil, expand their trade ties, but they just need to condemn the Russia on the Ukraine war? And\n\nMR PRICE: No. To be very clear, weve been intentional about exempting oil and gas the energy sector from the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia. So the fact that India has high demand for energy, that it continues to seek oil and other forms of energy from Russia that is not something that runs afoul of the sanctions that have been imposed.\n\nWeve also been clear that now is not the time for business as usual with Russia, and its incumbent on countries around the world to do what they can to lessen those economic ties with Russia. Thats something thats in the collective interest, but its also in the bilateral interest of countries around the world to end and certainly over the course of time to wean their dependence on Russian energy. There have been a number of countries that have learned the hard way of the fact that Russia is not a reliable source of energy. Russia is not a reliable supplier of security assistance. Russia is far from reliable in any realm. So it is not only in the interest of Ukraine, it is not only in the interest of the region, of the collective interests that India decrease its dependence on Russia over time, but its also in Indias own bilateral interest, given what weve seen from Russia.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. There are reports the UK Government is about to announce a major deal to buy natural gas from the United States to ease the energy crisis. Can you tell us more about this the U.S.-UK deal from the U.S. perspective?\n\nMR PRICE: Im not in a position to shed any additional light on those reports. What I can say is that we have worked concertedly with Europe, with our British allies as well when it comes to their energy needs, especially over the course of this winter. Weve taken a number of steps both in the short term and over the longer term to see to it that Europe is more resilient to the shocks that weve experienced and some of the shocks that we may yet experience in the coming months, given, again, Russias continued weaponization of energy.\n\nWe have been in a position to increase our exports of LNG supplies to Europe. Weve been in a position to export to increase our export of oil supplies to Europe. Weve been in a position to surge excess capacity of LNG from other parts of the world to Europe for use this winter. But Im just not in a position to confirm reports of a separate deal.\n\nQUESTION: On just one more question on Serbia-Kosovo talks. According to the Brussels Agreement, Kosovo Government was supposed to allow the formation of the community of the Serbian municipalities in Kosovo, but that did not happen. Does Secretary Blinken want to see this happening, and what is his overall message when it comes to this specific provision of the agreement?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we agree with the European Union that recent developments are of concern; they put important progress achieved at the EU-facilitated dialogue at risk. The Kosovan Serbs withdrawal from Kosovan institutions is not a solution to the current disputes. It has the potential to further escalate the tensions on the ground. All parties must take steps to reduce tensions and to ensure peace and stability. Actions and rhetoric that increase the possibility of violence place innocent lives and those of international peacekeeping forces on the ground at unnecessary risk. Both Kosovo and Serbia should implement the agreements theyve already signed through the dialogue process, and that includes by starting negotiations to establish the Association of Serb-Majority Municipalities.\n\nQUESTION: And what if Kurti decides not to follow on the execution and formation of the municipalities?\n\nMR PRICE: Again, we are urging both parties to follow through with the commitments that they have signed through the EU-facilitated process.\n\nMesfin.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. As usual, my question is about Ethiopia. When you talked about the peace agreement during yesterdays press briefing, you said the following: The parties are in Nairobi in keeping with the provision that the Ethiopian National Defense Force and the Tigrayan Defense Force would meet within five days to work out the implementation. The agreement signed by the Ethiopian Government and TPLF stated that I dont know if you read that agreement agree and recognize that the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has only one defense force page four, article six. Even in the peace agreement signed by both sides, there is also not a single mention of Tigray Defense Force. In the agreement it says TPLF combatants.\n\nWhen you say \"Tigray Defense Force,\" many people before I came here, many people ask me, and that consider that it violates Ethiopias sovereignty. And Ned, many Ethiopians and Ethiopian Americans are asking you why did you choose to say the Tigrayan Defense Force instead of TPLF or TPLF combatants or fighters or rebels. Whats your response to them?\n\nMR PRICE: So Mesfin, the parties are moving to Nairobi. They have moved to Nairobi to continue the important dialogue that was cemented in Pretoria. These are precisely the types of issues that theyre discussing in Nairobi. The AU is following up with talks focused on the implementation of the cessation of hostilities agreement, the establishment of a joint verification and monitoring mechanism, and the military-to-military talks between the Ethiopian National Defense Force and the Tigrayan Defense Forces. And our Special Envoy Mike Hammer will continue to participate in the process as an observer.\n\nThe agreement that was reached between the parties in Pretoria was itself hugely important, but implementation of the agreement is crucial to making sure the cessation of hostilities sticks and, importantly, to seeing a resumption of the flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of northern Ethiopia, including to the people of Tigray. So we are going to remain engaged with the parties. We are going to continue to be a partner to the AU, which continues to lead this process, and right now the responsibility is on the parties who are in Nairobi continuing those talks, including those military-to-military talks, to see to it that this agreement has followthrough.\n\nAnything else?\n\nQUESTION: I havent finished yet.\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: When the peace agreement between the Ethiopian Government and TPLF achieves its purpose, it will be an honest triumph in the in the eyes of many people, peaceloving people like me. We pray that this peace agreement achieves its purpose. Ned, what kind of support the United States provides so that this peace agreement does not fall apart?\n\nMR PRICE: We are continuing to remain engaged. As I said just a moment ago, Special Envoy Hammer is in Nairobi. He is there as an observer, as he was in Pretoria. Ultimately, however, this is an AU-led process. We played a role as a facilitator for the parties, supporting the AU. There are instances in which we have expertise, in which we have capacity to help the parties. We provided that where it was appropriate for us to do so, but ultimately, were in support of this AU process, in support of the prospects for a permanent peace that brings stability, security, and humanitarian relief to the people of northern Ethiopia.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned, but if you have time, I have also unplanned interaction with Secretary Blinken at the White House, which is a good one. If you give me permission, I will say it later, but continue.\n\nMR PRICE: Great. Thank you, thank you.\n\n(inaudible) please.\n\nQUESTION: I wonder if you could share with us any additional detail on the path ahead for assistance to Ukraine coming this winter since winter is fast approaching, especially the timeline when Assistant Secretary Pyatt might be able to bring the parties together to provide assistance that is effective and\n\nMR PRICE: Well, to be clear, this assistance has been ongoing for some time now. We have spent quite a bit of time on the security assistance weve provided to our Ukrainian partners, to the economic assistance weve provided, to the humanitarian assistance. But what weve been able to provide in terms of infrastructure, thats something that has been ongoing for some time and its something where we intend to intensify our efforts. Its why we announced today that Assistant Secretary Pyatt is going to lead the efforts on behalf of the U.S. Government, coordinating closely with departments and agencies but also with our international partners.\n\nYou may have seen that at the conclusion of the G7 ministerial last week in Mnster, Germany the G7 established a coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore, defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. They made note of an upcoming December 13th international conference in Paris aimed at supporting Ukraines civilian resilience. Its a conference that will be organized by and co-hosted by both Ukraine and France. This is something where its a forum where the United States will be deeply engaged as well.\n\nBut as we intensify these efforts, there are a number of steps that need to be taken. We need to survey what exactly it is, working closely with our Ukrainian partners the needs they have to determine how best we can assist them. There are different elements to this. Its restoration, its repair, but its also strengthening and fortifying Ukraines infrastructure resilience. These are all elements that were committed to. Were going to coordinate closely with the G7 but also partners around the world to see to it that we can optimize that delivery of assistance for Ukraines infrastructure and energy needs.\n\nAny other\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, Ive got\n\nQUESTION: One is you said in your opening statement that Putin has failed in battlefield and now hes waging on a war on energy infrastructure and were going to make sure that he fails there too. Can you give us a little more on that? So in the short term, what are you going to do to make him fail faster?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we are going to continue to carry out the approach that has really been at the heart of our efforts since even before President Putin ordered his forces into Ukraine. It has been really a strategy thats been twofold when it comes to Ukraine and Russia. One is to provide Ukraine with the assistance that it needs to defend itself thats the security assistance but also the assistance that it needs to ensure that its people are resilient thats the economic assistance, thats the humanitarian assistance, thats the direct budgetary support that is part of that as well.\n\nWe are also going to continue down the path that we set forward very clearly prior to February 24th. Thats the path of severe costs and consequences for Russia. Weve collectively enacted hundreds of sanctions on the Russian Government, impacting the Russian economy, the export controls that have in many ways hamstrung key strategic sectors for the Kremlin. Weve seen the Kremlin have to resort to partners with whom it has previously not had the type of relationship its seeking out now. That includes with Iran. That includes with the DPRK.\n\nSo I think were seeing across the board the costs, the consequences of this strategy, and were seeing the ways in which it is helping our Ukrainian partners be effective in their efforts to defend their country, to defend their territory, to defend their democracy.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQUESTION: And can I also\n\nMR PRICE: We need to we need to move on, Alex. Thanks.\n\nMatt.\n\nQUESTION: Just before I get to two Americans detained overseas, I want to just ask you if you real quickly, if you had any thoughts or comments on the these comments allegedly made by the Qatars World Cup ambassador about homosexuality being \"damage in the mind.\" Did you notice those? Do you have anything to say about that?\n\nMR PRICE: I have noticed those. Of course, we have a strategic partnership with Qatar. We have a relationship with Qatar that allows us to discuss our areas of mutual interest, but it also allows us to discuss what is important to the United States. And values of tolerance, of diversity, of respecting all people regardless of who they are or whom they love, these are the types of discussions that were in a position to have with our Qatari partners. Obviously those partners those comments excuse me were of great concern and I suspect well be addressing that directly.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So youre saying that if, for instance, there was a meeting between a senior Qatari and U.S. officials in the coming days or weeks or month, this would be a topic that would be raise these comments specifically?\n\nMR PRICE: We regularly engage our Qatari partners, including when it comes to issues of human rights. So we take advantage of every appropriate opportunity we have to do that.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Staying on human rights, are you familiar with this case of an American woman who was just arrested, detained yesterday in Saudi Arabia, Carly Morris?\n\nMR PRICE: I am, yes.\n\nQUESTION: Do you have anything to\n\nMR PRICE: Were aware of the reports that Ms. Morris has been detained. Of course, the safety, the welfare of U.S. citizens overseas is the highest priority we have at the Department of State. We take our role in assisting U.S. citizens abroad extremely seriously. Whenever a person is detained abroad, we seek immediate access to visit the individual, to aid him or her with all appropriate consular assistance. Our embassy in Riyadh is very engaged on this case; theyre following the situation very closely.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So does that mean that the Saudis notified you that she they had detained her?\n\nMR PRICE: Were aware of this case. Im just not going to speak to that.\n\nQUESTION: Well, okay. Have you been able to has any consular officer been able to meet with her?\n\nMR PRICE: This was a case that has just come to my attention in the past few hours. If we have an update to provide, well do that.\n\nQUESTION: And then I wanted to follow up on my questions yesterday about Theary Seng in Cambodia, and to just ask you if there has been a change in the determination or if youre making a semantic argument that unjustly detained is not the same thing as wrongfully detained under the terms of the Levinson Act.\n\nMR PRICE: Sure. No, Matt, there has been no change in our determination or the way in which we are prioritizing this case. This case, of course, is a priority for us. I do appreciate the opportunity to make clear just how deeply concerned we are by the mass conviction in June of this year of opposition activists in Cambodia, including Theary Seng, who was convicted along with this group. The sentencing of these opposition activists, many of whom are associated with the now-disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party, is the latest instance in an alarming pattern of threats, of intimidation, of persecution of opposition political leaders and parties.\n\nThese actions undermine multiparty democracy and the rule of law. We believe that all Cambodians should be in a position to exercise their human rights, to express their views freely, to assemble peacefully, to choose their leaders, and we call on Cambodian authorities to release all those unjustly detained, including Theary Seng, and to protect freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, consistent with Cambodias constitution and its international obligations and commitments. We stand with the Cambodian people. We are steadfast in support of their aspirations for greater democracy and human rights.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But you but youre making a distinction between unjustly detained, which you just repeated there, and wrongfully detained, right?\n\nMR PRICE: We could spend quite a while on the semantics. I think\n\nQUESTION: I dont want to. I just want to know if you think that theres a Im not the one its look, wrongfully detained means that her case would be transferred to SPEHA office, right? And she and it\n\nMR PRICE: And this is\n\nQUESTION: would be treated slightly differently or differently than a the case just an average case of an American detained abroad.\n\nMR PRICE: This is a matter that youre referring to of where something is handled internally, deep within our bureaucracy. What matters most is that we have called for her release, we have called for all of those to be released who are unjustly held as political prisoners in Cambodia, around the world. We call for the release of political prisoners, those who are unjustly held on political grounds in countries around the world.\n\nWhen it comes to how we characterize any particular case, this is one of the areas where we have an obligation to follow the law. There is the Robert Levinson legislation its legislation that spells out a number of criteria that any particular case would need to satisfy if we are to make the formal determination that someone is wrongfully detained. What happens in such cases is that our special presidential envoy for hostage affairs would then be responsible for that case. In this case, we have called Seng Theary we have called her unjustly detained. We believe she should be released, as should all of those human rights defenders and activists who were sentenced and convicted alongside her.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, I just I cant understand. If she is an unjustly detained political prisoner and an American citizen, why is that not why does that not meet the criteria for SPEHA to take over?\n\nMR PRICE: What I can tell you, Matt, is that we look at the totality of circumstances of any particular case, and we marry the facts relevant to any particular case with the criteria that is spelled out by Congress in the Levinson legislation. We never close the book on any particular\n\nQUESTION: Okay, well, what criteria does she not meet?\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, Im just not going to litigate publicly the particulars of an American citizens case. This is something we take a close look at privately. This is something that were always looking at. We never close the book when it comes to a wrongful detainee determination. If information emerges, new information emerges, or if information is portrayed in a different light, we of course will look closely at that. But what I can tell you, what is most important to this case is that it is a priority for us Secretary Blinken raised it with Hun Sen when we were there in August. We have called for the release of Seng Theary and for all of those who were convicted alongside of her.\n\nQUESTION: The problem the problem with your answer, though, is that it leaves the door open that for people to get the impression that you think that there might be some legitimacy behind either her detention, or her prison sentence, or her transfer up to a prison in the very remote north of the country.\n\nMR PRICE: We are making very clear\n\nQUESTION: Do you think that theres anything legitimate about this?\n\nMR PRICE: We are being very clear in calling for the release of all of the human rights defenders and activists that were sentenced alongside of her, including the release of Seng Theary.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, but shes an American citizen, and you had you said every day you get up here and say that your number-one priority is the safety and welfare of Americans overseas. Now, you can call for the release of all 60 all you want, but dont you doesnt this building believe that its got a special obligation toward an American citizen who has been\n\nMR PRICE: Of course. And\n\nQUESTION: caught up\n\nMR PRICE: And of course, Matt, the\n\nQUESTION: in this and unjustly detained?\n\nMR PRICE: The level of support that we have provided to Seng Theary as an American citizen is categorically different from what we are doing for those who do not have U.S. citizenship. We have a special\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, but its also different than what youve been giving to, say, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and to people who are not even American citizens, like the case of\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, youre really talking about\n\nQUESTION: in Rwanda that was mentioned earlier.\n\nMR PRICE: Youre really talking about boxes within an organizational chart. What matters to us is that\n\nQUESTION: Really? If it was just a box within an organizational chart, why did you make such a big deal about it when you found when you determined that Brittney Griner was wrongfully detained and transfer her case to SPEHA?\n\nMR PRICE: Because, Matt, in that case, when she was deemed to be wrongfully detained, we called for her to be released. Before that, as you may remember, we made the point that we were providing all appropriate assistance.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, well then, I\n\nMR PRICE: There is no distinction in this case.\n\nQUESTION: But I dont get it, because youre calling her youre saying that this case in Cambodia, youre calling for her to be released and you have been since she was sentenced back in June. So I dont understand what\n\nMR PRICE: Matt, I there\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMR PRICE: This may be one of those issues where perhaps you and a couple other people around the world are deeply fixated on this. What I hope people are deeply fixated on is the fact that were calling for her release. We believe that she, along with all those who were convicted in the trial, were are held unjustly and should be released. This is a conversation weve had at the highest levels with Cambodian leadership, and I expect that well continue to have those conversations.\n\nThank you.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:10 p.m.)",

Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didnt know if its drones were used against Ukraine and stated Irans commitment to stopping the conflict.\n\nUkrenergo, the sole operator of Ukraines high-voltage transmission lines, initially said in an online statement Saturday that scheduled blackouts will take place in the capital and the greater Kyiv region, as well as several regions around it Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv.\n\nA woman stands next to the remains of a residential building in Mykolaiv. Carl Court / Getty Images\n\nLater in the day, however, the company released an update saying that scheduled outages for a specific number of hours arent enough and instead there will be emergency outages, which could last an indefinite amount of time.\n\nUkraine has been grappling with power outages and the disruption of water supplies since Russia started unleashing massive barrages of missile and drone strikes on the countrys energy infrastructure last month.\n\nMoscow has said those came in response to what it alleged were Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, the region that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine has denied those allegations.\n\nAccording to Ukraines presidential office, at least three civilians were killed, and eight others were wounded over the past 24 hours by Russian shelling of nine Ukrainian regions, where drones, missiles and heavy artillery were used.\n\nA worker repairs damaged lines after a missile strike on a power plant in an undisclosed part of Ukraine.

Valentyn Reznichenko said on Telegram. The Russian forces targeted the city and the areas around it with heavy artillery, as they have done repeatedly since July. Two fires broke out, and more than a dozen residential and utility buildings, as well as a gas pipeline, were damaged, he said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Ukrainian forces shot down a drone and another projectile, according to Reznichenko.\n\nIn the southern Mykolaiv region, the overnight shelling of rural areas damaged several houses but didnt cause any casualties, Mykolaiv Gov.

                "cc_text": "It has become abundantly clear that absent battlefield successes, Russia is now going to make the Ukrainian people suffer as badly as possible via conventional attacks on critical infrastructure in an attempt to break their will. This strategy has been highlighted by the now constant strikes on Ukrainian power generation and electricity distribution infrastructure via cruise missiles and Iranian long-range suicide drones.\n\nNow, just as we predicted, all indications point to Russia acquiring hundreds of Iranian short-range ballistic missiles, like the Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar types. This is a much bigger problem than many seem to realize, including for those living in the vast majority of Ukrainian territory that remains outside of Moscow's control. Simply put, these weapons will be very challenging if not impossible for Ukraine to defend against, they pack a major punch, and they can strike nearly anywhere in the country, putting Ukraine's already battered energy infrastructure, in particular, at extreme risk.\n\nWhile the unsettling truth here is that Ukraine will have very little means of defending its electricity infrastructure, and other targets for that matter, from attacks by imported Iranian ballistic missiles, Russia's dwindling stockpile of cruise missiles, as well as Iranian-provided drones, have already taken their toll on the country's energy ecosystem. But Ukraine's defenses against these 'air breathing' weapons have been improving and they are now on the precipice of making a major capability leap.\n\nAuthor's note: This post was adapted from an October 19th Twitter thread by the author.\n\nThe arrival of NASAMS will drastically improve Ukraine's ability to protect key population centers from these attacks, and the first German IRIS-T SLM systems delivered to the country are already hard at work doing so. Both are uniquely suited to localized area air defense against these threats. NASAMS, in particular, with its deep supply of ammunition in the form of AIM-120 AMRAAMs a critical feature that you can read all about here will be especially effective in this regard. But defending against low-flying cruise missiles and drones reliably is very challenging for even the world's most advanced air defense network, so even with these upgrades, significant numbers of these weapons could still leak through. Regardless, the key point here is that neither of these Western air defense systems provides any sort of robust ability to intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles that could arrive at any moment.\n\nNASAMS is a very capable medium-range air defense system, but it will not be able to robustly defend against Russian attacks using Iranian ballistic missiles. (Raytheon/Kongsberg Defense)\n\nUkrainian air defenders have also done a highly commendable job with the limited means they already have at knocking down cruise missiles and drones before they reach their intended targets, with Kyiv often claiming that the majority of those launched get intercepted. But still, look at the damage they have done. Hundreds of Iranian ballistic missiles entering the equation will seriously bend those metrics in a very negative way.\n\nUkraines prized, but severely dated Soviet-designed S-300s, which continue to have their arsenal of interceptors whittled down over nine months of continuous warfare, have limited anti-ballistic missile capabilities, especially against modern types. The country's tiny handful of S-300Vs are the only ones that could really be charged with such a mission. Even then, they can only do so over a relatively finite localized area. It is unknown if even they could be able to effectively intercept Iran's latest SRBM designs even under the best of conditions.\n\nLYSYCHANSK, UKRAINE JUNE 12, 2022: A military rocket launcher drives on a highway towards Lysychansk, Ukraine, Sunday June 12, 2022. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images). Getty Images vio Marcus Yam\n\nThese air defense systems are also critical to keeping traditional Russian fixed-wing and rotary-wing airpower at bay confined to very near or just beyond the front lines at the farthest. Keeping this pressure on Russian airpower is absolutely critical. Russia can not be allowed to gain air superiority, or even heavily contest Ukraine's claim on its own airspace over the territory it controls, and bring its conventional airpower to bear across Ukraine. So, relocating them in the hopes of providing some defense around key high-value targets is problematic. The delivery of additional Western air defense systems even dated ones could help free them up sometime in the future, but once again, it is unlikely they would provide an effective defense.\n\nIranian short-range ballistic missiles will be very challenging for Ukraine to counter. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nWhile Russia has Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles still in its inventory, their use has declined drastically. Russia needs to keep enough of these dual-use (conventional and nuclear) capable weapons for strategic purposes; they can't just wind the stock down to nothing.\n\nThe Iskander-Ms and Russia's standoff cruise missiles, complex and expensive weapons, are all very hard to replace with production taking time during the best conditions, let alone when the country is under crushing sanctions and technology embargoes. This is why Iran being a source of these types of weapons is so key to Russia, especially considering Tehran has developed organic production capabilities with supply chains that circumvent sanctions and much of the international community's interdiction efforts. You can read more about this unique situation in our initial piece on the possibility of Russia importing ballistic missiles from Iran.\n\nFateh-110 missiles entered mass production years ago in Iran and their stockpile is likely very plentiful. (FARS News Agency)\n\nAlso, it must be made clear that ballistic missiles hit much harder than cruise missiles and pack far larger warheads than long-range suicide drones. The accuracy of Iran's short-range ballistic missiles has become impressive, and their precision is more than adequate to pummel Ukraine's energy production and electricity distribution nodes into ruin, causing potentially catastrophic damage. They are also operationally proven, including against the U.S. and allied interests in Iraq. Iran's SRBMs are also known to be quite fast and, in some cases, maneuverable, making them harder to intercept and providing enhanced kinetic effects against even fortified targets. In our October 28th interview with Ukraine's intelligence chief, Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov highlighted similar concerns:\n\nTWZ: How concerned are you about the Iranian short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar SRBMs capable of striking targets at distances of between 186 and 435 miles that are coming to Russia? And when do you think those will get there? KB: I believe that likely that next month we'll see them used here. TWZ: And how concerned are you about that threat? KB: It's a serious threat because Iranian missiles, unlike Russian ones, are quite high precision, very high speed and those features have been battle proven.\n\nAs a result of all these factors, the potential introduction of Iranian SBRMs puts Ukraine's electricity infrastructure at immense risk and that risk comes at the worst possible time, as the cold of winter begins to set in.\n\nIn order to have a good chance of countering Russia's Iranian-built ballistic missiles, Ukraine would need the MIM-104 Patriot air defense system, which is optimized for intercepting SRBMs and has done so repeatedly in the past. While it has been floated, even at the highest levels, that the Patriot is being considered for Ukraine, even if it were declared today that the United States would provide them, it would take many months of training to get them ready to deploy. Patriot is a highly complex system that requires unique technical expertise not just to operate, but also to sustain. While it's possible that 'contractors' could be provided to run and support Patriot batteries 'given' to Ukraine, such a move would seem unlikely as it can be viewed as outright involvement in the conflict beyond supplying weapons and external support. The U.S. and NATO have done everything possible not to cross that line so far and there are no indications that this is about to change, but it's always possible.\n\nPatriot missile interceptor on its way toward its target. (US ARMY)\n\nBeyond that, giving Patriot batteries to Ukraine would also represent a major technological risk that the U.S. may not be willing to swallow at this time. There are also not many surplus batteries just laying around. In fact, even for the U.S., Patriot batteries are relatively prized assets, especially for potential contingency operations, that it or its allies would have to relinquish. Considering the threat level in Europe for NATO and for the U.S., around the world, providing batteries to Ukraine could be seen as inviting unacceptable risk elsewhere.\n\nYes, I know this is a bleak outlook, but it's the reality Ukraine will face if indeed Iranian ballistic missiles show up as all indications point to at this time.\n\nThe questions of just how many ballistic missiles can be provided and how fast they can be resupplied remain outstanding, with estimates varying. At least a couple of hundred missiles are thought to be part of the initial series of deliveries, but Iran needs cash badly and they are sitting on a substantial stockpile of these weapons and could potentially ramp up production significantly with financial backing from Russia. License production/assembly in Russia is also eventually a possibility. Still, even a couple hundred of these weapons, reaching their targets unmolested, could spell disaster for Ukraine's already under-pressure electricity grid. And it's not just about electricity production, but even more so distribution, and Russia is well aware of this and will adjust its targeting accordingly.\n\nKYIV REGION, UKRAINE - NOVEMBER 04: Workers repair infrastructure in a power station that was damaged by a Russian air attack in October, on November 04, 2022 in Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine. Electricity and heating outages across Ukraine caused by missile and drone strikes to energy infrastructure have added urgency to preparations for winter. (Photo by Ed Ram/Getty Images)\n\nAnd of course, these weapons also pose a major threat to other targets, especially those in the western reaches of Ukraine where key supply routes and other essential logistics are established and have been able to operate under reduced threat since Russia failed to gain air superiority early on. Still, Russia's recent current focus on attacking Ukraine's electrical grid is clearly indicative of what these missiles will be used for.\n\nThe good news here is that Ukrainians have proven to be tough as nails and are highly adaptable to changing wartime conditions. Still, we could see another exodus west if power to major cities, including Kyiv, proves to be totally unreliable if available at all going into the depths of winter.\n\nIt has also been interesting to see the lack of international pressure on Iran for supplying these weapons to Russia. While the country is already under heavy sanctions, there are still levers to be pulled, even if primarily diplomatic ones. Interdicting them is a whole other escalation risk, but doing so really isn't possible as they would either be flown via airlifter and/or delivered via the Caspian Sea by ship.\n\nThe use of Iranian SRBMs, especially if they are used in part to destroy Ukraine's power grid, will only increase calls for the U.S. to supply MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) short-range ballistic missiles to Ukraine. While this system has already achieved almost legendary status without ever rolling onto the battlefield in Ukraine, the Biden Administration has made it clear they are not interested in supplying them, at least at this time.\n\nATACMS fired from an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launcher. (U.S. Army photo)\n\nEven though Ukraine has said it will only use U.S. weapons inside its rightful territory, there are real fears that supplying them could lead to a major escalation between Russia and NATO, especially if they end up hitting targets in Russia. While the M31 guided rockets HIMARS and the M270 MLRS can fire have been hugely impactful on the battlefield, ATACMS has nearly four and a half times the range and roughly two and a half times the warhead size as those munitions. It also hits with much greater kinetic energy. So we are talking about a very different class of weapon that would put any target in Crimea in range and under threat.\n\nSo how can the potentially devastating use of Iranian SRBMs by Russia against Ukrainian targets be deterred? One possibility I mentioned a few weeks ago is to draw a line in the sand so to speak and tell Russia if they import and use Iranian SRBMs, the U.S. would supply Ukraine with ATACMS. While this sort of brinksmanship would be seen as clearly unfavorable by some, it could influence Russia's calculus and it would provide a clear pretext for supplying ATACMS to Ukraine. The messaging is simple, if Moscow is going to import SRBMs to use on the battlefield in Ukraine, then Kyiv should be able to do the same.\n\nI do not endorse or reject such a move, but it is worth discussing as time for such messaging is quickly slipping away.\n\nWith the supposed timeline of delivery of Iranian SRBMs to Russia winding down, it's very likely we will see these weapons in action in the relatively near future. If they decimate Ukraine's power infrastructure, calls for more advanced anti-ballistic missile capable air defenses will grow very loud as will demands for giving Kyiv similar weapons so that such attacks do not go unchecked. No matter what, like the delivery of Iran's Shahed-136 suicide drones before them, these missiles use will mark a new phase of a war that so far has no end in sight and the devastation they could bring may change the calculus of the conflict on all sides.",

The International Atomic Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that promotes nuclear power, opened an exhibit at the UN climate gathering of global leaders in Sharm El-Sheikh, for the first time in 27 years of international climate negotiations. The IAEA said: Many countries faced with sharply rising energy costs and heightened security of supply concerns are turning to nuclear power. US special climate envoy John Kerry announced the US Export-Import Banks formal interest in providing $3bn in financial support for a nuclear plant in Romania. He told reporters: We have a viable alternative in nuclear This is one of the ways in which we can achieve net-zero. We dont get to net zero by 2050 without nuclear power in the mix. Kerry also announced the creation of a carbon offset plan designed to help developing countries speed up their transition away from fossil fuels.

Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, has sent us his thoughts on the US mid-term elections and what they mean for US policy going forward. While the results remain too close to call, the Republicans are on course to win only the narrowest of majorities in the House, and control of the Senate will probably be decided by another run-off election in Georgia in a months time. Perhaps the biggest implication of the midterms is that the chances of Donald Trump returning as president in 2024 appear to have taken a hit. Despite rampant inflation and President Joe Bidens low approval rating, the Democrats have avoided the heavy defeat that many anticipated. Although the Republicans are still expected to win control of the House, they look set for a majority of five seats or fewer, leaving presumptive Speaker Kevin McCarthy beholden to Marjorie Taylor Greene and other members of the Freedom Caucus. Recall that the Freedom Caucus scuppered McCarthys bid for the speakership after John Boehner resigned in 2015. Boehners post-retirement warning that the Freedom Caucus \"cant tell you what theyre for. They can tell you everything theyre against. Theyre anarchists. They want total chaos,\" could come back to haunt McCarthy. The race for the Senate stands on a knife-edge, with each party on 48 seats and the remaining four races potentially unlikely to be called for days. As happened in 2020, overall control of the Senate will probably not be decided until a likely run-off election in Georgia on 6th December. Regardless of which way that race goes, a narrow Republican victory in the House would spell the end for President Joe Bidens domestic agenda, and the potential for further big shifts in fiscal policy. It would also raise the risks of another crisis over the Federal debt ceiling next summer although, for that reason, the Democrats are likely to try and raise the ceiling themselves during the lame duck session. The House Republicans will launch investigations of the administration and could attempt impeachment, but that wouldnt go anywhere with the Senate set to remain close to 50-50 either way. Perhaps the most important takeaway from the midterms is the disappointing performances of many Republican candidates publicly backed by Trump, which came alongside a resounding re-election victory for Republican Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis. With DeSantis already seen as Trumps main challenger for the Republican nomination in 2024, and tipped to beat Biden if he progressed to the final ballot, there may now be a higher chance of a Republican victory in 2024 potentially heralding the return of market-friendly tax cutting policies, but without the chaos that characterised much of Trumps first term.\n\nUpdated at 10.03 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 08.29 EST Undertaker Dignity sees spike in deaths in recent weeks, 'reason unknown' The funeral services company Dignity reported a 14% drop in underlying revenue to 204.7m in the 39 weeks to 30 September, when the number of deaths in the UK fell 3% to 469,000. Underlying operating profits fell sharply, by 68%, to 14.1m. The group conducted 58,200 funerals in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 59,900 a year earlier. The average revenue per funeral has gone down to 2,095 from 2,505, as more people opted for lower-cost funerals such as direct cremations (with no service, mourners or ceremony). As demand rose, the average price per cremation dropped to 863 from 891. Dignity noted that in the last few weeks deaths had risen almost a fifth above the five-year average, adding: The reason for this spike in the death rate is currently unknown. The impact of Covid-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 could possibly mean we experience a fluctuating number of deaths than originally anticipated by the Office of National Statistics in 2022 and 2023. James Brumby, financial analyst at Langton Capital, tweets: On a more macabre note, undertaker Dignity $DTY reports \"In the first few weeks of Q4 deaths are c19% above the five-year average. The reason for this spike in the death rate is currently unknown\"\n\nWell that sounds worrying...

Mark Zuckerbergs mea culpa statement is unlikely to do the trick of reassuring investors, instead they may be further rattled by his admission he over-estimated the companys prospects. Its clear he expected the surge in online advertising experienced during the pandemic to continue and under-estimated just how quickly rivals could entice users away. Given that the jobs cuts were already expected and had largely been priced in, the focus will now be on the monumental task Meta faces to claw back revenue. It faces an uphill battle in its attempt to attract younger audiences who are now dancing to the Pied Piper tunes of TikTok, or setting up groups and channels on Discord and Telegram. At the same time Meta funds are being poured down into the dark plumbing of the metaverse, and its highly unclear when revenues will emerge from this expensive venture. He may have taken responsibility for the current situation, but he is still using the same language of shifting resources to high priority growth areas, and the metaverse still features on that list.\n\n9 Nov 2022 07.22 EST Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, said: Shares in Meta are trading higher by more than 4% after Facebooks parent company confirmed speculation that it is planning to slash the size of its workforce in an attempt to rein in costs amid this years share price plummet. Meta is cutting staff by over 11,000 this year as it grapples with softening ad revenues and cost inflation. It follows Metas extremely disappointing quarterly earnings report last month which sent shares down 20% after it forecast a weak Christmas quarter and higher costs next year. Meta is the latest company in the tech sector to announce major layoffs, following similar moves from Twitter, Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon lately. Within Big Tech, Meta is the standout underperformer this year, shedding more than 70% of its stock market value. Meta has also been facing criticism for betting too heavily on the Metaverse, a gamble that so far has not paid off. Its Reality Labs division, which hosts its VR headsets has lost over $9bn during the first three quarters of the year. The wider tech sector has been in turmoil lately on the back of higher inflation and rising interest rates with the removal of the punch bowl of cheap money turning investors away from tech, which has long been the stock markets favourite sector until an abrupt sea change came about this year.\n\n9 Nov 2022 06.40 EST Facebook owner Meta to cut over 11,000 jobs, Zuckerberg admits he got it wrong The Facebook owner Meta said it would axe more than 11,000 staff, equivalent to 13% of its workforce, as its founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted he \"got [it] wrong\" and things are much worse than he expected. The job losses come after thousands of layoffs at other big tech companies, including Microsoft and Twitter following the latters purchase by the worlds richest man Elon Musk. The pandemic boom for technology companies turned to bust this year with sky-high inflation, rising interest rates and a cost of living crisis. The first round of redundancies in the companys 18-year history comes after its workforce peaked this year at 87,314 people. In a message to employees, Zuckerberg said that the company had over-invested at the start of Covid, banking that the increase in online activity would continue after the pandemic. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than Id expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that. He said the company would shift resources to \"high priority growth areas\" such as its AI discovery engine, ads and business platforms, and its metaverse project. Meta said it would pay 16 weeks of base salary plus two additional weeks pay for every year of service as part of its severance packages, and all remaining paid time off. Employees will also get cost of healthcare for six months and those affected will receive their 15 November vesting. The company plans to cut discretionary spending and extend its hiring freeze through the first quarter of next year. Facebook shares rose 3% in pre-market trading. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

With the company warning of job losses as early as July this year, it is clear that the business has been struggling for some time. Brand reputation and customer service are integral to the success of any business, particularly in the current climate. Operating in such a fiercely competitive space as homewares provides additional challenges. After increasingly lengthy delivery times caused by supply chain and logistic issues, it appears that many customers began to cancel orders and seek refunds. With a business like Made.com much of the value lies in its intellectual property, technology, and branding. The administrators have maximised that value by way of a sale. Popular high street retailer Next has bought the brand, websites and intellectual property after the companys co-founder and former bosss offer to purchase was rejected. Economic pressure continues to mount for the e-commerce sector, with the share price of online fashion giant ASOS also reportedly falling by more than 80% earlier this year, as well as the recent demise of online mattress retailer Eve Sleep. As consumers continue to tighten their belts due to of the cost-of-living crisis, retailers will have to work harder to entice purchasers, particularly for luxury or high-value items.\n\n9 Nov 2022 06.12 EST Nicola Thompson, chief executive office of Made.com, said: I would like to sincerely apologise to everyone - customers, employees, supplier partners, shareholders and all other stakeholders - impacted as a result of the business going into administration. Over the past months we have fought tooth and nail to rapidly re-size the cost base, re-engineer the sourcing and stock model, and try every possible avenue to raise fresh financing and avoid this outcome. The brand will now continue under new owners. I hope that a reconfigured Made will prove to be sustainable and will continue to be loved by customers. Zelf Hussain, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said: It is with real regret that redundancies will need to be made. We would like to thank all the employees for their hard work. We will continue to support those affected at this difficult time, including assisting the HR teams efforts to secure staff new roles. A small number of employees have been retained to support the orderly closure of the business.\n\nUpdated at 06.16 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 06.11 EST Made.com axes 320 staff The collapse of the online furniture retailer Made.com into administration will result in 320 redundancies across the business today, according to the administrators PwC. A further 79 employees who had resigned and were working their notice have been let go with immediate effect. The business has 573 permanent employees, warehouses in the UK and Belgium, alongside offices and showrooms in London, Europe and Vietnam. The sale of the brand, website and intellectual property of the company to the fashion and homewares chain Next does not include staff. You can read the full PwC statement here. It also has some information for customers who are waiting for outstanding deliveries: Close to 4,500 customer orders in the UK and Europe which are already with carriers are being delivered. However, a large proportion of customer orders are still at origin in the Far East at various stages of production. Due to the impact of the business entering administration, these items cannot be completed and shipped to customers. In this case you will need to submit a claim in the administration, details about how to submit a claim are available in the creditor section above.\n\nUpdated at 06.18 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 05.58 EST Marks & Spencer also said this morning that there is no threat to Christmas turkey supplies from avian flu. CEO Stuart Machin told reporters: Weve got very strong plans in place so I think were in good shape. Christmas is protected around turkeys. The company typically sells one in four fresh turkeys eaten in the UK at Christmas in its food halls or M&S Simply Food shops.\n\nUpdated at 06.17 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 05.52 EST ITV shares slump amid modest World Cup boost, ad fears Mark Sweney Shares in ITV fell sharply after the broadcaster forecast a lukewarm revenue boost from airing the World Cup, heightening investor fears that the cost of living crisis is set to hit the UK ad market. The UKs largest commercial broadcaster said on Wednesday that total ad revenues, including TV, digital and sponsorship, fell 2% in the nine months to the end of September. In its last financial report the broadcaster said it expected income to be \"broadly flat\" for the period. ITVs figures show a steady deterioration in the UK ad market since the middle of the year with August down 21% and September falling 14%. Overall, third quarter ad revenue will be down 14% year-on-year. Forecasts for November and December - which with the World Cup and the annual Christmas marketing blitz traditionally means an advertising bonanza - will see a modest boost of just 3% and 5% to 10% year-on-year. \"Relative to the overall UK ad market ITV has done ok,\" said one senior executive at a media agency. \"The problem is the rapid decline in the second half which was not expected. Overall the fourth quarter is going to be flat, and that is with a World Cup, which nobody was expecting when forecasting ad spend in the summer. When the World Cup is in June it drives double digit growth, and ITVs December forecast will only hold up if England progress to the quarter finals and beyond. ITV will have hoped for much better.\" Rattled investors sent ITVs share price down more than 6% in morning trading on Wednesday, making it one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE-250. Strong double-digit growth at ITV Studios, which makes shows including Im A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Hells Kitchen and A Spy Among Friends, failed to temper market sentiment.\n\nUpdated at 05.54 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 05.21 EST Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: The pace of transformation at M&S continues to accelerate and is feeding through to some notable progress. For once, it is not the food business, but the revitalised clothing & home unit which is showing the greatest signs of promise. Previously seen as a dowdy and limited shopping experience, M&S has invested heavily in changing perceptions of style, while also adding an increasingly strong online alternative to the offering. Indeed, the M&S app now has four million users and accounts for 32% of overall clothing & home sales. For all of the progress, and even with the traditionally strongest final quarter in play, the outlook for the next year is cloudy for reasons which are largely outside the companys control. The festive period and a rarely timed World Cup competition should provide a shorter term boost, while M&S is at pains to point out that a fair proportion of its customers are ones with a higher income and age demographic. Even so, the deteriorating economic outlook has ravaged the share prices of retailers in general, and M&S is no exception, with the shares having fallen by 38% over the last year, as compared to a decline of 20% for the wider FTSE-250. Despite an increasingly attractive valuation in historical terms, the tide has not yet turned in the companys favour, with the market consensus stuck for the moment at a hold [rating on the shares].",

When I arrived at the offices in September for an interview with President Tsai Ing-wen, it occurred to me that the large tower rising above the entrance might become a target in the event of an invasion.\n\nExplore the December 2022 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nNow in her sixth year in power, Tsai is Taiwans first female president. We met in a cavernous room decorated with orchids and a grandfather clock. When she entered, she was trailed by a retinue of aidesmostly men. Tsai was brisk, friendly, and businesslike. There was little small talk as we sat across from each other in armchairs. Tsai projected a reserved assurance. I told her that I wanted to know what it was like to face a mounting threat, particularly after the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir PutinChinese President Xi Jinpings self-proclaimed \"best friend\" on the world stage. Tsai or some future Taiwanese leader could soon have the dubious distinction of playing the role of Ukraines Volodymyr Zelensky to Xis Putin.\n\n\"Its real that this thing could happen to us,\" Tsai said. \"So we need to get ourselves ready.\" At another point, she emphasized: \"There is a genuine threat out there. Its not hype.\"\n\nFate has placed Taiwan and Ukraine in similar positions. Both have giant neighbors who once ruled them as imperial possessions. Both have undergone democratic transformations and have thus become an ideological danger to the autocrats who covet their territory. Just as Putin has made the erasure of Ukraines sovereignty central to his political project, Xi has vowed to unify China and Taiwan, by force if necessary. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned in October that China may be working on a \"much faster timeline\" for dealingsomehowwith Taiwan. U.S. military and intelligence leaders have pointed to 2027 as a potential time frame for an invasion, believing that Chinas military modernization will have advanced sufficiently by then.\n\nThe situation requires Tsai to perform a careful balancing act: preparing for war while seeking to avoid it.\n\nTsai is the youngest of 11 children born to the owner of an auto-repair store. She speaks English with a faint trace of a British accentshe did postgraduate work at the London School of Economics. Tsai chooses her words carefully and appears at peace with the role that history has assigned her. She is well aware of the stakes. Taiwans 24 million people have developed their own distinctive and open culture, their own democratic institutions. Her position toward China and the Peoples Liberation Army is defiant: She made clear to me that the Taiwanese will not be bullied, and that Beijing should not misjudge their resolve. \"If the PLA wants to do something drastic, Xi has to weigh the costs,\" Tsai said. \"He has to think twice.\"\n\nRead: How China wants to replace the U.S. order\n\nOf course, a war with China would be enormously lopsided. Tsai noted that the Taiwan legislature recently passed a double-digit increase in the defense budget; Taiwan is now on pace to spend more than $19 billion on defense in 2023. But China spends more than $200 billion a year. This has prompted calls for a shift in Taiwans defense priorities. Instead of building large, conventional hardware (airplanes, tanks, submarines), military experts have urged Taiwan to focus on so-called asymmetric capabilities (anti-ship weapons, surface-to-air missiles, stockpiles of small arms and ammunition), which have served Ukraine well in repelling a larger invader. That, combined with a bigger force of civilian reserves, could make the cost of an invasion too high for China. This approach has earned a nickname in global defense circles: \"the porcupine strategy.\"\n\nFrom Tsais perspective, it is important to remain low-key and unrattled, but also to build up the capacity for Taiwan to defend itself. During Chinas particularly aggressive military exercises in Augustmounted in response to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosis visit to the islandTsai maintained what appeared to be a normal schedule, attending a cultural festival but also visiting with troops. She described to me a resilient calm among younger people. They want to get trained, she said. \"Theyre not trying to escape.\"\n\nIf war comes, a thriving democracy could be extinguished. The United States could be drawn into its first direct military conflict with a nuclear-armed superpower.\n\nChinas threatening behavior, meanwhile, has only escalated. Chinese officials have repeatedly expressed the view that the entirety of the Taiwan Strait already belongs to China. Chinese warplanes regularly violate Taiwans Air Defense Identification Zone. During the military exercises conducted after Pelosis visit, China shot missiles over Taiwan and encircled it with warships in a maneuver that hinted at a future blockadeno small concern for an island that imports nearly all of its energy.\n\nWar is never inevitable, but if it comes, it would have world-changing consequences. A thriving democracy could be extinguished. The Chinese Communist Party could be either emboldened or destabilized. Given Taiwans dominance of the semiconductor industry and the disruption of U.S.-China trade, the global economy could suffer a shock far greater than the one caused by the war in Ukraine. And the United States could be drawn into its first direct military conflict with a nuclear-armed superpower.\n\nTaiwans formal status has been unresolved for decades. Neither independent nor part of the Peoples Republic of China, the citizens of Taiwan have lived within a tenuous status quo constructed by diplomats. Essentially, the arrangement has worked like this: Taiwan doesnt declare independence, China doesnt invade, and the U.S. doesnt say definitively whether it would enter a conflict should one occur.\n\nThe type of support that Taiwan now needsto deter a conflict or to defend itself if conflict comesis a subject of growing debate in Taipei and Washington. The last time there was a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait was in 1995, ahead of Taiwans first democratic presidential election. China test-fired ballistic missiles and conducted rehearsals for an amphibious invasion. The U.S. countered by sending an aircraft-carrier group and other naval assets to the region, demonstrating its overwhelming military advantage. Things have changed since then. China now has the worlds largest navy, with more than 350 ships and submarines. Its rocket force maintains the worlds largest arsenal of land-based missiles, which would feature in any war with Taiwan.\n\nAdmiral Lee Hsi-ming, who was chief of Taiwans General Staff from 2017 to 2019, has championed the shift to asymmetric capabilities and has emerged as a Cassandra-like figure in his warnings that Taiwan is not preparing fast enough. His rigid military manner is animated by a blunt sense of urgency. Like officials I spoke with who are still in government, Lee saw the Chinese response to the Pelosi visit as another step in Beijings pursuit of a \"new normal.\" On more than one occasion China has pushed beyond the median line in the waters between Taiwan and China. Its flights into Taiwans air-defense zone have escalated. China is eating away at Taiwans sovereignty, de facto claiming its airspace and waters. Several analysts have used the phrase boiling the frog to describe Beijings Taiwan strategy.\n\nRead: Chinas mistakes can be Americas gain\n\nThis new normal presents challenges to both Taiwan and the United States. Chinas conventional firepower could overwhelm Taiwans air and naval defensesits capacity to keep the enemy at a distance. China could also move quickly to deny the U.S. access to the island, cutting it off from the outside world by sea and air. Politically, Lee said, the message from China to the U.S. and Taiwan is simple: \"I can do whatever I want in Taiwan, and theres nothing the U.S. can do about it.\" This message came across unequivocally in a white paper that Beijing released in August. The Cliffs Notes version of this lengthy document can be surmised from the first three section headings: \"I. Taiwan Is Part of ChinaThis Is an Indisputable Fact,\" \"II. Resolute Efforts of the CPC to Realize Chinas Complete Reunification,\" and \"III. Chinas Complete Reunification Is a Process That Cannot Be Halted.\"\n\nLee points to two possible scenarios. The first is a coercive approach in which China encircles and pressures Taiwanperhaps even seizing outlying islands and engaging in missile strikes. The second is a full-scale invasion. Given that China would likely suffer the same international consequences for conducting a war of attrition as it would for mounting an outright invasion, Lee worries that Beijing might decide the invasion scenario makes more sense. Lee has grown frustrated by Taiwans continued procurement of large weapons systems, such as airplanes and ships. He argues that it is not worth trying to keep up with Chinas conventional superiority. To take just one example: In the event of a war, Chinese missiles could destroy Taiwans runways, rendering expensive fighter jets useless.\n\n\"The purpose is to make China believe that if you want to invade Taiwan, you will suffer huge losses,\" said Admiral Lee Hsi-ming. \"And if you still invade Taiwan, you will not be able to succeed.\"\n\nYou may not be able to stop an invasion, Lee says, but you can stop China from subjugating Taiwan. This entails denying China the ability to control the battle space. The Chinese havent fought a war in several decades, and Taiwan has geographic advantagesincluding ample mountains and few beaches suitable for amphibious operations. Anti-ship missiles, anti-tank weapons, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, drones, long-range artillery, and small arms could wreak havoc on an invading force, and disrupt the supply chains necessary to sustain an occupation. Lee also argues that Taiwans civilian population should be organized into a trained Territorial Defense Force, so that any attempted occupation would be met by the broadest possible resistance. \"As long as China fails, Taiwan wins the war,\" Lee explained.\n\nBen Rhodes: We have reached a hinge of history\n\nThe utility of this approach has become clearer after Russias calamitous \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. \"The purpose is to make China believe that if you want to invade Taiwan, you will suffer huge losses,\" Lee said. \"And if you still invade Taiwan, you will not be able to succeed.\" This will require a continued shift in Taiwans own defense doctrine. That shift has been encouraged by the Biden administration and was evident in Septembers $1.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which included a substantial number of anti-ship Harpoon missiles and Sidewinder surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. But as Lee sees it, the pace must quicken. \"Taiwan needs a strategic paradigm shift,\" he told me.\n\nIn her own deliberate and incremental fashion, Tsai has directed some defense spending in this direction and expressed support for training civilians in nonmilitary skills such as \"community defense, first aid, and information awareness.\" Given that Taiwans largest destination for trade and investment is China, Tsai is also working to diversify Taiwans economy to make it less reliant on that market, launching new trade talks with the United States and pursuing trade and investment in Southeast Asia. She has created a Ministry of Digital Affairs and bolstered cyberdefenses to respond to constant Chinese hacking and disinformation campaigns. As a pointed reminder, she speaks openly about the islands dominance in advanced semiconductorsTaiwan manufactures 90 percent of themwhich she calls a \"silicon shield.\" A war that curbed supply could prove highly disruptive for Beijingperhaps too disruptive. Tsais foreign policy has also courted other democracies, seeking friends with similar values.\n\nHow did we get to this point? The origin story of Taiwan most familiar to Americans begins in 1949, when Chiang Kai-sheks nationalist forces, locked for years in a civil war with Mao Zedongs Communists, were defeated. Along with much of his remaining army, Chiang fled to Taiwan and set up a government-in-exile called the Republic of China. That government was recognized by the United States. But within a few years of Richard Nixons 1972 Cold War opening to Beijing, the U.S. formally switched diplomatic recognition to the Peoples Republic. Ever since, Taiwans status has been cloaked in ambiguity. The U.S. acknowledges Beijings claim to Taiwan without recognizing its sovereignty over the island. To help deter a Chinese effort to seize Taiwan by force, the U.S. has pledged to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nFrom the January 1980 issue: Taiwan, an unmarried country\n\nThat origin story explains Taiwans curious geopolitical status, but it leaves a lot out. When Chiang fled to Taiwanwith roughly 2 million Chinese from the mainlandthere were some 6 million people already living on an island that was just emerging from 50 years of Japanese rule. Most of the people living on the island when Chiang arrived could claim roots in Taiwan going back hundreds of years. They had their own languages and culture. So too did the islands many Indigenous groups, such as the Amis, the Atayal, and the Paiwan. To subjugate the island, Chiang killed and imprisoned tens of thousands over decadesa period known as the White Terror. He set up a military dictatorship under the leadership of his Chinese nationalist Kuomintang Party (KMT) and, from this offshore platform, vowed to reclaim mainland China.\n\nIllustration by Cristiana Couceiro.

With its broad boulevards, glass towers, military monuments, narrow side streets, night markets, and ample signs in English, Taipei today presents an ambience of blended cultures: Chinese, Japanese, Western, and distinctly Taiwanese. Bubble tea, a Taiwanese invention, is everywhere. But consider what it was like to grow up in the shadow of Taiwans postwar history, and you can better understand the profound ways in which younger generations have been remaking the islands politics and identity.\n\nEmily Y. Wu is a professional podcaster who blends a focus on youth culture with an urgent concern for Taiwans political present. (One of her shows is called Metalhead Politics.) She is among dozens of Taiwanese I spoke with during the past year, first on Zoom, then in person in Taipei. Wu was born under KMT martial law in 1984. Her family did not come over with Chiang; they had lived in Taiwan for generations. \"Chiang Kai-shek brought China over,\" she told me. \"I grew up always knowing that there was this alternate history: It was Taiwanese history, which was not taught in school.\" Students were taught Chinese history and geography under the presumption that the KMT would one day govern China again. Mandarin was spoken in class, and speaking Taiwanese was discouraged. Wu recalled Lesson 9 of her childhood textbook: \" Hello teachers, hello students, we are Chinese! \"\n\nBut a movement for democracy was building. \"We grew up hearing these names, knowing that there was a group of activists, scholars, lawyers that tried to imagine a free Taiwan,\" Wu explained. Many of those people were members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which currently governs Taiwan. In 1987, the KMT lifted nearly 40 years of martial law. Wus political consciousness was shaped by the protests, marches, and hunger strikes that led to Taiwans first true presidential election, in 1996.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, Taiwan was becoming ever more democraticand ever more Taiwanese. The school curriculum changed: Taiwans distinct history was taught, as were Taiwanese languages. Taiwan also began to celebrate its Indigenous population. After the election of President Ma Ying-jeou, in 2008, links of trade, investment, and travel helped reduce tensions with China. Ma was from the KMT, and the partys Chinese heritage and its ties to Taiwans business elite eased the way to dtente with Beijing. But many Taiwanese, particularly the young, feared that forging too close a connection could ultimately give Beijing leverage over Taiwan. In 2014, in what became known as \"the Sunflower Movement,\" named for the flower that served as a symbol of hope, students occupied the Taiwan legislature to oppose a free-trade agreement with China. After a tense standoff, they succeeded in stopping the deal. They also helped propel a political wave that in 2016 brought the election of the DPPs Tsai Ing-wen as president.\n\nAs Taiwan was becoming more democratic, China was becoming more autocratic. And as Taiwan was becoming more Taiwanese, China was becoming more fervently nationalist. After the ascent of Xi Jinping to the head of the Communist Party, in 2012, Beijing shifted from incentives to coercion. Xis government proved adept at bullying companies and entire countries to stop doing business in Taiwan and to recognize Chinas narrative of sovereignty. Xi also began escalating crackdowns on Chinas peripheryin Xinjiang province and in Hong Kong.\n\nBen Rhodes: The path to autocracy\n\nWhen Xi first took power, Emily Wu was living in Beijing. \"I felt the tightening of the space that Taiwan was allowed to navigate,\" she recalled. \"It was all around meevery move that Xi Jinping was making. Youre sitting in China and Im like, How can I sit here while looking at what is happening and not being able to do anything about it? \" Wu moved back to Taiwan and started a company named Ghost Island Media, picking up on a bit of local black humor that captures Taiwans ambiguous status. Through podcasts in Mandarin and English, Ghost Island offers a window into the perilous irony of Taiwans existence: The more successful the Taiwanese are in building their own democracy, the more endangered they are by a China that feels this ghost island eluding its grasp.\n\nDuring one of our conversations, I used the term status quo, and Wu asked me what I thought it meant. \"You are not independent, but China has not invaded your country,\" I replied. Wu paused for a moment, and then said, \"I always thought the idea of status quo is really interesting, because in the American context that is what it means. But the idea of it here is: There is no need to declare independence, because we are already independent. This country functions like an independent nation, but someone else says it is not.\" Recent polling suggests that fewer than 5 percent of people in Taiwan identify as \"only Chinese.\"\n\nFor decades, China and Taiwan have conducted intermittent negotiations. From Chinas perspective, the starting point for any dialogue must be the so-called 1992 Consensus. This refers to the outcome of meetings between Chinese and KMT officials 30 years ago, an outcome that represents anything but consensus. To the Chinese Communist Party, the consensus is that there is one China, and the government in Beijing is the sole legitimate authority. To the KMT, the consensus is that there is one China, but the Republic of China in Taiwan is the legitimate government. To the DPP, there is no consensus, only a fraught political reality to be managed. Past Chinese leaders tolerated differing interpretations, but that changed with Xi. Any negotiations, Xi insists, can only address the terms under which Taiwan submits to the sovereignty of the Peoples Republic. Tsai has not been willing to enter negotiations on those terms.\n\nChina proposes a \"one country, two systems\" regime, in which Taiwan becomes a formal part of China but maintains an autonomous political system. There is one big problem with this proposal: Hong Kong. In 1997, in accordance with a formal agreement between the United Kingdom and China, Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty under a similar one-country-two-systems formula. The agreement stipulated that Hong Kong would be able to maintain its own distinct political, economic, and legal framework for 50 years. The deal seemed to work at first. But as China became more powerful and prosperous, it encroached upon life in Hong Kong. Media outlets started to be bought up by Chinese tycoons. Economic advancement became contingent on not crossing political lines. Large numbers of Mandarin speakers from the mainland started moving into Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong. The school curriculum shifted in the direction of the Communist Partys point of view. It was precisely the kind of outcome that the Sunflower Movement had resisted in Taiwan.\n\nIn 2019, Hong Kong authorities sought to appease Beijing by introducing a law that allowed residents of Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland Chinaremoving a guardrail around the citys legal status. Protests exploded and continued for months. Then, in 2020, several \"national-security laws\" were passed giving the authorities broad powers to crush dissent. Activists were rounded up. Independent media were shut down. One country, two systems was dead. The fate of Hong Kong has had a profound impact on Taiwan. \"When China moves in, the freedom is gone,\" President Tsai told me. \"People in Taiwan got a very strong message.\"\n\nMin-yen Chiang certainly got the message. As a high-school student in Taiwan, he joined the Sunflower Movement. When he went to Hong Kong for university, he embraced the 2014 \"Umbrella Movement,\" whose members occupied Hong Kongs central business district for 79 days, demanding free and fair elections. In 2019, after graduation, Chiang joined the protests in Hong Kong. He learned firsthand what happened next.\n\nI met with Chiang at the Taipei office of Flow HK, a magazine that focuses on Hong Kongs movement for democracy. It was a hot day, soupy with humidity, but Chiang switched on a small air conditioner only after we were settled in a spartan conference room. On one wall was a poster that read, in Chinese characters, \"Protect Taiwan, Resist China, Support Hong Kong.\" Chiang spoke softly but with assurance as he described his efforts to change Taiwans laws in order to better protect refugees. \"When we are supporting Hong Kong,\" he said, \"we are thinking about how to resist China.\"\n\nRead: The lessons Taiwan is learning from Ukraine\n\nIn swallowing Hong Kong, Xi may have made it impossible to repeat the same playbook with Taiwan. But the fate of Ukraine has shown that a bullying neighbor has more extreme options. At the beginning of Russias war, Chiang organized a press conference with the small Ukrainian population in Taipei. \"They always tell me that we have prepared for this war for at least eight years, since 2014,\" he said, referring to the initial Russian invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. \"I dont think Taiwanese young people can confidently say that.\" But more and more leaders in civic organizations and the press are learning how to speak English so they can communicate better with the outside world. \"Ukraine inspired the Taiwanese society a lot, including how Zelensky told their story,\" Chiang said. He was almost matter-of-fact when he told me, \"I would say war between China and Taiwan will definitely happen. We want to win.\"\n\nThe best outcome for Taiwan would be avoiding a war and maintaining the ambiguous status quo. That requires immense discipline, both in presidential statements and in ordinary interactions with the wider world.\n\nWhen I landed in Taipei, people in spacesuit-style medical uniforms directed bleary-eyed travelers to a series of stations that had to be navigated before entering the country. Early in the pandemic, Chinese propaganda constantly attacked Tsais response. Mocking the islands reliance on America, Chinese memes suggested that the U.S. was vaccinating pets before offering shots to Taiwan. I scanned a QR code to access my preflight forms and was notified that I needed a Taiwanese phone so the police could ensure I maintained three days of quarantine. At a series of tables, young health workers explained the process of inserting SIM cards into phones. An American next to me became frustrated. But the Taiwanese woman behind the counter was patient and kind, explainingagain and againhow it was done.\n\nThis was a snapshot of Taiwans self-control. To permit widespread COVID infections would validate Beijings brutal information war against Taiwandespite the fact that Beijings stubborn \"zero COVID\" policy has backfired on its own economy and society. To be anything less than unfailingly polite to visitors could undermine the relationships that Taiwan is relentlessly trying to build. I was reminded of a comment that Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwans representative in Washington, made to me: \"We have to be the perfect student in the class to protect ourselves from bullying and help us make friends.\"\n\nPresident Tsai plays that part well. She was born to humble circumstances, and her family has deep roots in Taiwan. Indeed, her paternal grandmother is descended from one of the islands Indigenous tribes, the Paiwan. Tsai earned a law degree and was a law-school professor for a time. Entering public life, she served in a variety of government posts on trade and relations with China before joining the DPP in 2004. She steadied the party after corruption scandals and led it to victory following a narrow loss in the 2012 presidential election. Her campaigns have featured her two cats, Think Think and Ah Tsai.\n\nTsai met with me after receiving yet another U.S. congressional delegationTaiwan is becoming a must-stop for members of both parties trying to assert their national-security bona fides. A DPP administration makes for an enigmatic interlocutor. In some ways, the party is more comfortable with Republican China hawks than with Democrats wary of projecting American power. Yet the party is also progressive. Tsai formally apologized to Indigenous groups for centuries of mistreatment; she pledged to have their languages taught in schools and to honor Indigenous cultures. Tsais government was the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Announcing her support for marriage equality, Tsai said, \"Let everyone be able to freely love and pursue happiness.\" Whether American visitors represent the right or left, every delegation gets presidential attention.\n\nIn our conversation, Tsai talked about what she had learned from Ukraine. One lesson is simply the need for international supportto defend itself or, better, to avoid a war in the first place. \"The Western countries, particularly the U.S., are helping Ukraine. What we see from the Ukraine war is Western countries get together and help Ukraine to fight.\" Because Taiwan is an island, it will be difficult to resupply in the event of hostilities; Taiwan needs support now. Even though the U.S. didnt enter the war after Russias invasion, it did offer Ukraine essential weapons, supplies, and budgetary assistance. \"These people do help others,\" Tsai said, referring to the West as if speaking to her own citizens.\n\nIllustration by Cristiana Couceiro. Sources: Travel Wild / Alamy; PeterHermesFurian / Getty.\n\nAnother lesson of Ukraine is the importance of national character. Outside support, Tsai emphasized, depends on qualities only Taiwan can provide. \"You need to have good leadership,\" she said, \"but more important is the peoples determination to defend themselves, and the Ukrainian people showed that.\"\n\nSuch determination is essential to the kind of paradigm shift Admiral Lee has advocated. It is a daunting prospect. The more you plan to resist an invasion, the more you risk panicking the population and the more challenges you realize youll have to face. Small- and mobile-weapons systems have to be secured against attack by Chinese missiles. Plans must be put in place to ensure that the government can communicate with its people if standard forms of communication are disrupted. The government must also prioritize crucial infrastructure, defend against cyberattacks, stockpile food and water, and decentralize the electricity grid. Instead of creating a Territorial Defense Force, thus far the Tsai administration has opted to bolster its reserve forces; the military has issued a survival handbook on civil defense in case of war.\n\nFrom the September 2019 issue: Ben Rhodes on Aung San Suu Kyi and the future of Myanmar\n\nTaiwan has term limits, preventing President Tsai from running again. Taiwans voters will have an important decision to make in 2024. The opposition KMT party is staking out its position with care. The partys representative to the United States, an amiable academic and veteran diplomat named Alex Huang, told me that the KMT was more oriented to the U.S. relationship than it had been at times in the past, but it still supports dialogue with China. Instead of the ambitious trade agreements of the Ma Ying-jeou years, Huang said engagement should focus on threat reduction and crisis management. Implicit in his argument was the notion that inflaming China by severing ties and fully embracing the United States could put Taiwans very existence at riskextinguishing both the DPPs vision of a de facto independent Taiwan and the KMTs hope for some future conciliation with a changed China. For their part, members of the DPPand many young Taiwaneseworry that the KMT might turn Taiwan into a second Hong Kong.\n\nHanging over all of this is the role of the United States. As one Taiwanese expert pointedly asked me: \"We can make ourselves a porcupine, but what are you going to do?\"\n\nOn four separate occasions, President Joe Biden has said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. Each time, the White House put out a follow-up statement saying that U.S. policy had not in fact changed.\n\nThis U.S. policy is known as \"strategic ambiguity.\" The U.S. has no mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, as it does with NATO allies and countries like Japan and South Korea. For decades, there has been bipartisan consensus that declaring a commitment to defend Taiwan could make a war more likely: Taiwan could trigger a conflict by declaring independence, or China could feel compelled to enforce its \"One China\" red line. By remaining inscrutable, Washington forces China to consider the likelihood of the U.S. coming to Taiwans defense, even as Washington accepts the current status quo. Bidens statements, however, have not been ambiguous and stand in contrast to his statements before the Russian invasion of Ukraine that the U.S. would not intervene directly.\n\nThe Biden administration has been more cautious in practice than in rhetoric. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently advanced the bipartisan Taiwan Policy Act, which goes beyond authorizing arms sales to financing arms sales with money from American taxpayers. But the administration quietly lobbied to remove provisions that would have been seen by Beijing as moving in the direction of diplomatic recognitionsuch as making the position of the senior American diplomat in Taipei a job that requires Senate confirmation, as ambassadorships do. The administration has also resisted the Taiwan Policy Acts call to ramp up training and joint military exercises.\n\nLike President Tsai, the Biden administration is trying to walk a line, better preparing Taiwan while not unnecessarily provoking China. That requires some guesswork about what lessons China may have drawn from Ukraine. Will Xi see Ukraines military success as a warning against invading a neighbor that is building up asymmetric capabilities? Or will he decide he has to invade before Taiwan is sufficiently armed and trained?\n\nAmerican politics has its own anti-China momentum. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech earlier this year in Taipei arguing that the U.S. should formally recognize Taiwan as a nation-state. But performative rhetoric and symbolic gestures that play well to domestic political constituencies suggest a clarity that does not exist. Would the U.S. risk the biggest naval battle since World War II to break a Chinese blockade? Would the U.S. attack an invading Chinese force knowing that U.S. military personnel in Japan, Guam, and possibly Hawaii are within range of Chinese rockets? Would the American people really support a war with the worlds most populous country in order to defend Taiwan?\n\nPerhaps for this reason, everyone I spoke with in Taiwan focused more on how the U.S. can help prepare Taiwan than on what the U.S. would do in a conflict. As war has grown more likely, Taiwanese attitudes have shifted too. A poll taken after the invasion of Ukraine showed that the number of people in Taiwan who expect the U.S. to send troops in the event of war fell from 57 to 40 percent, while 73 percent said they would fight to defend themselves. Seeing the difference that eight years of training made for Ukraine, many believe that increased training should be quietly pursued. Given that the U.S. does have a formal agreement to help prepare Taiwan to defend itself, training the Taiwanese would be a logical response and consistent with existing U.S. commitments. In contrast, joint military exercises would suggest a role for the U.S. military that extends beyond preparing Taiwan to defend itself.\n\nThe U.S. can also take nonmilitary steps. It should make every effort to deepen and regularize diplomatic openings with China on Taiwanto avoid an incident that could escalate, and to manage tensions. The U.S. can also expand its trade relationship with Taiwan to make it less vulnerable to Chinese coercion and more embedded in secure supply chains. As the U.S. fosters its own semiconductor industry, it can partner with Taipei to avoid undercutting Taiwans. The U.S. can work diplomatically to increase Taiwans cooperation with other democracies, including on practical issues where Taiwan has expertisepublic health, cybersecurity, and combatting disinformation. The U.S. and other democracies can also specify to China the far-reaching economic consequencesincluding sanctionsthat would be triggered by any effort to take Taiwan by force.\n\n\"What I want to achieve is to make Taiwan more resilient in economic and military terms,\" President Tsai told me.\n\nMuch of this is already on the agenda for Biden and the Tsai administration. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, in particular, has articulated the need for Taiwan to counter its diplomatic isolation by emphasizing democracy. He has made inroads in Europe, where some countries have shown a willingness to step up engagement with Taiwan. \"This is especially so for Central and Eastern European countries,\" he told me. \"They were ruled by Communists and understand the difficulties of the threat from an authoritarian country.\" Lithuania, for instance, weathered a furious Chinese response after it allowed Taiwan to open an office in its capital, Vilnius. This may seem like a small step, but it boosts morale in Taiwan. As Hsiao Bi-khim told me, \"If you tell people on the streets of Taiwan that you are Lithuanian, you will be treated with great admiration.\"\n\nStill, these small victories only point up the scale of the challenge. Wu himself has used the term cognitive warfare to describe the comprehensive nature of Chinas pressure on Taiwan. \"They use missiles, air, ships, disinformation, cyberattacks, and economic coercion,\" he told me. As a warning sign, China has banned hundreds of exported products from Taiwan. \"They claimed that our mangoes tested positive for COVID,\" Wu said. \"I dont think you can give a mango a PCR.\" Thanks to Chinese pressure, the number of countries that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan has fallen to a new low of 14. In the 2019 trailer for Top Gun: Maverick, the Taiwanese flag that was on Tom Cruises flight jacket in the first film was removed to suit Chinese tastes. (It was later restored; the movie was never released in China.)\n\nI asked Wu, who was educated at Ohio State, how he would make the case to a bunch of college-football fans at a tailgate for why they should care about Taiwan. After declaring himself a Buckeye, he paused, sensing the import of the exercise. First, he noted, \"if theres a Chinese invasion, the economic impact is going to be more serious than Ukraine.\"\n\nMore existential, though, is what could happen after a Chinese invasion. If China takes Taiwan, Wu suggested that the Chinese Communist Partys ambitions could extend to the East China Sea, threatening Japan; to the South China Sea, where China has built militarized islands and claims an entire body of water bordering several nations; to the Indian Ocean, where China is expanding influence and could establish military bases; and to the Pacific Ocean, where China is working to establish security pacts with island nations. In a world with nationalist-strongman politics ascendant on nearly every continent, Wus presentation was at once a dire and plausible picture of the stakes for geopolitics as well as human freedom. \"If we allow China to continue to expand,\" Wu told me, \"then democracies will be in danger.\"\n\nOn one of my last nights in Taipei, I met with a woman in her early 30s named Billion Lee who helps run Cofacts, an organization that fact-checks disinformation and promotes digital literacy. Relying on a crowdsourced network of more than 2,000 volunteers, Cofacts has done nearly 90,000 fact-checks, mostly on the ubiquitous Taiwanese social-media platform Line. I asked her about Beijing-driven narratives that accompanied the invasion of Ukraine, and they sounded conspicuously similar to those emanating from Moscow. As bombs began falling on Ukraine, the people of Taiwan were bombarded by Chinese-fueled disinformation campaigns: The U.S. was developing biological weapons in Ukraine. Taiwan will be next if they keep buying weapons from America. These overlapped with narratives Id heard about from other Taiwanese: Afghanistan showed that Americans dont keep their promises. The Americans wont send troops to defend white people in Ukraine, so they will never send them to defend you. Lee noted that her generation had developed antibodies to such campaigns, but China was focusing on younger demographics as wellteenagers and preteensthrough Chinese apps like TikTok.\n\nAfter a quick dinner of soba noodles, we walked a short distance to a small alley off a bustling main boulevard and met Johnson Liang, a young man with shoulder-length hair and round glasses that made him look like a Taiwanese John Lennon. Liang took out a large metal key to open the door to a shared workspace. We removed our shoes and walked into a back conference room. Lee passed out moon cakes and Liang connected his laptop to a projector that showed his screen on a bare wall.\n\nThe two of them explained that they were developing a tool that could enable fact-checkers to compare shared images and transcripts with similar content online, thus making it easier to do the painstaking work of sorting fact from falsehood. As they went about their work, I scrolled through the latest fact-checks. One involved a lengthy speech that was alleged to have been transcribed from a private recording of French President Emmanuel Macron speaking with diplomats in Paris and blaming the U.S. for all of the trouble in the world. \"We must admit that China and Russia have achieved great success over the years under different leadership styles,\" Macron supposedly said. (The speech was labeled a falsehood.) Another post, also flagged as false, talked about how the U.S. has been trying to turn \"blue\" (the KMT) and \"green\" (the DPP) against each other: \"The ultimate goal is to ask Taiwan to die to the last man.\"\n\nI sat there reading message after message, all posted in closed chat rooms, meant to bend Taiwanese minds to Beijings worldview. The meanings of buzzwords like cognitive warfare and resilience came into sharper focus. Facing the seemingly bottomless resources of a massive totalitarian state, here were two young people working for free on a Wednesday night, quietly insisting on the notion that there is indeed such a thing as objective reality.\n\nI walked out into Taipei streets filled with people and a pulsing array of advertising. Commuters whod worked late streamed onto the elevated metro. Packs of teenagers laughed on street corners. All totally ordinary. And yet, to preserve this, Taiwan has to find some mix of the approaches that Id heard about: preparing for a war while avoiding it; talking to China without being coerced by it; drawing closer to the U.S. without being reduced to a chess piece on the board of a great game; tending to a young democracy without letting divisions weaken it; asserting a unique identity without becoming an independent country.\n\nWhen I got back to my hotel, I had to descend four levels into the parking garage to enterthe remnant of a COVID protocoland was reminded of something that Emily Wu had told me. Taiwan conducts annual air-raid drills. They were suspended for the past few years, owing to the pandemic, but resumed this summer. And now, Wu said, people take them more seriously. Underground parking garages were seen as ideal places to take shelter. I looked at the largely deserted expanse of parking spaces around me, a familiar sight now cast in a different light.\n\n\"What I want to achieve is to make Taiwan more resilient in economic and military terms,\" Tsai had told me. Its possible to look at this kind of gradual marshaling of society with trepidation. Coupled with the lack of a diplomatic opening to China, theres a momentum that risks pulling in the direction of conflict. But in Tsais attitude, I sensed that resilience serves many purposes. A society that embeds digital literacy and emergency preparedness among its citizens is stronger, just as an economy that isnt overly reliant on the giant market next door will grow on a broader foundation. Even the effort to build a more progressive democracy comes into play, both in terms of investing domestic constituencies in the government and in forging friendships with democracies abroad.\n\nIn the end, Tsais agenda is born of necessity. \"When were strong, resilient, trustworthy, and a good partner,\" Tsai said, \"people will see our values. That makes us worthy of support.\"\n\nThe last question I asked President Tsai was whether she had ever wished to govern a normal country with normal problems. She appeared to consider the notion, but allowed herself to betray no emotion. \"We may be unfortunate to have a big neighbor next door,\" she said. \"But that makes us stronger.\"",

With many people having fled the city during the Russian occupation, the city streets were thinly populated. Many of the few people venturing out Sunday carried yellow and blue flags. On the square, people lined up to ask soldiers to autograph their flags and rewarded them with hugs. Some wept.\n\nMore bleakly, Kherson is also without electricity or running water, and food and medical supplies are short. Residents said Russian troops plundered the city, carting away loot as they withdrew last week. They also wrecked key public infrastructure before retreating across the wide Dnieper River to its east bank. One Ukrainian official described the situation in Kherson as \"a humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nWATCH: Russian attacks on energy infrastructure leaves Ukraine in dark as winter approaches\n\n\"I dont understand what kind of people this is. I dont know why they did it,\" said resident Yevhen Teliezhenko, draped in a Ukrainian flag.\n\nStill, he said, \"it became easier to breathe\" once the Russians had gone.\n\n\"There is no better holiday than whats happening now,\" he declared.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the demining of critical infrastructure is under way in the city. Reconnecting the electricity supply is the priority, with gas supplies already assured, Kherson regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said.\n\nThe Russian pullout marked a triumphant milestone in Ukraines pushback against Moscows invasion almost nine months ago. In the past two months, Ukraines military claimed to have retaken dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to keep up the pressure on Russian forces, reassuring the people in Ukrainian cities and villages that are still under occupation.\n\n\"We dont forget anyone; we wont leave anyone,\" he said.\n\nUkraines retaking of Kherson was a significant setback for the Kremlin and the latest in a series of battlefield embarrassments. It came some six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed the Kherson region and three other provinces in southern and eastern Ukraine in breach of international law and declared them Russian territory.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted comments Sunday by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who described the turnaround in Kherson as \"an extraordinary victory\" for Ukraine and \"quite a remarkable thing.\"\n\nThe reversal came despite Putins recent partial mobilization of reservists, raising troop numbers by some 300,000. That has been hard for the Russian military to digest.\n\nWATCH: Russians flee to neighboring countries to avoid fighting in Putins war against Ukraine\n\n\"Russian military leadership is trying and largely failing to integrate combat forces drawn from many different organizations and of many different types and levels of skill and equipment into a more cohesive fighting force in Ukraine,\" commented the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank that tracks the conflict\n\nBritish Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the Kremlin will be \"worried\" by the loss of Kherson but warned against underestimating Moscow. \"If they need more cannon fodder, that is what theyll be doing,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian police called on residents to help identify collaborators with Russian forces. Ukrainian police officers returned to the city Saturday, along with public broadcasting services. The national police chief of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said about 200 officers were at work in the city, setting up checkpoints and documenting evidence of possible war crimes.\n\nREAD MORE: Ukrainian police, broadcast services return to long-occupied Kherson after Russian withdrawal\n\nIn what could perhaps be the next district to fall in Ukraines march on territory annexed by Moscow, the Russian-appointed administration of the Kakhovka district, east of the city of Kherson, announced Saturday it was evacuating its employees.\n\n\"Today, the administration is the No. 1 target for Ukrainian attacks,\" said the Moscow-installed leader of Kakhovka, Pavel Filipchuk. \"We, as an authority, are moving to a safer territory, from where we will lead the district.\"\n\nKakhovka is located on the east bank of the Dnieper River, upstream of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station.\n\nJohn Leicester contributed to this story from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

One cafe was open thanks to a generator, but other stores, including a supermarket, and the apartment buildings had no power.\n\nWithout power, everything takes much longer just as the temperatures are beginning to drop. There are lines for cash machines, which only work when the power is on, and at stores and welfare centers that provide basic grocery supplies to those in greatest need.\n\nThe power interruptions have led to spontaneous street markets appearing, even though they are unlicensed.\n\nThe people of Kyiv are improvising and adapting as they have for much of this year, but without some relief from the missile attacks, many may choose to leave the city and hunker down for the winter months around a wood-burning stove.\n\nOn Sunday Vitali Klitschko, Kyivs mayor, said the city is preparing for worst-case scenarios in the event of further Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, which could potentially leave it without any power or water. He said: \"Our enemies are doing everything to keep the city without heat, electricity, and water supply, and in general, they want us all to die.\"\n\nCNN has spoken to some of the citys residents about the harsh realities that lie ahead, among them 21-year-old coffee shop barista, Anna Ermantraut.\n\nBarista Anna Ermantraut, 21, would move to a nearby village if Kyiv is evacuated. Denis Lapin/CNN\n\nWhen she arrived for work at 8.30 a.m. on Monday, there was no electricity. She said she eventually started work two hours later but at 12 p.m. the power went out again.\n\nErmantraut said the coffee shops earnings had more than halved and she could no longer sell many cakes because the refrigerators were off so frequently.\n\nLife is not much better at home, she told CNN. When the electricity goes there, she also loses the water supply.\n\nErmantraut said she had begun thinking about what to do if the power situation further deteriorates and Kyiv is evacuated. She said she planned to move to a house in a nearby village where there is a stove that runs on firewood and a well with water.\n\nWhen CNN met 70-year-old pensioner Lubov Mironenko she had been waiting in line for five hours at a welfare center for grocery supplies. The persistent outages have made it difficult to survive, she said.\n\nMarya Litvinchuk, 29, a hairdresser, said the additional power cuts, in addition to the three scheduled every day, have worsened an already difficult situation.\n\nWhen the power was cut off according to a schedule, \"you could plan to work, but still, working time was reduced by half.\" Of course, that meant that \"earnings were also cut by half.\"\n\nIn a bid to keep operating, she ordered special lights that run on batteries and bought a generator for $1,000 even though the average price of a haircut is just $6. There was then more bad news as she discovered that she had been scammed and the generator didnt work. She now has to take electric clippers home to recharge them overnight.\n\nHairdresser Marya Litvinchuk was scammed out of $1,000 for a faulty generator. Denis Lapin/CNN\n\nLike Ermantraut, she plans to move to the countryside to stay with relatives if Kyiv is evacuated.\n\nYuriy Pogulay, 39, is also suffering financially. Not so long ago the small cafe that Pogulay jointly owns operated between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. they now struggle to stay open for more than three hours.\n\nHe told CNN that revenue had dropped significantly and that they cannot store food for long as they have tried to minimize using the refrigerator.\n\n\"I ordered a generator, but I dont know when it will arrive,\" he said.\n\nPogulay said the business was financially squeezed. \"With the generator my costs will increase, but I cant raise prices because the economic situation of people has worsened.\"\n\nThe World Bank has forecast that the Ukrainian economy may contract by 40% or more this year because of the conflict.\n\nMusician Anton Kargatov has nowhere else to go. Denis Lapin/CNN\n\nOne man who has suffered less than most is Anton Kargatov, a 36-year-old musician.\n\n\"I play music outdoors, so I dont need electricity,\" said Kargatov, who told CNN he has a sleeping bag and a powerbank at home. \"If Kyiv is evacuated, Im not going anywhere. Theres a well with water not far from my house. And in the backyard I can cook food over a fire. I dont have anywhere else to go.\"\n\nVictoria Storozh works at a pizzeria in downtown Kyiv; the business suffers fewer power cuts than some as it is located in an area close to government buildings. Even so, she said: \"My husband and I are ready in case we all have to evacuate, we have a stock of firewood and water at our dacha in the Kyiv region. We will live through the hard times there.\"\n\nSerhey Kizilov, 23, is a rehabilitation coach who works out of a basement gym. Lighting is just one of the issues he faces, he told CNN.\n\n\"Our whole sewage system depends on pumps running on electricity. Also our ventilation system,\" he said. \"Even if we can make the rooms light when there is no electricity, we cant do anything about the sewage and ventilation.\n\n\"My income suffers also, because there are fewer people in the hall not everyone wants to practice in such conditions.\"",

The Pentagon announced a new package of $400 million in security assistance on Friday. Credit... Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON The Defense Department is setting up a new command to oversee how the United States and its allies train and equip the Ukrainian military, the Pentagon announced on Friday along with a new package of $400 million in security assistance.\n\nThe Pentagons commitment to supplying Ukraine with weaponry and the new command are clear signals that the United States expects the threat from Russia to Ukraine and its neighbors to persist for many years, current and former senior U.S. officials said.\n\nThe command will \"ensure we are postured to continue supporting Ukraine over the long term,\" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters at a news briefing. \"We remain committed to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\"\n\nIn the military, a command is a focused organization dedicated to a particular geographical or strategic area. The new command, called the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, or SAG-U, will based in Germany and within the structure of the Pentagons European Command. With a staff of about 300 people, it will be focused on one mission: to help train and equip Ukraines military.\n\nThe new command will streamline a training and assistance system that was created on the fly after the Russian invasion in February. The Times reported in September that the new structure was in the works.\n\nThe revamped assistance program will be led by a high-ranking general who will replace Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, the head of the Armys 18th Airborne Corps, who has coordinated much of the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine from behind the scenes over the past several months.\n\nA leading candidate to take over the new position is Lt. Gen. Antonio A. Aguto, Jr., the head of the First U.S. Army headquarters, located at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, military officials said.\n\nThe additional $400 million in security assistance includes, for the first time, funding to refurbish 45 tanks from the Czech Republic, which will start arriving in Ukraine by the end of December, Ms. Singh said. The funding also will go to contracts for 1,100 Phoenix Ghost drones and an additional 40 riverine boats.\n\nThe latest announcement brings to $18.9 billion the amount in military assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The funds comprise a combination of immediate shipments from stockpiles as well as contracts for weapons to be delivered over the next three years.\n\nOver the past several months, General Donahue, who commanded the American evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021, has helped oversee training in Ukraine, talking to Ukrainian generals about their battlefield needs and drawing on his Special Operations background to advise his Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nGeneral Donahue and his staff have been deployed to Poland and Germany since the early days of the war. His staff recently returned to its main headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., where they were greeted this week by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. General Donahue will remain in Germany until his successor arrives, Pentagon officials said.\n\nThe new command, which will report to Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the top American officer in Europe, will carry out the decisions made by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 40 countries that the Defense Department created after the Russian invasion to address Ukraines needs and requests. Senior military officials from the member nations met in Brussels this week.\n\nThe changes, which aim to give a formal structure to what has been improvised since the wars onset, are roughly modeled on U.S. train-and-assist efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades.",

                "cc_text": "Russia launched its largest bombardment yet of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure on November 15. The wave of attacks on targets across the country was part of Moscows efforts to deprive the Ukrainian civilian population of heating, water, and electricity ahead of the winter season. Russias airstrike campaign to methodically destroy Ukraines civilian infrastructure is raising fears of a humanitarian disaster with tens of millions potentially at risk.\n\nSince early October, Russia has launched hundreds of missiles and kamikaze drones at key infrastructure targets including Ukrainian power plants, large substations which facilitate the flow of electricity to consumers, high-voltage transmission lines, and distribution lines across the country. This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses.\n\nThe clear goal of the attacks is to prevent generators from delivering electricity to the power system and, in particular, to damage and destroy high voltage networks. If successful, this will prevent Ukraine from providing heating and electricity to millions of consumers. As a result of the damage caused by Russian airstrikes, Ukrainian transmission system operator Ukrenergo is already having difficulty balancing the power system and continuously delivering electricity.\n\nBy early November, up to 40% of Ukraines electricity infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed by Russian airstrikes. This lost generation capacity is in addition to the six gigawatt (GW) Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is now in Russian hands, and approximately 5GW of thermal, wind, and solar capacity which has been destroyed or fallen under Russian control.\n\nRussias infrastructure bombing campaign has been so severe that in one single attack no less than eight missiles were fired at a thermal power plant in eastern Ukraine to ensure its destruction. Despite the severity of the bombing, Ukrainian technicians and engineers have been rushing to repair the damaged infrastructure, often risking their lives amid the threat of further airstrikes. Nevertheless, the situation is fast becoming critical.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nUkraines generation capacity is not the main issue. Bottlenecks are primarily being caused by damaged overhead high-voltage lines and transformers which carry electricity from one circuit to another. To deal with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has been carrying out rolling blackouts, with urban areas experiencing regular scheduled cut-offs as the country seeks to save electricity. This is a viable short-term solution, but there will soon be a growing need to keep the lights and heating on as temperatures begin to plummet with the arrival of winter.\n\nUkraine has a number of options as the country looks to address Russias infrastructure bombing campaign. These include saving electricity in large quantities, ramping up the work of thermal plants, importing electricity, and speeding up repair works. Right now, Ukraine has over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, which would normally be enough to support gas-fired electricity and heating generation this winter. However, with a general gas supply crunch in Europe following widespread Russian curtailments, fuel would need to be saved to ensure Ukraine has sufficient volumes next year.\n\nIf Russia does not destroy municipal heating plants in major Ukrainian cities such as Lviv, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, residents in these areas will likely continue to have access to gas-fired heating this winter. At the same time, most of Ukraines thermal power plants run on coal and there is a looming risk of a deficit. Ukraine could theoretically buy coal abroad, but imports would be commercially unattractive because the price of coal is around three times higher than in Ukraine, where prices have been subsidized since 2019.\n\nThe same would apply to electricity imports. Ukraine is currently synchronized with the European grid and could use up to 0.4 GW of interconnection capacity to import electricity from Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary together with Moldova. However, electricity prices in Europe are at least two times higher than in Ukraine, making it commercially difficult for domestic importers to secure volumes from abroad.\n\nWith winter fast approaching, Ukraine must urgently fix the countrys damaged energy infrastructure. The success of these repair efforts will depend heavily on extensive donations of equipment. Since the start of the war, the Energy Community Secretariat, an international institution which has been helping Ukraine to reform its energy sector, has been working actively to attract and coordinate targeted donations.\n\nThe institution set up the Ukraine Support Task Force (USTF) as a one-stop shop, working together with the European Commissions Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) and Ukraines Energy Ministry to receive requests for donations from companies in need while also securing equipment, tools, generators, and fuel from international partners and coordinating shipments to Ukraine.\n\nSo far, 33 shipments with a total weight of 550 metric tons have already been delivered via USTF coordination. Donations have come from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. These donations are collected at set locations in Romania, Slovakia, and Poland before being sent to Ukraine.\n\nWith Russia now openly attempting to bomb Ukraine into submission, there is an urgent need for far more support. The highest priorities are transformers, mobile generators, and heaters. There is also an urgent need for current and voltage transformers, circuit breakers, disconnectors, protection systems, and surge arresters. Even if the equipment specifications do not fit perfectly, Ukrainian engineers are usually still able to find ways to adapt the equipment and use it. Any new, used, or slightly out of order equipment that international companies may still have in stock would be gratefully received.\n\nThe importance of equipment, generators, and fuel donations has already been highlighted by G7 countries. There is now a pressing need for concrete action in support of these statements. Vladimir Putin is attempting to engineer an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in order to rescue his failing invasion. He must not be allowed to succeed.\n\nDr. Aura Sabadus is a senior energy journalist who writes about Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Ukraine for Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based global energy and petrochemicals news and market data provider.

During an unprecedented global food crisis, they said, the plight of the worlds hungry must not be ignored. As was true in Kings time, the fierce urgency of our own time also is a moral one: to take decisive action to correct a great injustice and source of global instability.\n\nAt the Forum, which the Atlantic Council co-hosted with the Gaurav & Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation as well as Indonesias Ministry of Defense and Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Investment, leading officials and experts from around the world examined the complexity, fragility, and unsustainability of todays global food system. They assessed the numerous and often complex roots of global food insecurity and the many equally complex consequences. These roots range from near-term shocks to the global food systemfor example, the awful destructiveness of the war in Ukraine or unforeseen spikes in energy pricesto longer-term and more structural challenges such as the significant and possibly catastrophic impacts of climate change on food production. The consequences then ripple through global food supply chains, reflected in the increasing prices of grain, fertilizers, and foodstuffs. Price spikes in turn harm all who depend on price stability, most especially the worlds poor.\n\nThe Forums participants repeatedly returned to one consistent theme: that the victims of food insecurity are ordinary people whose suffering cannot be overlooked. Today, hunger and famine threaten an estimated 828 million people every single day. Nearly fifty million are children under age five suffering from acute malnutrition. Those numbers, unfortunately, are trending in the wrong direction, the result of a confluence of factors including the war in Ukraine, distortions in oil and gas markets, the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, and the increasing impacts of climate changedrought, extreme heat, and flooding. The United Nations World Food Programme estimates that it will feed some 150 million hungry people in 2022a new record, beating the old one established in 2021.\n\nTherein lies a source of enormous trouble. Even if we were to put aside the moral case for relieving hunger, which we never should do, we still would need to recognize just how serious a threat widespread hunger is to global stability and prosperity. Food is the most immediate need that people have. Not having enough food destroys the individual, the family, and the community. Hunger attacks the stomach, strikes fear in the mind, and hardens the heart. If enough people see their families and children go without, hunger becomes the wellspring of insecurity: social unrest, political instability, forced out-migration, even violence and warfare. In such circumstances, no one is immune. Human history is replete with revolutions begun by the hungry and desperate.\n\nSuch a grim future need not be our fate. Although they were clear-eyed about the difficulties of the current situation, Forum participants expressed great hope that humankind can solve the multifaceted problems that give rise to hunger. Real, feasible solutions exist today, or are coming soon, if we have the foresight to see their potential and the courage to invest in them. Humans always possess agency, which means no obstacle is immovable. As difficult as it may be, we can resolve conflicts, fix global supply chains, diversify food production, eliminate food waste, put a stop to our assault on the natural world that gives us our bounty, and ultimately end hunger.\n\nThe Global Food Security Forum featured a rich discussion of the steps that the international community can take in the days and months ahead. For G20 member states, meeting this week in Bali, the fierce urgency of their task will be to have the foresight and courage to embrace innovative and transformative solutions to the challenge of global hunger.\n\nSeveral of the policy recommendations that came out of the Forum are distilled below. All credit goes to the Forums speakers and participants:\n\nEnd the war in Ukraine on Ukraines terms . By far the Forums most common recommendation was to stop the war in Ukraine and end it on Ukrainian terms. Russias invasion has been a significant driver of soaring prices for food and agricultural inputs (fertilizer and fuel) during 2022. Russia can stop the war in Ukraine if it chooses to do so.\n\n.

Strengthen global norms and laws against the weaponization of food . Although there are provisions in international humanitarian law (IHL) that can be interpreted as opposing the use of food as a weapon of war, the status of IHL measures against weaponizing food are murky. Strengthening IHL in this context is imperative if the international community is to draw brighter lines against deliberately causing hunger and starvation during warfare.\n\n.

Elevate food security on the multilateral agenda . The Forums participants also were unanimous in calling for enhanced food security coordination at the highest levels of global governance. Food security dialogues should be created for this purpose as part of multilateral forums such as the G20 and Group of Seven (G7) summits. Forum participants embraced the idea of creating a standing yearly G20 dialogue as an informal advisory mechanism to annual G20 Summits.\n\n.

The international financing of emergency food reserves should be a greater priority, as doing so addresses the immediate needs of hungry people during food crises.

Bolster norms against grain export controls . During food security crises, including the 2022 crisis, grain-exporting states create export controls to protect domestic industries and consumers. Such controls, which are often self-defeating, reduce global trade in food commodities that already have become scarce.

Increase fertilizer production over the short run, and remake fertilizer types in the long run . Rising energy prices severely impact fertilizer production, which in turn reduces fertilizer use, particularly by poor farmers. G20 member states should take a variety of actions to combat fertilizer price spikes, including expanding fertilizer production plants around the world, reducing fertilizer trade barriers, making sure that fertilizers are applied as efficiently as possible by farmers, and ensuring that fertilizer subsidies are as effective as possible and oriented toward the greatest need. Over the longer run, fertilizers need to be made more sustainable, including through their decarbonization and integration into the circular economy. Governments should increase investment in projects, for example, that turn food wastea massive problem on its owninto fertilizer.\n\n.

Make the worlds food system more resilient and sustainable through diversification and investment in nature-based solutions . The global food system is efficient but fragile, depending on too few breadbaskets delivering too few types of grains and with too much impact on the natural world. Diversification of food systems everywhere should be prioritized, including by geography (more breadbaskets) and by commodity (expansion of the number of crops that are grown and traded at scale). Greater investment in nature-based solutions is imperative, including in agroforestry, sustainable fishing and aquaculture, urban agriculture, soil conservation and soil sequestration, waste reduction and recycling, and more.\n\n.

Enhance and grow investments in innovation, ranging from research and development (R&D) to on-farm applications . Innovation is key to solving many of the worlds food security problems. Governments should expand investments in basic science (the underpinning of all technological advancement), support innovation ecosystems that can quickly identify and scale on-farm and off-farm food security solutions, and otherwise embrace innovative experimentation through public policies. As younger generations embrace technology, turning farming and other food-producing sectors into tech-centric endeavors can encourage younger people to build careers in these sectors.\n\n.

Boost agricultural extension services everywhere. Agricultural extension services provide smallholding farmers with greater knowledge, skills, and tools to advance their farming needs. Governments should expand such services to ensure that accurate and practical information and skills are transmitted as swiftly and thoroughly as possible. Such programs not only improve food production but also strengthen rural communities.\n\nPeter Engelke is a deputy director and senior fellow with the Atlantic Councils Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security as well as a nonresident senior fellow with the Councils Global Energy Center.\n\nFurther reading\n\nImage: Farmer Mykola Tereshchenko reacts while speaking to Reuters about the harvest, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, on a wheat field in the village of Khreshchate, in Chernihiv region, Ukraine July 5, 2022.

                "cc_text": "Ukraine war: Celebration in Kherson - but war 'far from over'\n\nFootage from social media shows a Ukrainian soldier shouting \"Greetings from Kherson\"\n\nUkrainian officials have warned \"the war is not over\" after Russia's withdrawal from Kherson, even as celebrations continue over the weekend.\n\nCheering crowds welcomed Ukrainian troops to the city - the only regional capital taken by Moscow since February - on Friday.\n\nSimilarly jubilant scenes were reported in other regions across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv, and Odesa.\n\nBut despite the blow to Moscow's ambitions, officials remain cautious.\n\nYuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, warned the BBC it was \"too early to relax\".\n\n\"We always believed that we would liberate Kherson,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \"And we are confident that now Russians are beginning to believe that they will never be able to win this war. We see the panic in their ranks. We see the panic in their propaganda machine.\n\n\"But of course, this is a very important moment, but... this war is far from over.\"\n\nKherson lacks running water, medicines and food, but emergency supplies are starting to arrive from nearby Mykolaiv, an aide to the city's mayor says.\n\nThe aide, Roman Golovnya, says 70-80,000 people live in Kherson now, out of a pre-war population of 320,000.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said that \"before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure - communications, supply of water, heat, electricity\".\n\nIt is not yet clear when electricity will be restored to the city - nearby areas are expected to get it back in a few days' time. The power cuts prevented Kherson's bakeries from making bread.\n\nUkrainian forces have begun the huge task of dismantling Russian mines and booby-traps in and around Kherson, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian TV has resumed broadcasts in the area - a key source of news for many Ukrainians.\n\nYuriy Sak warned of the continuing risk of missile attacks - as did Oleksiy Kuleba, head of the Kyiv region's military administration. Russia has been firing missiles at Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent weeks, severely damaging the country's output.\n\nMr Kuleba told the BBC: \"Over the past month... we have seen massive shelling of peaceful settlements in Ukraine. Now I want to say that the threat of rocket attacks on the Kyiv region remains high.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the former head of Ukraine's National Security Council, Oleksandr Danylyuk, has warned that the Russian troops who have retreated from Kherson will have crossed the Dnipro river to \"go into deep defence on the left bank\", telling the BBC \"it will put them [at an] advantageous position\".\n\nMoscow said some 30,000 personnel had been taken out of the area - as well as around 5,000 pieces of military hardware, weaponry and other assets.\n\nAs BBC international editor Jeremy Bowen points out, the decision to pull out \"has preserved the lives of soldiers who might have died fighting a battle they could not win\" and allowed them to be deployed elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence noted on Saturday that it was \"highly likely\" Russian troops destroyed road and rail bridges over the Dnipro river as part of their retreat. Images emerged on Friday of the main river crossing - the Antonivsky Bridge - having partially collapsed. It remains unclear how the damage was caused.\n\nOn Saturday morning, other images emerged showing damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam, some 58km (36 miles) north-east of Kherson city.\n\nUS satellite imagery firm Maxar tweeted that \"sections of the dam and sluice gates\" had been destroyed. A road and railway line both run across the dam and Maxar's photos show that they have been severed. It is not clear what caused the damage, which the BBC has not independently assessed.\n\nNew video footage, verified by the BBC, shows a huge explosion at one end of the dam.\n\nUkraine and Russia have accused each other of planning to breach the dam with explosives, raising the threat of flooding in the Kherson region.\n\nWatch: The moment an explosion hits dam near Kherson\n\nThe withdrawal - which the UK's Ministry of Defence suggests could have started as early as 22 October under the cover of the civilian evacuation - means Russia has lost the administrative capital of one of the four regions it illegally annexed in September.\n\nOn Saturday, Moscow announced its temporary replacement capital would be a port city called Henichesk, more than 200km (125 miles) south-east of Kherson, near Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nRussia's Interfax news agency says the authorities evacuated all the regional offices, as well as \"statues and historic artefacts\", from the west bank of the Dnipro river - that is, from Kherson city and its surroundings. More than 115,000 people were evacuated from that area, it reports.\n\nThe UK's Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, said the retreat from Kherson marked \"another strategic failure\" for Moscow.\n\n\"In February, Russia failed to take any of its major objectives except Kherson,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Now with that also being surrendered, ordinary people of Russia must surely ask themselves: 'What was it all for?'\"",

Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON The United States on Wednesday accused North Korea of covertly shipping a \"significant number\" of artillery shells to Russia to aid its war effort in Ukraine, a sign that Moscow is increasingly turning to pariah states for military supplies as the grinding conflict persists.\n\nThe White Houses national security spokesman, John Kirby, said that it was unclear if the artillery munitions, which are being transferred through the Middle East and North Africa, had reached Russia. The United States does not believe that the additional weapons will alter the trajectory of the war.\n\n\"Our indications are the DPRK is covertly supplying and were going to monitor to see whether shipments are received,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"Our information indicates that theyre trying to obscure the method of supply by funneling them through other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\"\n\nNorth Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so.\n\nThe Biden administration said in September that Russia was seeking to purchase artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The United States is also concerned that Iran may be shipping drones and surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nMr. Kirby said that Russia had now gone beyond shopping for such artillery and had made purchases. He would not elaborate on how the weapons were being transported or whether the United States intends to try to intercept them.\n\nThe United States believes that Ukraine will continue to have the ability to defend itself if the North Korean munitions do reach Russia.\n\n\"We dont we dont believe that this will change the course of the war,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nThe State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the United States would use \"every tool\" to enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, and would \"look at additional tools and authorities that we may be able to call upon to counter this activity.\"\n\nHe also urged nations that have relations with North Korea to pressure its government not to provide weapons to Russia.\n\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting.",

But the flight is emblematic of what is rapidly emerging as a key alliance in Vladimir Putins war with Ukraine as Moscow leans heavily on Iran to bolster its ruinous invasion.\n\nThe result is an extraordinary flow of aircraft between Iran and Russia which Western allies claim is bringing the Kremlin weaponry from Shahed-136 \"suicide\" drones to what Kyiv fears is an imminent arrival of ballistic missiles capable of penetrating Ukraines air defences.\n\nIn the opposite direction, it was reported this week that Moscow is sending not only vast sums of money to pay for Iranian arms but sweeteners to seal its deal with the ayatollahs which include British and Western weaponry captured in Ukraine and nuclear expertise.\n\nIntelligence experts believe that Tehran is looking to capitalise on its shifting relationship with Russia as an arms supplier by using Ukraine as a \"shop window\" for its weaponry to boost sales around the world to regimes which already include such far-flung pariah states as Venezuela and Syria.\n\nA Russian-made Ilyushin cargo jet belonging to Irans sanctioned Pouya Air was seen delivering a cargo of boxes to Moscows Vnukovo Airport on 3 November. i has tracked the plane back to a secure terminal at Tehrans Mehrabad airport (Source: t.me/milinfolive)\n\nAn investigation by i into the operation of the logistics of what is feared to be a deepening pact between Moscow and Tehran seeking to swap materiel and knowledge needed to confront the West has used flight tracking data and satellite images to reveal 70 flights from Iran to Russia by aircraft sanctioned by the US on suspicion of transporting cargoes from drones to military electronic components.\n\nThe flights by jets owned by companies linked to the Iranian state or military, in particular the all-powerful Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), have been occurring at a rate of at least two a week and can be shown to visit in some cases highly-sensitive military airport facilities.\n\nSatellite pictures show that the Pouya Air Ilyushin-76 is operating from a secure terminal in Tehrans Mehrabad airport which was used this summer by a Russian military plane alleged by to have carried some 140m (123m) in cash as well as captured British and American weaponry, including a Belfast-made NLAW anti-tank weapon.\n\ni s investigation shows four sanctioned, ageing Iranian Boeing 747s operated by Iran Air, Mahan Air, Qeshm Fars Air and Saha Airlines all accused by Western intelligence of having links to the Iranian military have been frequent visitors to Moscow, plus other Putin-allied capitals including Beijing and Damascus, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.\n\nThe US government said there has been a \"significant increase\" in Iranian cargo flights to Russia since the invasion began, with activities by the Tehran regime amounting to \"support for Russias war machine, including the recent provisioning of unmanned aerial vehicles [UAVs, or drones].\"\n\nAssistant US commerce secretary Matthew Axelrod, announcing the sanctions in September, said Putin was using Iran to \"backfill\" supplies and the planes were \"flying and transporting goods, including electronic items\" to Russia in apparent violation of US export controls.\n\nThe distinctive shape and colour scheme of a Pouya Air Ilyushin-76, bottom left, is seen at a secure terminal at Tehrans Mehrabad airport on 7 November, just days after flight EP-PUS was seen unloading boxes at Moscow Vnukovo. i has learned the terminal is operated by Pars Aviation Services, which currently subject to US and British sanctions accused of maintaining aircraft used by the Irans all-powerful Revolutionary Guard (Satellite image copyright 2022 Maxar Technologies)\n\nWashington has also placed another firm, Tehran-based Safiran Airport Services, a subsidiary of Iran Air, under sanctions, accusing it of co-ordinating military flights between Iran and Russia. The US Treasury accused Safiran of \"transporting Iranian UAVs, personnel and related equipment\" which Moscow intended to deploy against Ukraine.\n\nA Western security source told i : \"This is on one level a relationship of convenience. Iran and Russia are no friends of the West and they will now see no reason for concealing that. But what needs to be considered very seriously is the increasing depth and complexity of that relationship. What is Iran willing to sell to Russia and what is Russia willing to give in return?\"\n\nA second source told i it is \"100 per cent possible\" that Iran is shipping suicide drones to Russia by air, adding: \"Its pretty easy to ship these things.\"\n\nThe source said: \"The Iranians dont really have an air mobility wing like the UK or the US. Some of the Boeing 747s they are using are nearly 40 years old. Theyre taking a risk [of the munitions blowing up en route] trying to get these things to the front, but thats because they are incentivised to do that.\n\n\"One theory is that the flights are also about other things that theyre sharing. We know for certain that the Russians are sending things they capture on the battlefield back to Iran so they can exploit the technology. It could also be about exchanging intelligence personnel because we know their networks collaborate at a high level.\"\n\nDrone Air? The 70 wartime flights by Iranian cargo jets to Moscow i s investigation centres on four US sanctioned Iranian Boeing 747s operated by Iran Air, Mahan Air, Qeshm Fars Air and Saha Airlines all accused by Western intelligence of having links to the Iranian military. Mahan Air plane EP-MEE has made the most trips to Moscows Sheremetyevo and Vnokovo airports at 31, including 10 in October alone. It was parked on the apron at the Vnokovo as recently as Thursday this week before being scheduled to fly back to Tehran. In 2018, the US Treasury accused Mahan of transporting IRGCs Qud Force \"operatives, weapons, equipment and funds abroad\". It said: \"The Iranian regime uses Mahan Air as a tool to spread its destabilising agenda around the world, including to the corrupt regimes in Syria and Venezuela, as well as terrorist groups throughout the Middle East\". In September, opposition figures in Tbilisi claimed Georgias leaders were offering a \"back door\" to Iranian airlines after tracking seen by i showed another sanctioned jet, Iran Air EP-ICD, overflew the country on route to Moscow from Iran via Armenian airspace. In other cases, the sanctioned planes have disappeared from view at 30,000ft over the Caspian Sea and as they entered Kazakhstan. A third sanctioned Iranian jet, Qeshm Fars Airs EP-FAA, appears to have visited Russias Chkalovsky military transport airbase in July, among 21 flights to Moscow. Both Qeshm Fars Air and Mahan have previously been designated under the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist list. The US also claims Iran Air has previously transported military-related equipment on behalf of the IRGC. The fourth jet, Saha Airlines jet EP-SIH, has made five trips to the Russian capital, the tracking data analysed by i suggests. The US Commerce Department said the airline is owned and operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. Satellite images of a Saha Airlines liveried Boeing 747 with its nose cone open being loaded or unloaded on the military side of Irans Mashhad airport shortly after EP-SIH, thought to be the airlines only jumbo jet, returned from Moscow.

The US Commerce Department says the airline is owned and operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (Satellite image copyright 2022 Maxar Technologies) The fifth Iranian plane tracked by i , Pouya Airs Ilyushin-76 registered EP-PUS, has flown 30 times to Moscow since April, including four trips in seven days last month. It takes the total Moscow flights including the four sanctioned Boeing 747s to nearly 100. It was this plane that was seen disgorging its cargo of large boxes at Moscow Vnukovo on 3 November. The airline was previously known as Yas Air, which is on a current list of HM Treasury Iran sanctions. It was back in Moscow on Friday, stopping on the ground for just one hour and 18 minutes before flying back to Iran. i has traced the jet back to a secure terminal at Tehrans Mehrabad airport, which is understood to have been used by a Russian military plane in the summer alleged to have carried more than 1m in cash and captured British and American weaponry to Tehran. The terminal is operated by Pars Aviation Services, which is currently the subject of both US and British sanctions accused of maintaining aircraft used by the IRGC, whose commanders have been named by Washington as leading talks with Moscow earlier this year which led to the sale of Shahed-136 \"kamikaze\" drones used by Russia in recent weeks to bombard Ukrainian cities in a campaign designed to destroy civilian energy and water infrastructure.

(Source: t.me/milinfolive)\n\ni s findings were based on our own analysis of publicly-available flight tracking data, including examining more than 700 individual aircraft movements, arising from US sanctions documents and information provided by the Ukrainian authorities, and backed up with satellite imagery we obtained and interviews with sources. Separate research by a Netherlands-based aviation blogger found a similar pattern of flights.\n\nOur investigation comes after i also exclusively revealed last month that Moscow had used at least 90 Shahed-136 \"loitering munitions\" sourced from the Iranian regime despite the decades-long sanctions regime placed on Tehran and how they included components made by British, American and other Western manufacturers.\n\nUkrainian intelligence has made claims that Iran sent technicians and experts to Crimea and possibly Belarus to advise the Russians on how to use the drones.\n\nSome two decades after it was first condemned by former US president George W Bush as a member of an \"axis of evil\" accused of sponsoring terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction, Iran now faces accusations that it has pivoted to a malign partnership with Russia in which it holds unprecedented leverage.\n\nAn investigation by i using publicly available flight tracking data has revealed 70 flights from Iran to Russia by cargo planes sanctioned by the US amid mounting concern about Vladimir Putins use of Iranian weapons to target Ukrainian civilians. In many cases the tracking cuts out over Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea and the departure point in Iran is often not shown (Graphic by Nick Coles/the i paper)\n\nAfter decades in which Russia was a key supplier of weaponry to the Islamic Republic, suddenly the tables have been turned and Moscow, having failed to invest sufficiently in areas such as military drone technology, is coming cap in hand to Tehran.\n\nIndeed, as Nikolai Patrushev, one of Putins closest advisors and head of Russias Security Council, arrived in Tehran this week for talks on closer co-operation \"in the field of security\", Washington has made it clear that it believes Iran is preparing a shipment to Moscow of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles and more advanced unmanned aircraft, potentially including its latest Arash-2 suicide drone.\n\nThe ballistic missiles, which have a range of up 450 miles, would represent a particular boost for Russia which has seen its own stocks of similar munitions dwindle and is struggling to manufacture replacements suitable for continuing its bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.\n\nAn Iranian Shahed drone is seen in the sky seconds before it dives on buildings in Kyiv. An investigation by i last month revealed Russia had used at least 90 of them to target Ukrainians (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)\n\nExperts argue that Tehran has spotted a grim but valuable financial, intelligence and marketing opportunity in Ukraine as the countrys towns and cities attest to the destruction that can be wrought by its Shahed-136 drones dubbed \"flying lawnmowers of death\" even as Kyivs forces become adept at shooting them down.\n\nSine Ozkarasahin, defence analyst at the Istanbul-based independent think-tank, the Centre of Economics and Foreign Policy Studies, told i : \"The desire to build an international name for its drones is surely an important motive for Tehran because, at the end of the day, testing military technologies on the battlefield is the best way to build a reputation. At the moment, running out of its critical missile systems and searching for cheap and fast alternatives, Russia is also a very lucrative market for Tehran in terms of defense economics. [Iran] is surely achieving some leverage over Russia, especially in the context of the current war.\"\n\nThe precise nature of that leverage remains to be seen but its early outlines are perhaps increasingly clear.\n\nThe reports that Russia has provided Tehran with seized weapons such as the UKs NLAW anti-tank weapon, used to devastating effect in the early phase of the war, and the American Stinger anti-aircraft missile raises the prospect of Iran seeking to reverse engineer advanced Western weaponry. The country has previously proved adept at producing facsimiles of captured technology, including an American RQ-17 Sentinel drone captured in 2011 whose internal workings are widely thought to have been copied for platforms including the Shahed drones.\n\nFirefighters work after a drone attack on buildings in Kyiv, Ukraine in October. As protests rage at home, Irans theocratic government is increasingly flexing its military muscle abroad, including supplying drones to Russia that now kill Ukrainian civilians (AP Photo/Roman Hrytsyna)\n\nMore disturbing yet is another potential quid pro quo in the rapprochement between Russia and Iran in the shape of nuclear technology.\n\nWith hope of progress on the restoration of the joint nuclear deal between Tehran and the West all but abandoned for now, and Moscow showing itself willing to indulge in nuclear sabre rattling, there is nervousness in Ukraine and Western capitals about Iran cashing in on Russian expertise to further its ambitions with nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia built Irans sole nuclear reactor in the Persian Gulf city of Bushehr, where it is responsible for providing and recycling uranium fuel rods, and recently signed a $10bn (8.8bn) contract to provide two more reactors. The concern is that by increasing Iranian access to nuclear fuel, Tehran could further shorten the period it needs to refine uranium to point it can be used in a bomb.\n\nAs the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky put it recently: \"I have a question for you how does Russia pay Iran for [weapons], in your opinion? Is Iran just interested in money? Probably not money at all, but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear programme. Probably, this is exactly the meaning of their alliance.\"",

But on Tuesday, the lights went out again.\n\n\"I cant fill the big bottles with water because the pump doesnt work,\" Natalia said. \"If someone comes with a small bottle for three liters, or if a mother with a child comes, then I will fill their bottles with water, even if it takes some time.\" CNN is not using her and other interviewees last names at their own request.\n\nAround 80% of residents were left without running water on Monday with many losing electricity, too following power outages caused by Russian strikes, the capitals mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram.\n\nOne of the strikes hit an energy facility that powered 350,000 apartments in the capital, Klitschko said, adding that emergency services were attempting to restore power and \"stabilize the situation as soon as possible.\"\n\nBut as temperatures drop across Ukraine, Russias recurrent bombardments are making life more difficult for the millions of people who still live in and around Kyiv and raising fears about an arduous winter ahead.\n\nBlackouts have gripped Kyiv in recent days after Russian strikes left around 40% of Ukraine's entire energy infrastructure damaged. Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto/Reuters\n\nAt school, pupils arent scared anymore\n\nMondays attacks marked yet another reminder that Kyiv is firmly back in the grips of Russias war on Ukraine.\n\nSeveral months of ground combat had pulled the theater of conflict towards Ukraines east, allowing a semblance of normality to settle in Kyiv during the summer months. But that changed on the morning of October 10, when Moscow launched the first of a fresh wave of missile and rocket strikes on the city and several others across Ukraine.\n\nFor many citizens, it dawned quickly that a difficult winter was coming. \"Lately theres been more people,\" Natalia told CNN. \"On October 10 we had a huge queue here. In a day we sold what we usually sell in a week.\"\n\n\"The situation now is very unstable, so people want to have some stocks,\" she said. Members of Ukraines armed forces are among her customers. \"They usually come once or twice a month. We give them a discount and they take a lot.\"\n\nOlha, a 36-year-old college teacher, regularly joins the queues for water, and eventually lost tap water at home following Mondays attacks.\n\nKyiv residents make trench candles for the Ukrainian military. Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\n\"We didnt have electricity or water or even heating,\" she told CNN. \"We are using candles and torch lights in the evening, in case the electricity is off,\" she said, adding that she refrains from using large appliances to help ease pressure on the citys grid.\n\nA generator at her school has helped lessons continue as normal, at least some of the time. \"It does not always work, (and) then we sit without the lights and continue teaching with no lights. Teachers can still teach kids using the books, blackboards old-school, so to say.\"\n\nHer students recognize Ukraines new reality. \"They make the drawings for soldiers, they weave camouflage nets,\" she said. \"In case of air raid (sirens) we go to the shelters and they treat this with understanding; they are not scared anymore.\"\n\nSometimes, teachers continue lessons inside their schools shelters. On other occasions, students sing songs or chat, she said. Public schools have mostly done online classes since October 10.\n\nA defiant city braces for winter\n\nFor Natalia and Olha, as for so many across Kyiv, the impact of Russias air strikes does not end when they leave work.\n\n\"We also experience power outages at home,\" Natalia said. \"I cant cook or reheat food. And its cold now, (so) Id rather eat some hot meal or drink tea.\"\n\nThe temperature in the capital has not dropped to the depths felt in the winter \"its alright for now, we can handle this,\" Natalia says but from November to March, the mercury often drops below freezing.\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv are attempting to prepare, readying about 1,000 \"heating points\" in schools, kindergartens and other sites across the city in case of an emergency, Klitschko said Tuesday.\n\n\"We are considering various scenarios of how events may develop.

Kyiv says they have damaged up to 40% of the power system and Ukrainian authorities warned that residents may face hours of blackouts due to the limited supplies.\n\nThe assistance that will allow Kyiv to defend itself against and respond to Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure included air defence systems, the U.S. official said.\n\n\"There was a decent amount of discussion of that, and what countries have the ability to provide the individual systems and support that might enable Ukraine to better defend itself against these UAV and missile attacks,\" the official added.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba joined the G7 discussion virtually.\n\nMoscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians in what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine to eliminate dangerous nationalists and protect Russian-speakers.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies have accused Iran of sending \"kamikaze\" drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to Russia which have then been used to devastating effect by Russian forces in strikes targeting Ukrainian infrastructure as part of their Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

                "cc_text": "Volume 14, Issue 8\n\nNovember 9, 2022\n\nSince negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), stalled in late August, the political space for reaching an agreement to resurrect the accord has narrowed and prospects for reviving the JCPOA have diminished. Tehrans brutal repression of protesters following the death of Mahsa Amini and Irans military support for Russias war against Ukraine, including the illegal transfer of drones, has shifted U.S. and European focus away from the nuclear talks and increased pressure on the Biden administration to refrain from any further negotiations with the Raisi government.\n\nEven before the protests, Irans negotiating strategy jeopardized the prospects of reaching a deal to restore the JCPOA. In August, as negotiators closed in on an agreement, Tehran derailed progress with its unacceptable and unrealistic demands that the deal include a timetable for ending the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) investigation into past nuclear activities that should have been declared to the agency and a commitment that the IAEA refrain from further investigations into Irans nuclear past. This ultimatum casts doubt on Irans commitment to resurrecting the JCPOA. As Tehran is well aware, there is no space to negotiate over the IAEAs safeguards investigation. The United States and its JCPOA partners cannot and will not pressure the IAEA into actions that are contrary to its safeguards mandate.\n\nFrom a nonproliferation perspective, however, the United States cannot afford to wait for much longer for Iran to moderate its demands over the IAEA investigation or to see how the current protests play out. U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley made clear in an Oct. 31 event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that the United States still supports restoring the JCPOA, but that talks are not the U.S. focus at this time given Irans negotiating position. During the stalemate, the United States continues to enforce nuclear-related sanctions, but these actions are not aimed at stabilizing the current crisis, nor can they.\n\nThe Raisi government has made clear it will continue ratcheting up its nuclear activities in response to perceived provocations from the United States and Europe, including further sanctions. The alarming growth in Irans nuclear program and bleak prospects for JCPOA restoration significantly increase both the threat of Iranian proliferation and the risk that at some point the United States, or more likely Israel, resorts to kinetic action to try and set back Irans nuclear advances in the short term.\n\nGiven these risks, it is imperative for the United States, its partners in the JCPOA, and Iran to begin thinking of steps to stabilize the current nuclear crisis. Trying to negotiate an alternative, interim deal would be time-consuming and face similar challenges to those afflicting the indirect talks to restore U.S. and Iranian compliance with the JCPOA. A more feasible approach would be to focus on reciprocal, confidence-building steps by the United States and Iran designed to prevent further escalation, reduce the risk of proliferation, and decrease the chances of miscalculation. On the nuclear side, increasing the monitoring of Irans nuclear program would be an ideal starting point for stabilizing the current situation. Increasing transparency would provide greater assurance that any move toward an Iranian nuclear weapon or diversion of materials and technologies would be detected more quickly and could help deter Tehran from taking such action.\n\nSuch an approach does not mean that the Biden administration and its European partners must abandon their support for the JCPOA, although restoration of that accord is increasingly unlikely. Rather, it allows the United States and the P4+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom) to preserve space for future diplomacy to restore the nuclear deal or to negotiate a new nuclear agreement. Preventing further nuclear escalation would also benefit U.S. national security by reducing the likelihood of a nuclear-armed Iran or a military conflict to try to prevent it.\n\nIf the United States does attempt to engage with Tehran to stabilize the current nuclear crisis, the Biden administration will face criticism for undermining the protestors and legitimizing the current regime. Failure to constrain Irans nuclear program, however, increases the likelihood of Tehran deciding to develop nuclear weapons, particularly if it feels its regime is under threat and that external forces are responsible for or contributing to the destabilization of the state. U.S. and European involvement in the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and Saddam Hussein in Iraq, years after both leaders abandoned their illicit nuclear weapons programs, may suggest to Iran that a nuclear deterrent is necessary to limit foreign intervention in domestic protests. North Koreas reliance on nuclear weapons to protect the Kim regime may further bolster the assessment in Tehran that nuclear weapons are necessary to preserve the territory and governance structure of Iran.\n\nA nuclear-armed Iran may also be emboldened to use its deterrent to act more aggressively in the region. Russia, for example, is using nuclear threats to try to deter third-party intervention on behalf of Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin's decision to invade the country in February.\n\nWhile dealing with Iran may seem distasteful, particularly now given the governments ruthless crackdown on the peaceful protests, it is necessary. Preventing Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons must remain an urgent policy priority precisely because of the nature of the regime and the lengths it will go to in order to retain power. Unfortunately, the time has come to begin considering alternative diplomatic actions outside of restoring the JCPOA to achieve that goal.\n\nThe Risks Posed by Irans Advancing Nuclear Program\n\nIrans advancing nuclear program poses both short and long-term proliferation risks that will become more serious over time if the United States and its European partners do not soon pivot to a diplomatic strategy designed to stabilize the current nuclear threat. The risk of conflict also increases, as Iran may misjudge the space it has to increase leverage by expanding its nuclear program. Given the relatively muted international response to Tehrans past escalations, such as enrichment to 60 percent, and mixed signals from the United States, Europe, and Israel over what constitutes red lines, there is a significant chance that Iran miscalculates and triggers military action.\n\nIn the short term, Irans ability to \"breakout,\" or produce enough weapons-grade material for a bomb (25 kilograms of uranium enriched to 90 percent), possibly between IAEA inspections, increases the risk and likelihood of proliferation. While the United States is willing to accept the risk of undetectable breakout at this point, this calculation could change as Irans nuclear program advances, the prospects of a deal to restore the JCPOA diminish, or Iran perceives the benefits of nuclear weapons outweighing the costs of their development. A new, more hawkish Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu may also be unwilling to tolerate the low breakout window. Comments from Netanyahu and his allies in recent weeks suggest a greater willingness to use military force to set back Irans nuclear program.\n\nThe U.S. assessment of the proliferation threat may also change as Irans capacity to quickly produce material for multiple nuclear weapons increases. Currently, Iran can produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one nuclear bomb in less than a week. Israeli military officials have publicly stated that weaponization could still take another one to two years, but some experts assess that Iran could move more quickly. Regardless of the precise timeframe, Iran is likely to weaponize at a covert facility, making detection and disruption more difficult. One bombs worth of weapons-grade uranium, however, will have limited strategic value as a deterrent, particularly given that Iran has never conducted an explosive test of a nuclear warhead. But as the timeframe for producing multiple bombs' worth of weapons-grade uranium decreases, Iran's program poses more of a proliferation threat because the security value for Tehran increases significantly if it can build more than one bomb. It would also be more challenging to disrupt an Iranian breakout if Tehran were able to produce multiple bombs' worth of weapons grade uranium and move them to several covert sites.\n\nAs of September, Tehran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for an estimated three bombs in about a month. That one-month timeframe will drop further, even if Iran takes no additional action to expand its uranium enrichment capacity because Tehran continues to stockpile uranium enriched to 60 and 20 percent and install more advanced centrifuges, which enrich uranium more efficiently. The stockpiles of 60 and 20 percent uranium are particularly significant in assessing proliferation risk as material enriched to these levels can be much more quickly enriched to weapons grade.\n\nIran's short breakout window is not, by itself, an indication that Tehran intends to pursue nuclear weapons. It does, however, increase the likelihood of Iran deciding to do so at some point in the future, as Irans internal and external security environment faces new challenges. For instance, the growing perception by Irans current government that the regime is at risk as a result of the current protests or may be at risk down the road could make its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and/or possible pursuit of nuclear weapons appear more beneficial to hardline decision-makers, particularly if Tehran perceives third party states as playing a key role in supporting or instigating the protests.\n\nSimilarly, regional tensions, principally any attack on Irans nuclear infrastructure, could lead the regime to assess that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter future attacks. Irans military support for Russias invasion of Ukraine could also lead Tehran to gamble that Moscow would block or mitigate action by the UN Security Council if Iran were to decide to violate its international legal commitments under the NPT. Perhaps more likely, Iran may calculate that geopolitical divisions would prevent a unified international sanctions campaign against Iran, thus reducing the costs that Tehran would pay for developing nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile external threats and internal dissent have been factors in Tehrans decision-making before, Iran has never been this close to a nuclear weapon in its history. The speed at which Iran could now build a weapon will influence Tehrans calculations, underscoring that the current proliferation risk is not sustainable.\n\nEven if Irans leaders do not make the decision to pursue nuclear weapons, it appears likely that they will continue to assess that further escalation of Iran's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle programs is a sustainable form of leverage. If Iran expands its nuclear program unchecked, the development of new capabilities will have longer-term implications for the proliferation threat and raises new obstacles for future diplomacy.\n\nThere is a range of nuclear-related activities Tehran can pursue to escalate or respond to perceived U.S. provocations that will have a longer-term impact.\n\nIran, for instance, has publicly threatened to enrich uranium to 90 percent, the level considered weapons-grade, and considered beginning enrichment to that level in June 2022 after the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution censuring Iran over the safeguards investigation before deciding to reduce monitoring instead. The U.S. intelligence community also appears to view Irans threat to enrich to 90 percent as serious, noting in the 2022 Worldwide Threat Assessment that Iranian officials \"probably will consider\" enriching to that level if Iran does not receive sanctions relief.\n\nWhile 90 percent enrichment would be one of the more significant escalations that Iran could pursue short of declaring its intention to build nuclear weapons, Tehran may gamble that producing very small quantities of 90 percent enriched uranium, or enriching to that level but not stockpiling the material, would not be enough to incite military action against Tehran. However, even the production of 90 percent in gram quantities would provide Iran with useful, irreversible knowledge applicable to weapons development, even if it does not significantly alter the current breakout.\n\nEven if Tehran views enrichment to 90 percent as too great a risk, Iran has other options, such as expanding its advanced centrifuge work and exploring different cascade designs to increase uranium enrichment efficiency. There is also a range of weaponization-related activities that Iran could pursue while claiming the work is for civil nuclear purposes, such as expanding its uranium metal research. Uranium metal is directly relevant to pursuing an explosive device. The E3 in particular appears concerned about uranium metal activities and has warned Iran against engaging in this key area of weapons-related research.\n\nInitiating new areas of research pose less of a short-term threat, but over the long term, as Iran masters new capabilities, these activities will alter assessments of a proliferation risk because they expand the pathways available to Iran for developing nuclear weapons. There are also implications for diplomacy. New capabilities give Iran more leverage in future negotiations and the lack of monitoring of some of these activities raises further concerns about verification down the road and reestablishing a baseline of Irans nuclear program.\n\nResearch and development also has implications for the nonproliferation value of the JCPOA, decreasing the likelihood that restoration of the accord will remain a viable option if the stalemate in talks continues. For instance, when Iran was fully implementing the JCPOA from 2016 to mid-2019, the time it would take to amass enough material for one bomb was about 12 months. Under a restored JCPOA, Malley told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May 2022 that Irans breakout would be reduced to about six monthsnow probably closer to four-fivebecause of the irreversible knowledge Iran has gained and its development of advanced centrifuges. As a result, the Biden administration may soon assess that the nonproliferation benefits of the JCPOA are no longer worth the sanctions relief Tehran will receive in the return.\n\nThe Growing Monitoring Gap\n\nCompounding the proliferation risks posed by Irans nuclear program is the growing monitoring gap. The lack of transparency regarding Irans nuclear activities has a negative impact on crisis stability and will make future diplomacy more challenging.\n\nCurrently, Iran is subject to minimal IAEA monitoring. Iran is implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement, as required for all non-nuclear weapon states party to the NPT, but history has demonstrated that comprehensive safeguards are insufficient for preventing determined proliferators. Under the safeguards agreement, the IAEA continues to access Iranian facilities where nuclear materials are present, such as the Natanz and Fordow enrichment facilities and the Isfahan fuel fabrication site. The frequency of inspections at those facilities is based on several factors, including enrichment levels, so Tehran is subject to more inspections now that it is enriching to 60 percent. But even with more frequent inspections, a comprehensive safeguards agreement is insufficient for providing assurance in the long run that Irans nuclear program is entirely peaceful. The risk remains that Iran could try to produce enough weapons-grade material between IAEA inspections and divert materials, such as centrifuges, from facilities where the agency is not currently conducting inspections.\n\nWhen the JCPOA was fully implemented, Irans nuclear program was subject to the most intrusive verification regime ever negotiated. Several key sites were subject to continuous surveillance and inspectors had greater access to Iranian nuclear facilities, including sites where nuclear material was not present. Furthermore, unlike many restrictions in the JCPOA, the most crucial element of that monitoring regime, Irans application of more intrusive IAEA safeguards known as the additional protocol, does not expire.\n\nHowever, as part of its response to the U.S. pressure campaign, Iran halted the implementation of the additional protocol and other JCPOA-specific monitoring measures in February 2021. As a result, the agency has not inspected certain facilities integral to the countrys nuclear program, such as its centrifuge production sites and uranium mines and mills, for 20 months. IAEA cameras did continue to collect data from some of these locations and Tehran says it will give the surveillance recordings to the agency in the event of a deal to restore the JCPOA, but many of these cameras have been unplugged since June 2022. Iran disconnected the cameras at that time in response to the IAEA Board of Governors passing a resolution censuring Iran for failing to comply with the agencys safeguards investigation. Further complicating the gaps in monitoring is Irans development of new nuclear facilities since February 2021 that are not covered by the existing safeguards agreement, such as Irans new centrifuge production workshops, and therefore are not being inspected. The IAEA will likely have less clarity about the capabilities and capacities at these locations if the JCPOA is restored or a new deal is reached because of the gaps in access.\n\nAs a result of the reduction in monitoring, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned in September 2022 that the agency will face \"considerable challenges\" in confirming Irans declared inventory of centrifuges and heavy water, even with Tehrans full cooperation. The longer this gap remains, the more difficult it will be for the agency to reconstruct an accurate history of Irans nuclear activities during the monitoring gap.\n\nAny doubt about the baseline will drive speculation that Tehran has diverted materials for covert purposes and could make it more challenging for the United States to assess, as required under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), whether the IAEA can monitor a future nuclear deal.\n\nThe reduction in monitoring also increases the risk of a premature use of force to set back Irans nuclear program. The United States and Israel, the two countries most likely to use force, might be willing to tolerate certain nuclear escalations or the continuation of current activities if there were additional verification mechanisms in place that would more quickly detect any move to try to build nuclear weapons or further increase its enriched uranium stockpiles. For instance, the risk posed by Irans stockpile of uranium enriched to 60 percent might be more manageable if inspectors had daily access to uranium enrichment facilities or if Irans enrichment was monitored in real time again.\n\nEnhanced Monitoring as a Stabilization Step\n\nGiven Irans current breakout time, the risk of Iran crossing a U.S. or Israeli redline as it attempts to build leverage, and the monitoring gaps negative implications for diplomacy in the long run, the United States and its P4+1 partners should focus on increasing transparency as the first step in stabilizing the current situation.\n\nIdeally, additional monitoring mechanisms should be aimed at two objectives: 1) providing greater assurance that any attempt by Iran to breakout will be detected more quickly and 2) providing greater assurance that Iran is not diverting materials from sites that are no longer subject to inspections or surveillance.\n\nIn the short term, addressing these two objectives should help reduce the threat of proliferation and the risk of premature military action to prevent it. Increased monitoring also helps address longer-term proliferation risks by providing additional insight into nuclear activities not currently monitored and could make it easier for the IAEA to reestablish a baseline on Irans nuclear program. Verification activities as a stabilizing step may also be more feasible politically on the Iranian side as it does not require Tehran to halt or roll back any nuclear activities or give up what it perceives as its strongest source of leverage: its HEU stockpiles.\n\nThe most straightforward option for addressing these objectives would be for Iran to resume the implementation of its additional protocol. To distinguish reapplying the additional protocol from Irans actions under the JCPOA, Iran could agree to voluntarily implement the agreement as it did from 2003-2005. This would be a step below the provisional implementation required by the JCPOA. Given that more than 130 countries implement additional protocols, the Raisi government could reply to domestic criticism by arguing that it is conforming with the best practices of responsible nuclear states and not subjecting Iran to unique restrictions.\n\nHowever, even if this step were to be politically feasible in Tehran, Raisi would likely demand a higher price for reapplying the additional protocol than the United States would be willing to pay. The December 2020 law required Iran to suspend the more intrusive safeguards if the parties to the JCPOA \"fail to normalize banking relations, completely remove export barriers, allow complete sale of Iranian oil and petroleum products, and complete and rapid return of foreign exchange [to Iran] from the proceeds of the [oil] sales.\" If Tehran tries to tie the resumption of the additional protocol to these demands, the cost will be too high for the United States, as Washington will also seek to retain its most valuable sources of sanctions leverage for future diplomacy.\n\nThere are, however, creative solutions that would increase transparency and may be more feasible from a political perspective than reapplying the additional protocol. To address the first objective, more rapid detection of breakout, the United States and its partners could press Iran to resume real-time enrichment monitoring as a confidence-building step. Reconnecting the monitors, known as OLEMS, would provide further assurance that any move to enrich to levels greater than 60 percent would be quickly detected. Without the OLEMS in place, traditional methods of sampling and analyzing enrichment levels can take three weeks or longer, according to the IAEA. During that window, Iran could produce enough weapons-grade material for a bomb and divert it.\n\nOther measures that could be considered include resuming daily IAEA access to Natanz and Fordow, which would provide more assurance that Tehran will not try to breakout between inspections. Iran could also move greater portions of its stockpiles of HEU away from the enrichment sites. The material would still be under IAEA safeguards and returning it to Natanz and Fordow would put additional time on the clock and raise questions about whether Iran intended to further enrich the material.\n\nTo address the second objective, deterring diversion, one option would be for the United States and its P4+1 partners to propose that Iran turn the cameras back on at some, or all, of the facilities subject to continuous surveillance under the JCPOA. Prioritization should be given to resuming monitoring of certain facilities, such as centrifuge production workshops and facilities with source materials such as uranium conversion facilities, which pose more of a proliferation risk, as opposed to facilities such as Irans heavy-water production plant, which is less of an immediate concern. Tehran could turn over recordings from these cameras regularly, perhaps quarterly to coincide with the IAEAs regular reports on Irans nuclear program, to help ensure there has been no diversion of nuclear material from these locations. Turning over the recordings regularly would also help demonstrate Irans commitment to a peaceful nuclear program.\n\nAnother option would be for Iran to allow the IAEA to conduct technical visits to certain facilities that inspectors can no longer access. These voluntary, technical visits agreed to by the state have been used in the past when the IAEA has sought inspections beyond what is permitted under a comprehensive safeguards agreement but where the agency did not want to pursue special inspections. If Tehran were to agree to negotiate technical visits for inspectors regularly it could assist the IAEAs efforts in re-establishing a baseline down the road and it increases the likelihood that any diversion of materials from the currently unmonitored facilities would be detected.\n\nFocusing on monitoring and verification as an initial, stabilizing step also provides benefits for Iran. First, allowing additional monitoring and verification would support Irans assertion that its nuclear program is peaceful and that it has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons. The added transparency could also be useful in pushing back against speculation that Iran intends to use the impasse in negotiations to restore the JCPOA to buy time to build up its nuclear program before deciding to build nuclear weapons and/or to siphon off materials for undeclared nuclear activities.\n\nSecond, monitoring and verification reduce the risk of the United States and/or Israel miscalculating the risk posed by Irans nuclear activities and prematurely using force to try and roll back Tehrans nuclear program. These strikes would be very costly to Iran and put at risk the lives of Iranians working at these facilities. Any resort to force would also only set back Irans nuclear program temporarily and is likely, in the long run, to spur further nuclear advances. It could also escalate to a broader conflict.\n\nThird, greater transparency now increases the likelihood that the IAEA will be able to reconstruct a record of Irans nuclear activities. The IAEAs ability to reestablish a baseline and verify the inventory of certain materials related to Irans nuclear program could have an impact on future negotiations, particularly given that under INARA the U.S. administration must provide to Congress an assessment of the IAEAs ability to verify any deal with Iran. Any perception that the IAEA will not be able to monitor an agreement will negatively impact Congressional support for an accord. So, if Iran wants to keep open the option of receiving sanctions relief, it behooves Tehran to recognize the benefits of increasing monitoring now.\n\nIn exchange for Iranian actions to enhance monitoring, the United States and its P4+1 partners could offer relief from specific sanctions, perhaps including limited oil sales to Europe. This would provide Iran with some benefits and could also mitigate the gap in European energy supplies caused by Russias invasion of Ukraine. The United States could also look at sanctions relief that would have positive humanitarian impacts and could be quickly reversed if Iran were to stop voluntarily implementing the monitoring measures or the release of set amounts of Iranian frozen assets.\n\nIf both the United States and Iran take these actions on a voluntary reciprocal basis, the Biden administration could argue that this does not constitute a deal and is not subject to review by Congress under INARA. But even if the Biden administration decides not to make that case or is persuaded that Congress should review these stabilization steps, there is a strong argument that members should support the administrations actions as an interim step to increase the prospects for a future deal. Failure to prevent nuclear escalation will also likely have negative consequences for U.S. national security and increases the risk of the United States becoming embroiled in another conflict in the Middle East, a conflict that Washington can ill afford at this time.\n\nIf these initial, reciprocal steps are successful, the United States and the P4+1 could consider some further corresponding steps that would reduce proliferation risks. This would be particularly beneficial if the United States and Iran decide not to restore the JCPOA and instead pursue negotiations on a new agreement. In that case, creating time and space for prolonged talks by reducing the most imminent threats would increase the likelihood of a successful deal. On the nuclear side, this could include a commitment from Iran to refrain from new research and development activities and/or capping its stockpiles of 60 and 20 percent enriched uranium. This approach would allow Iran to maintain what it views as its most significant source of leverage while preventing Irans breakout for subsequent significant quantities of nuclear materials from further diminishing.\n\nConclusion\n\nNearly two years have passed since the Biden administration took office and set out to negotiate terms with Iran to restore mutual compliance with the JCPOA. The 2015 deal remains the best path forward for both parties, but Iran's impractical demands on issues outside the scope of the JCPOA have stymied progress. Now, the Raisi government's brutal crackdown on growing protests against the regime and its military support for Russia severely complicate the path to restoring the JCPOA. Meanwhile, Iran continues to expand its nuclear program, increasing the proliferation risk and the potential for a military conflict.\n\nGiven the current challenges that the United States is facing in confronting Russian aggression against Ukraine and countering Chinas regional ambitions, Washington can ill afford to be drawn into a conflict with Iran, nor can the United States and the international community afford to see Iran, possibly emboldened by its nuclear weapons capability, become more aggressive in the region and even more repressive domestically.\n\nAs a result, it is necessary to explore options designed to stabilize the current nuclear crisis by increasing monitoring of Irans nuclear program. Such an approach is not a long-term solution or a substitute for a comprehensive agreement that blocks Irans pathways to nuclear weapons, but it is necessary to prevent further deterioration of an already worrisome situation that was triggered by the United States' disastrous 2018 decision to withdraw from the JCPOA. The United States can and must remain focused on a comprehensive diplomatic solution to roll-back Iran's dual-use nuclear activities. But to create the time and space for negotiations the United States and its partners must act now to try to stabilize the current crisis before it is too late.",

Hannibal Hanschke/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russian forces are stepping up their efforts to make life unbearable for civilians across the occupied southern Kherson region, where power was cut on Sunday night and Ukrainian officials warned that Russian troops were mining critical infrastructure even as they dig in to fight for their last bridgehead west of the Dnipro River.\n\nThe battle for Kherson City the only regional capital to be captured by Moscow since the invasion in late February has been looming for months. A Ukrainian counteroffensive launched at the end of August has reclaimed over 100 towns and villages and steadily closed in on Kherson while also pounding Russian supply routes, command centers and ammunition depots far from the front.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced, the Kremlin-appointed authorities for Kherson ordered the \"evacuation\" of all civilians last month a move that Ukrainian officials said was less about saving lives and more about clearing space for newly mobilized Russian troops to occupy. Since then, Russian forces have been destroying critical infrastructure, shuttering essential services and looting the city, according to residents and Ukrainian officials.\n\nUkraines military said in an evening update on Monday that Russian forces were \"taking measures to artificially create unacceptable living conditions for local residents, disconnecting electricity and communication.\"\n\nPetro, a 30-year-old who lives in the area, managed to get a message out late Sunday night, saying, \"They are making a desert out of the right bank of Kherson.\" Because of concerns about his safety, he communicated on the condition that his family name not be used.\n\n\"Today they blew up the power poles, so we have no light and no water,\" Petro added.\n\nWhile state media in Russia said that Ukrainian shelling had damaged the power lines, Yaroslav Yanushevych, the exiled Ukrainian head of the Kherson regional military administration, blamed Russian troops.\n\n\"It is impossible to quickly repair the power lines due to a lack of specialists and equipment,\" he said Sunday night. \"In addition, Russian invaders will not allow this to be done.\"\n\nThe Russian forces have also placed mines around water towers in Beryslav, Mr. Yanushevych said, referring to a town less than 50 miles from Kherson City and just north of a critical dam.\n\nRussian forces seized the road over that dam, next to the town of Nova Kakhovka, in the first days of the war, and it is the main artery across the Dnipro River still under the control of Russian forces. If Ukraine regains control of the area, they could prevent thousands of Russian soldiers from escaping.\n\nUkrainian forces are still meeting fierce resistance as they continue battling Russian troops arrayed some 30 miles to the north of the dam.\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials have accused each other of planning to blow up the dam. But military analysts have said that doing so would be logistically challenging and would not serve either armys interests because it would cause flooding and destruction on both sides of the Dnipro.\n\nStill, Ukraines nuclear regulator on Monday ordered an urgent review of the safety risks upriver at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant if the dam were to be damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian military high command said on Monday that the destruction of critical infrastructure was part of a coordinated campaign to undermine its forces and warned that Moscow had dispatched propagandists \"to shoot videos in the city on the topic of the alleged destruction of the civilian population.\"\n\nTop government officials in Kyiv have also said that Moscow might be trying to create the illusion of leaving Kherson to lure Ukrainian forces into brutal urban combat. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said that it still had seen no evidence that Russian forces were preparing to abandon Kherson.\n\nBut the Ukrainian authorities warned that Russian forces were stepping up the hunt for people helping to direct military strikes. The Russians have \"intensified raids and filtration measures among the local population,\" the National Resistance Center, a government agency supporting resistance efforts in occupied areas, said on Monday.\n\nSo-called filtration centers were set up by Russia to temporarily detain and screen Ukrainians and identify anyone perceived to pose a threat to Russias occupation efforts. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that Russian authorities had \"forcibly deported\" between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens to Russian territory,\n\nThe National Resistance Center said that it was aware of \"dozens of detainees\" who were being taken to camps, saying that once there, they would be interrogated and tortured. The claim could not be independently verified.",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nA previous media report, in The Washington Post, said Washington was privately encouraging Ukraine to signal an openness to negotiate with Russia, as the State Department said Moscow was escalating the war and did not seriously wish to engage in peace talks.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, said the request by U.S. officials was not aimed at pushing Ukraine to the negotiating table, but a calculated attempt to ensure Kyiv maintains the support of other countries.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told RFE/RL it was absurd to suggest that Western countries that are supplying Ukraine with weapons would push Kyiv to negotiate on Moscow's terms.\n\n\"Ukraine receives from its partners, first of all from the United States, quite effective weapons,\" he said. \"We are pushing the Russian Army out of territory. And against this background, forcing us to the negotiation process, and in fact to recognize the ultimatum of the Russian Federation, is nonsense! And no one will do that.\"\n\nHe said suggestions the West was pushing Ukraine to negotiate were part of Russia's \"information program,\" though he did not directly rebut a report in The Washington Post.\n\nZelenskiy said in his nightly address on November 7 that he was open to talks with Russia, but only \"genuine\" negotiations that would restore Ukraine's borders, grant it compensation for Russian attacks, and punish those responsible for war crimes.\n\nZelenskiy signed a decree on October 4 formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"impossible\" but leaving the door open to talks with Russia.\n\nSullivan told a public event in New York that the Biden administration had \"an obligation to pursue accountability\" and pledged to work with international partners to \"hold the perpetrators of grave and grotesque war crimes in Ukraine responsible for what they have done.\"\n\nSullivan did not elaborate on the communication channels that Washington and Moscow maintained, but insisted that U.S. officials were \"clear-eyed about who we are dealing with,\" the BBC reported.\n\nSullivan travelled to Kyiv on November 4 and pledged Washington's \"unwavering and unflinching\" support for Ukraine.\n\nHis unannounced visit coincided with an announcement the same day by the U.S. Defense Department of another shipment of weapons to Ukraine worth $400 million.\n\n\"I was just in Kyiv on Friday and I had the opportunity to meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy and my counterpart Andriy Yermak, with the military leadership and also to get a briefing on just what level of death and devastation has been erupted by Putin's war on that country,\" Sullivan was quoted by the BBC as saying on November 7.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the U.S. media reports.\n\n\"I've seen those reportings. So, you know -- and, look, people claim a lot of things about conversations that we -- that the United States has or doesn't have,\" Jean-Pierre told a news briefing on November 7. \"I don't have any specific conversations to read out to you.\"\n\nThe secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said on November 8 that the \"main condition\" for the resumption of negotiations with Russia would be the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nDanilov said on Twitter that Ukraine also needed the \"guarantee\" of modern air defenses, aircraft, tanks, and long-range missiles.\n\nAccording to the report in The Wall Street Journal, Sullivan held confidential conversations in recent months with Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev that were not disclosed publicly.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on November 7 that while Russia remained \"open\" to talks, it was unable to negotiate with Kyiv due to its refusal to hold talks with Russia.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters",

                "cc_text": "On October 10, Iranian loitering munitions rained over Ukraines urban centers, including Kiev. Two weeks later, Israeli forces struck an Iranian drone factory in Syria ( Al Arabiya , October 23). This demonstrated how Irans drone program is now beyond Iran, both in terms of production and operational impact. Iran has become a drone-exporting nation and Iranian drones are creating new flashpoints in different geopolitical axes.\n\nTehrans drone program is hardly new, however. In fact, it dates back to the 1980s war of attrition with Iraq and rests on a decades-long significant research and development (R&D) effort. Irans unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) strategy is aggressive ( Farsi Al Arabiya , April 23, 2021). It mainly focuses on utilizing UAVs to support the governments capabilities and strengthen its proxy forces abroad. Led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its drone-maker Qods Aviation Industries (QAI), some of Irans existing drone technologies are developed from reverse-engineering Western systems that have crashed or landed on or near Iranian territory (including the ones allegedly intercepted or captured near its coast). For example, some of the Iranian governments most sophisticated systems, including the Shahed-141 and 191, are modeled after the American RQ-171 Sentinel UAV that crashed in Iran back in late 2011 ( Iran Press , December 16, 2020).\n\nComplementing Irans proxy warfare, these drones have also been provided to the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. As a result, Iranian drones have proliferated Middle Eastern battlefields. Although open-source intelligence on the specifics on Irans drone strategy is limited, Tehran has certainly developed a large-scale domestic production base with a rapid production-manufacturing cycle. Irans current portfolio includes even an advanced suicide drone (Arash-2) that can strike Tel Aviv, which would pose an imminent threat to the West ( Tehran Times , September 12).\n\nIranian drones are proliferating rapidly and this trend is not limited to the Ukrainian battlefield. Successfully curtailing Tehrans rise as a drone exporter will not only depend on boosting counter-drone capabilities, but also drawing a detailed map of Irans global military-industrial network. This network is prominent in the developing world and fragile states, which the West will have to keep on its radar.\n\nIrans Alternative Drone Markets in Conflict Zones\n\nIn the past, Iran has successfully inserted itself into conflict zones and fragile states by providing its military systems to proxies. Iranian drone systems have proved to be high-value strategic assets for Tehrans proxy allies, especially Hezbollah, which changed the power dynamics in their favor in asymmetrical conflicts against, for example, Israel. The fact that Iranian drones are also now in Venezuelan bases is another alarming factor for U.S counterterrorism strategy. Iran and Venezuela have signed a 20-year cooperation roadmap, which likely includes exchanges in drone production. Their military-strategic relations are improving fast, as exemplified by the approximately 80 Iranian defense companies which participated in the Iran-Venezuela Industrial Scientific Expo fair in Caracas between September 16-19 ( Dialogo Americas , October 25).\n\nThe factors propelling the Iranian militarys industrial complex, and specifically its drone systems, are not limited to finding rogue clients. Another important aspect is the international production facilities of the Iranian government. In the past decade, Iran has built drone manufacturing factories and maintenance facilities in conflict-ridden and fragile states and developing countries, including Venezuela, Syria and, most recently, Tajikistan. The factory in Dushanbe is particularly crucial because it marks the first official and open announcement of an international Iranian UAV production line ( Eurasia Daily Monitor , June 14). It is also a significant step that shows Iran is striving to expand its footprint in Central Asia and saturate the regional market with its own UAV solutions before Turkey or other NATO allies are able to do the same. Tajikistans potential purchase of Iranian drones would directly escalate tensions in the region, especially vis--vis Turkeys ally, Kyrgyzstan. As Kyrgyzstan hosts a Turkish TB-2 base and is a fresh customer for the Turkish produced Akinci UAV bomber, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan share significant military-strategic ties that cause concern for Iran, if not also Irans ally, Russia ( Anadolu Agency , September 13).\n\nAfter Tajikistan, the Iranian drones have also entered the Armenian market. In short, this demonstrates Tehran is using drone sales to assert influence in the broader Central Asian and Turkic region and position itself as an alternate option to Turkish drone solutions that are becoming increasingly popular in the region, especially after their success in the Second Karabakh War, which featured Turkeys ally, Azerbaijan, defeating Irans ally, Armenia, largely because of Azerbaijans UAV dominance ( Hetq , October 20). Having Iranian drones crop up on NATOs doorstep is not only a threat to Turkey and its regional allies, but a threat to the collective security of the Transatlantic Alliance. The most imminent strategic risk is that without the restrictions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran can now purchase and sell conventional weaponry, including drones, which opens up the path for Iran to become a rival to Western and Transatlantic countries for military exports.\n\nRussias Route to Using Iranian Drones\n\nRussia is using Iranian drones to enrich its strike package, but the loitering munitions it purchases are mainly motivated by a simple cost-benefit analysis. With a price estimated around $20,000 per unit, Tehrans \"kamikaze drones\" are much cheaper than missiles while also carrying out their tasks perfectly well to destroy Ukrainian critical national infrastructure. Iranian Shahed-136s (known as Geran-2 in Russian) have been instrumental in Russias attacks on Ukraines major cities, including Kiev and Odessa, which the Russian Armed Forces failed to occupy through ground assaults. With Russian missile stocks running low (13% left of the Iskanders and approximately 45% left of the Kh-101 and Kh-555 missiles, which has forced Russia to use emergency stocks), Iranian drones provide Russia with a swift and effective alternative ( Pravda , October 24).\n\nSimple to manufacture and cheap to purchase, Iranian loitering munitions might help Russia sustain a higher assault tempo. Yet, the payload of these systems is not sufficient to completely destroy large-scale targets, such as bridges or factories. For such strikes, ballistic and cruise missiles are still key. However, the Iranian loitering munitions can still paralyze Ukraines public services and force the Ukrainian government to expend resources to repair damaged infrastructure all while the drones terrorize the local population in the process. In short, Irans loitering munitions are doing their job.\n\nOpen-source intelligence indicates that Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 loitering munitions from Iran ( Pravda , October 11). According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian Armed Forces conducted approximately 30 kamikaze strikes in a two-day period in late October, despite 23 being shot down by Ukraine ( Twitter/@kyivindependent , October 28). Besides the famed loitering munition Shahed-136, Russia might soon welcome new Iranian drones into its arsenal. In July, a Russian delegation visited Irans Kashan Air Base to see the Shahed-191 and Shahed-129, which suggests that the Kremlin is also potentially interested in these systems ( Radio Farda , July 16). The former comes with a twin-missile support, allegedly has a maximum range of 1500 kilometers, and has a flight duration of 4.5 hours, while the latter allegedly has a payload of 400 kilograms ( Iran Press , January 27, 2021).\n\nSome Ukrainian news outlets have also claimed that Russia might soon purchase the Meraj-521, which is the Iranian analogue of the U.S. firm AeroVironments Switchblade 300 ( Sundries , October 20). According to the same sources, the new batch of Russian orders may include the Arash-2 drone, which are UAVs equipped with optical and thermal cameras that the Shahed-136 lacks. While the Shahed-136 can carry a combat payload of 40 kilograms, the Arash-2 can carry approximately 272 kilograms of explosives, making it a much deadlier asset than the Shahed-136 ( Sundries , October 27).\n\nYet, the use of kamikaze drones to hit high-value targets is not a new phenomenon for Iranian drones. Some of Irans drones, including the Shahed-136 that is used in Ukraine and the Shahed-131, have both been used by the Houthis to strike Saudi Arabian high-value targets, Israel-affiliated cargo ships, and U.S bases in Iraq ( Fars News , December 26, 2021). But what makes Iranian drones extremely dangerous in Ukraine is that in the hands of General Sergey Surovikin, who is the new top commander of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, they can be increasingly used to launch indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population and cities. According to Ukrainian generals, around 40% of the Shahed-136s reach their target, which is not a high success ratio, but is still sufficient to cause large-scale damage, especially in urban centers ( Radio Svoboda , October 6).\n\nThe Dilemma of Defending Against Iranian Drones\n\nThe characteristics of the Iranian drones used in Ukraine involve advantages and disadvantages for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. On the positive side, they make a distinct, buzzing sound, which enables them to be detected mid-flight. Second, they are rather large for a loitering munition, which again, increases ease of detection.\n\nDue to their low flight altitude and lack of light-reflective composites, however, the Shahed-136 has a low radar and thermal signature, which makes it a struggle for air defense systems to intercept. Since Russia began using them, most Iranian loitering munitions were intercepted by the Ukrainian armed forces using anti-aircraft missiles, such as the Stinger ( Eurasian Times , October 18). However, due to the price tag attached to stinger missile systems, shooting these kamikaze drones down ends up becoming more costly than the threat itself. This makes targeting Iranian kamikazes with anti-aircraft missiles an extremely inefficient option for Ukraine.\n\nIn terms of military effectiveness, base defense systems, short to mid-range air defense systems, and electronic warfare assets are also required to create a layered air defense. At present, a layered strategy combining MANPADS, air defense systems, and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA), such as the German Gepards, seem like the ideal solution for Ukraine. Although insufficient for area defense, when used together with AAAs, systems such as NASAMS can also provide a point defense solution for defending Ukraines critical facilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nIrans drone production lines now extend beyond the countrys borders, which creates a much more complicated picture for U.S and allies counterterrorism strategies. For example, recently, Israel bombed an Iranian drone factory near the Dimas military airport in Syria as recently as October ( Haaretz , October 23). However, due to the close links and coordination between the IRGC and Iran-backed proxies, halting the transmission of Iranian drone technology, production and maintenance facilities between various host countries and proxies will necessitate more than destroying a single factory.\n\nIn several regions with a heightened threat level, such as Eastern Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and Central Asia, if not also East Africa, the demand for drone systems will only continue to grow. This is mainly because UAVs have proven themselves to be cost-effective assets that significantly change the power balance in favor of a country with limited military resources, especially in asymmetrical conflicts. When it comes to reducing or eliminating Irans drone capabilities, neutralizing the strategic masterminds within the IRGC, filling in the gaps in demand with Western solutions, especially among the Turkic states with NATO military solutions before Iran can, and killing the JCPOA for good and replacing it with a reciprocatory offensive strategy. In this regard, boosting intelligence and surveillance capabilities both on Iranian territory as well the host countries that field Iranian drones would also be key for the Wests counterterrorism strategy vis--vis Iran.",

The symbolic importance of the meeting place the same venue in which the Treaty of Westphalia was signed ending the Thirty Years War was underscored by some of the attending diplomats, who said Russias invasion challenged the world order those centuries-old accords helped establish.\n\n\"If we let that be challenged with impunity, then the foundations of the international order will start to erode and eventually crumble, and none of us can afford to let that happen,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks alongside German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.\n\nThe G-7 statement signed by each nation announced the establishment of a \"coordination mechanism\" to help Ukraine \"repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure.\" It did not set a timeline for implementation, but diplomats attending the event said it was important to act immediately given the onset of winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin \"seems to have decided if he cant seize Ukraine by force, he will try to freeze it into submission,\" Blinken told reporters at a news conference.\n\nThe meetings of ministers from the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada and Italy also included discussions on providing Ukraine sophisticated air defense systems to fend off volleys of Russian missile and drone strikes, officials said.\n\nThe decision to fortify Ukraines infrastructure followed a remote video briefing from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday that was disrupted by a blackout due to chronic energy shortages.\n\nOnce the connection was reestablished, Kuleba finished updating the countries on the extensive damage done to Ukraines infrastructure by Iranian-provided drones and appealed for more global support and pressure on Russia. Forty percent of Ukraines power system has been damaged by Russian attacks that have left 4.5 million people throughout the country without power, including 450,000 residents in Kyiv.\n\n\"They discussed what needs Ukraine was facing as it heads into the winter,\" said a senior State Department official who, like some others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations surrounding the war. \"Thats something that will be a core focus of this group in the days and weeks ahead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA French official said the West is focused on how it can help the inhabitants of Ukrainian towns survive the winter, by providing generators, fuel and spare parts to areas struggling to meet their energy and heating needs.\n\nThe discussion came at what could be another inflection point for the war. While some U.S. officials question Ukraines ability to completely oust Russia from occupied areas, Ukrainian forces continue to make battlefield gains, including around the southern city of Kherson, which Russia has occupied for months.\n\nThe next few weeks there are expected to be dynamic, a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal assessments, said this week. Russian military leaders have withdrawn to the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, outside Kherson, leaving rank-and-file troops to face Ukrainian assaults. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Thursday that Ukraine \"certainly\" has the capability to take back all territory west of the river.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon disclosed that it will pay to refurbish 45 Czech T-72 tanks and send them to Ukraine, part of a new $400 million military aid package that also includes drones, air defense missiles, riverine boats and money to refurbish M1117 armored vehicles. The Netherlands will also pay to refurbish and send an additional 45 Czech tanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWork is ongoing to send Ukraine other weapons, both from the United States and allies in Europe. Ukraine is expected to need a significant amount of artillery going forward as it launches between 4,000 and 7,000 rounds per day, the U.S. defense official said, putting the Russian figure at about 20,000.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn Germany, the group of democracies strongly warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine and rejected Moscows claims that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a \"dirty bomb.\"\n\n\"Russias irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable,\" the statement said. \"Any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences.\"\n\nRussias claims about a dirty bomb first emerged late last month, triggering phone calls among U.S. officials, allies and Russian leaders. Concerns about the issue have \"tamped down a bit\" since then, the U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe unease over Russias nuclear rhetoric was evident Friday in Beijing, where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Chinas president, Xi Jinping, to use his \"influence\" over Putin to help resolve the war. Xi said nations should \"oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,\" but he called the international situation \"complex\" and urged all nations to \"exercise rationality and restraint.\"\n\nReacting to Xis remarks, Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said she was \"pleased to hear\" an important ally of Russia send a \"very important signal\" against the potential use of nuclear weapons. \"Russia,\" she said, \"is totally isolated.\"\n\nStill, Scholzs trip to China has divided Western countries, some of whom have complained that Germany is repeating the mistakes it made ahead of the war in Ukraine by becoming overly dependent on the business of an authoritarian regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile U.S. and British officials have raised concerns about the visit, the first by a G-7 leader since Xi cemented his power at the ruling-party congress, other Western officials have warned against taking an explicitly antagonistic approach to Beijing.\n\n\"It is clear that China is becoming much more assertive, much more on a self-reliant course,\" Josep Borrell, the European Unions foreign policy chief, told reporters at the G-7. \"But for the time being, many member states have a strong economic relationship with China, and I dont think we can put China and Russia on the same level.\"\n\nIn the negotiated G-7 statement, the countries said they aim for \"constructive cooperation with China\" but also warned Beijing against trying to resolve disputes through \"threats, coercion, intimidation, or the use of force.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting comes as G-7 nations finalize the details of a price cap on Russian oil. The unprecedented plan could deprive Russia of oil revenue critical to funding the Kremlins war machine. But the complex arrangement also runs the risk of increasing gas prices.\n\nWhen asked whether he could assure that the move would not increase gas prices, Blinken said that \"well see how this plays out\" but that he believed the plan under negotiation would keep enough energy on the market while reducing revenue to the Kremlin.\n\nOn Friday, G-7 countries held meetings on challenges that Central Asian countries are facing as a result of the war in Ukraine. They are also focusing on collaboration with African countries on climate change, the coronavirus, and food and energy security, the U.S. official said.\n\nLamothe reported from Washington.

                "cc_text": "Russias most recent invasion of Ukraine on February 24 triggered the largest conflict in Europe since World War II with devastating and enduring humanitarian and economic consequences. According to the United Nations, it has forced nearly one-third of Ukrainians from their homes (dispersing 7.8 million refugees throughout Europe and displacing 6.2 million internally) and killed or injured more than 16,000 civilians. (The UN notes actual casualty numbers likely are considerably higher.) The war has destroyed at least $127 billion of the nations buildings and other infrastructure, according to the Kyiv School of Economics. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that Ukraines GDP will decline 35% this year. Inflation is running at more than 20%, in large part because the government is relying on the central bank to finance its budget deficit.\n\nUkraines alliesincluding members of the European Union (EU) and the United Stateshave provided billions of dollars worth of military assistance and humanitarian relief. In May, President Biden signed a $40 billion package of assistance into law, and he signed an additional $12.3 billion package of assistance into law in September. The administration was aiming to disburse $13 billion of economic assistance in 2022.\n\nEven as Ukraine continues its efforts to reclaim territory occupied by Russia, the Ukrainian government and those of its allies, as well as international financial institutions and think tanks around the world, are planning the governance and financing of its recovery in the months immediately after the war and its longer-term reconstruction and modernization. Though the duration of the war remains uncertain, all parties believe now is the time to begin planning for Ukraines future.\n\nThis background paper summarizes various proposals for organizing the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The governments of Ukraine and donor countries are currently discussing a \"coordination platform\" for aid.\n\nReconstruction Planning\n\nSoon after the invasion, the governments of Ukraine and its allies, international financial institutions, and non-governmental policy and research organizations began developing economic reconstruction plans of varying degrees of detail and with widely varying estimates of the funding needs:\n\nOther institutions have provided emergency assistance and suggested they would contribute to post-war reconstruction. The IMF has disbursed $2.7 billion in emergency support so far and set up an account for donor countries to channel aid to Ukraine. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved two support packages totaling nearly 2.3 billion and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has provided 2 billion of immediate relief.\n\nIn July, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) launched a Ukraine Economic Reconstruction Commission to create a framework for the reforms necessary for Ukraine to attract private investment. And organizations ranging from GLOBSEC, a think tank based in Bratislava, Slovakia, to the international management consulting firm Deloitte have weighed in.\n\nA conference of donors was held in Lugano, Switzerland, in July. Another is scheduled for 2023 in the United Kingdom. In October, the European Commission and Germany, as president of the Group of Seven, hosted an \"international expert conference\" on reconstruction in Berlin.\n\nReconstruction Principles\n\nPlans published so far have much in common. They largely agree that:\n\nThe overarching goal of reconstruction should be to transform Ukraines economy and society by modernizingnot only its infrastructure, but also its economic, political, and social institutions, thus providing a decisive break from Ukraines Soviet past and paving the way for it to join the EU. Several plans use the phrase \"build back better.\"\n\nUkrainians should take the lead in setting priorities for reconstruction and implementing it. Ukrainian representation should be diverse, including both national and local government officials, as well as leaders from civil society and the private sector.\n\nDonor countries and institutions should rigorously and cooperatively oversee their reconstruction assistance to ensure the programs goals are achieved and Ukraines endemic corruption thwarted. Essential elements of effective oversight include transparent procurement and financial management processes, clear achievement mileposts, and independent oversight and auditing mechanisms.\n\nReconstruction will take timeseveral plans mention 10 yearsbut continuing assistance indefinitely would undermine Ukraines ability to achieve self-sufficiency. Assistance, at least in the early stages of reconstruction, should be primarily in the form of grants to avoid saddling Ukraine with unmanageable debt.\n\nReconstruction Coordination\n\nThe plans also agree that, to avoid working at cross purposes and to ensure effective oversight, donors must coordinate the administration of their reconstruction assistance. But the plans differ significantly on how that coordination should be structured and who should lead it.\n\nThe Marshall Planthe U.S. program from 1947 to 1951 to rebuild Europe after the devastation of World War IIis often cited as an inspiration for the reconstruction of Ukraine, but administratively it was the opposite of the current situation. One nationthe United Stateswas the donor, and 16 European countries were the recipients. With Ukraine, one nation will be the recipient, and many nations and international institutions will be the donorsposing a coordination challenge.\n\nViews on administering assistance and coordinating among donors vary. The World Bank established a multi-donor trust fund. The IMF is developing a new monitoring instrument (called Program Monitoring with Board Involvement).\n\nThe European Commission calls for an \"international coordination platform,\" co-led by the Commission and the Ukrainian government. The details for such a platform are the subject of ongoing negotiations between the Commission, the Ukrainian government, and members of the G7. (The members are the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, plus the EU.)\n\nCEPR proposes to manage assistance through a new stand-alone agency created or authorized by the EU. The IMF and World Bank could provide technical assistance butbecause some of their member nations may not be interested in seeing Ukraine succeed economicallyshould not administer the aid, according to the CEPR.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States suggests that the G7 should take the lead in partnership with the Ukrainian government, while allowing opportunities for the participation of non-G7 countries such as Australia. According to GMF, the coordination effort should be headed initially by \"an American with a global stature.\"\n\nThe Plans, So Far\n\nUkraines National Recovery Plan\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal presented the plan at the Lugano conference, July 4-5.\n\nFunding and Timeline: The 10-year plan is divided into two phases, 2023-2025 and 2026-2032, and encompasses 850 wide-ranging projects requiring funding totaling an estimated $750 billion.\n\nPriorities: The two biggest components of the plan are the reconstruction and modernization of housing and infrastructure ($150 billion to $250 billion; 103 projects and activities) and expanding logistical and transportation facilities (airports, railroads, roads, ports) and integrating them with the EU ($120 billion to $160 billion; 145 projects and activities). Other big-ticket items include achieving energy independence and developing green energy ($130 billion; 21 projects and activities), ensuring access to funding through insurance, loan guarantees, and other programs ($75 billion; 21 projects and activities), and supporting high-tech and other potentially fast-growing economic sectors ($50 billion; 34 projects and activities).\n\nDonor Coordination: The plan does not include a specific donor coordination structure, but Ukraine subsequently circulated a proposal to create a recovery fund with a supervisory board on which three-quarters of the seats would be held by representatives of donors.\n\nOversight: The plan asserts that strengthening Ukrainian institutions and \"de-oligarchization\" are its \"fundamental prerequisites\"including public data transparency, relaunching anti-corruption offices, reforming law enforcement agencies, implementing corporate governance legislation, and synchronizing anti-trust practices with the EU.\n\nThe European Commission: RebuildUkraine Plan\n\nThe overarching goal of the European Commissions RebuildUkraine plan, published May 18, is the creation of \"a free and prosperous country, anchored in European values, well integrated into the European and global economy.\"\n\nFunding and Timeline: When the Commission issued its plan, it said the overall funding needed was not yet known, but that it would be \"substantial,\" and that reconstruction would \"potentially span more than a decade.\" In September, jointly with the World Bank and the government of Ukraine, it estimated the cost of recovery and reconstruction as of June 1 at $349 billion and said it was expected to grow.\n\nPriorities: The plan outlines four pillars: 1) rebuilding \"infrastructure, health services, housing, and schools, as well as digital and energy resilience in line with the most recent European policies and standards\"; 2) providing administrative and technical support so that Ukraine can continue modernizing its institutions \"to ensure good governance and respect for the rule of law\"; 3) a structural and regulatory agenda in Ukraine that would deepen \"the economic and societal integration of Ukraine and its people with the EU\"; and 4) promoting Ukraines \"green and digital transition\" through sustainable economic competitiveness, trade, and private-sector development.\n\nDonor Coordination: The Commission envisions an international coordination platform co-led by it and the Ukrainian government. It would serve as \"an overarching and single-entry point for all actions on the reconstruction of Ukraine\" and would work with EU member states, other countries, and international financial institutions. The platform would determine priorities for financing and specific projects for implementing priorities. It would coordinate financing sources and monitor progress. The plan calls for the creation of a RebuildUkraine Facility, embedded in the EU budget, to serve as the legal instrument for providing EU grants and loans.\n\nOversight: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said investments in Ukraine will \"go hand in hand with reforms that will support Ukraine in pursuing its European path.\" The plan did not detail specific oversight mechanisms but said the RebuildUkraine Facility \"would put significant emphasis on good governance, the rule of law, sound financial management as well as anti-corruption and anti-fraud proofing.\"\n\nThe World Bank: Relief, Recovery and Resilient Reconstruction\n\nThe World Bank staff, in a paper published April 21, wrote that during reconstruction \"Ukraine will have the opportunity to finally shake off some of the legacies of the past and leapfrog to a more productive, sustainable and inclusive society.\" This requires not just rebuilding housing and infrastructure, they wrote, but also \"institutions that enable building a dynamic economy anchored in Ukraines strong commitment to become a member of the European Union.\"\n\nFunding and Timeline: The paper divided economic assistance into three phases: relief during the war, recovery during the first six-to-eight months after the war, and \"resilient reconstruction\" in \"the medium term.\" Jointly with the European Commission and the government of Ukraine, the World Bank in September estimated recovery and reconstruction needs at $349 billion and growing as of June 1. The paper identified \"three critical pathways\" for transfer of resources from abroad: grants through the World Bank and IMF; loans at below-market rates and for extended terms; and donor-country guarantees of loans from international financial institutions.\n\nPriorities: The plan enumerated \"four critical directions\" for reconstruction: 1) fundamentally reforming Ukraines public finances and financial sector, including through a lower and more fairly applied tax rate and less dependence on domestic banks; 2) stimulating entry and growth of new technologically advanced businesses to take advantage of trading opportunities with the EU; 3) rebuilding public social services, especially a high-quality education system and a network of health facilities; and 4) building sustainable energy, transportation and other infrastructure that aligns with the EUs \"green deal.\"\n\nDonor Coordination: The paper notes the World Banks multi-donor trust fund and an IMF-administered account as vehicles for assistance and mentions that \"a critical need for Ukraines external partners is to closely coordinate all their resources.\"\n\nOversight: The report does not describe specific oversight mechanisms but calls for technical support to strengthen Ukraines anti-corruption agencies and reviving efforts to ensure Ukraines judiciary is professional, non-corruptible, and fair.\n\nThe Centre for Economic Policy Research: A Blueprint for the Reconstruction of Ukraine[1]\n\nCEPR, a network of research economists, many at European universities, published its plan early in the war, on April 8, with the hope that it would lead to a broader project with a deeper analysis of how best to reconstruct Ukraine. It said international assistance should put Ukraine on the path to joining the EU, should be rapid but conditioned on accountability and milestones, and should focus on grants rather than loans because a country destroyed by war cannot be expected to repay additional debts. It said donors should closely coordinate assistance with each other and with Ukraine to minimize waste and delay and that Ukrainians (including at the local level) should \"own\" reconstruction by matching a fraction of the aid and be able to continue projects after international assistance ends.\n\nFunding and Timeline: Like other plans, it divides reconstruction into three post-war phases: the emergency response (the first 6 months, akin to the response to a natural disaster), restoration of critical infrastructure and services (3 to 24 months); and laying the foundation for future growth and modernization (medium- to longer-term). It estimates reconstruction costs at 200 billion to 500 billion but warned that costs were increasing as the war continued and could cumulate as high as $1 trillion. It identified several potential sources of financing, including grants, loans, and loan-guarantees from allied governments; multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, EBRD, and European Investment Bank; private foundations and individuals; and seized Russian assets.\n\nPriorities: Reconstruction, according to the CEPR paper, offers \"a unique opportunity to radically upgrade Ukraines productive capacity to bring it close to the technological frontier, [and] lay foundations for long-term growth.\" The success of aid will depend on Ukraines ability to export to the EU, it said, so should come with incentives for Ukraine to align its regulatory and legal environment with the EUs. And it should encourage and facilitate inflows of foreign capital and technology transfers by subsidizing and insuring investments and by privatizing Ukraines two large state-owned banks. A key to modernization, the authors write, will be replacing the remnants of Ukraines Soviet past with a \"liberal economic framework\" that includes reforming its tax code and labor laws, giving more political and economic authority to local governments, and removing remaining restrictions on land ownership. Infrastructure improvements should include robust transportation connections (railroads, highways, pipelines, and bridges) and rebuilt housing, hospitals, and schools to attract displaced Ukrainians back to their pre-war residences. Energy investments should focus on integrating Ukraine into the European energy network and reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nDonor Coordination: The paper notes that a self-standing U.S. agency successfully administered the Marshall Plan after World War II and recommends establishing an independent EU-affiliated agency. It would coordinate Ukraine assistance across diverse aid sources and function as a \"single interlocuter\" with Ukrainian authorities. An independent agency would minimize the political influence of Russia, which is a shareholder in the IMF, World Bank, and EBRD, the authors write. The governance structure of the agency should be \"technocratic in nature\" and include Ukraine. To avoid creating an entrenched bureaucracy, the agency should be authorized with sunset provisions linked to Ukraine becoming a member of the EU.\n\nOversight: The independent agency should set project timelines and goals and monitor results in collaboration with Ukrainian authorities and should be able to withhold or delay funding. It should implement strong anti-corruption protocols, relying upon site visits, third-party verification, protections and financial incentives for whistleblowers, and a partnership with the European Public Prosecutors Office.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States: Designing Ukraines Recovery in the Spirit of the Marshall Plan[2]\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States, a U.S.-based think tank founded through a gift from the German government to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, looks to history for inspiration for Ukraines reconstruction in the plan published September 7. It draws six lessons: 1) to deliver hope to Ukrainians during the war, planning should begin now for a prosperous, secure future; 2) U.S. officials must work hard to win both broad public support and strong bipartisan congressional backing for assistance to Ukraine; 3) Ukraine should lead its own reconstruction, but donors must approve the plans and monitor implementation; 4) assistance should be delivered in an accountable and transparent framework and progress from humanitarian relief to economic recovery and modernization; 5) the underlying goal must be economic integration with Europe; and 6) assistance should be time-limited and carefully coordinated among donors. GMF draws a seventh lesson from Ukraines recent past: Donors should closely involve Ukraines non-governmental organizations, which have emerged as trusted watchdogs, to ensure the integrity of the governments anti-corruption agencies are maintained.\n\nFunding and Timeline: A paper published by the GMF in September cites the Ukrainian governments $750 billion reconstruction cost estimate and 10-year timeline but does not offer its own, because \"the fog of war lies thick over Ukraine, and the total costs of the conflict are hidden in the mist.\" Recovery should consist of four stages: relief, reconstruction, modernization, and accession to the EU. It said donors should weight their contributions toward grants rather than loans because Ukraine will not be \"investable\" soon. Sovereign guarantees for private investments should be introduced and, in time, using seized Russian assets should be considered, it said.\n\nPriorities: The paper does not recommend specific priorities for investments and instead focuses on a structure (a task force with sectoral working groups) for Ukraine and its international partners to determine funding needs and set priorities.\n\nDonor Coordination: The GMF paper asserts that the European Commission has \"neither the necessary political nor the financial heft\" to lead reconstruction. And it advises against creating a new agency or centralized trust fund. Instead, it suggests that the G7 and Ukraine together appoint \"an American of global stature\" as recovery coordinator \"because only the United States will be able to bring together the needed global coalition and forge consensus among Ukraines partners.\" The coordinator, in turn, would build a Ukraine Reconstruction and Recovery Task Force. Each G7 country would appoint a senior representative to the task force. The EU, as a G7 member, would serve as the secretariat and convenor of the task force, which would rely on European Commission staff. The task force would form sectoral working groups (such as agriculture, infrastructure, housing, energy, water, sanitation, and industrial capacity) co-led by G7 and Ukrainian officials. International financial and multilateral institutions, philanthropic organizations, and large private-sector leaders could apply to be members of, or observers to, the task force.\n\nOversight: According to the paper, \"aid to Ukraine needs to come with strings attached,\" given the countrys history of corruption. The first tranche of reconstruction funds should be contingent on Ukraine implementing rule-of-law and judicial reforms. The EU should invite Ukraine to join the European Public Prosecutors Office. An independent inspector general should be appointed to investigate misconduct and ensure efficient use of funds. And the task force should create a digital platform to promptly publish as many reconstruction-related documents as possible.\n\nOther Participants and Views\n\nInternational Monetary Fund: The IMF has disbursed two rounds of emergency financial support to Ukraine$1.4 billion in March and $1.3 billion in October. In April, the IMF set up an \"administered account\" for donor countries to channel aid to Ukraine. As of mid-September, Canada and Germany had provided $2.2 billion through it, and Belgium and the Netherlands planned to use it. The IMF has also begun developing a new instrument\"Program Monitoring with Board Involvement\"to validate the Ukrainian governments projections and to administer \"a full-fledged IMF program once conditions allow,\" according to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. Its goal is to work with Ukrainian authorities on \"a comprehensive macroeconomic framework, with policy undertakings and quantitative targets, that will clarify external financing needs and provide a guide for both domestic policymaking and international support,\" she said.\n\nEuropean Investment Bank: The EIB, the EUs lending arm, approved two lending packages for Ukraine668 million in March and 1.59 billion in Julyto meet urgent needs, including the repair of the most essential damaged infrastructure. (The loans were guaranteed by the EU.) EIB President Werner Hoyer promised in October that the bank would continue to support Ukraine \"for the reconstruction of a free, prosperous country.\"\n\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development: The EBRDowned by 72 countries, the EU, and the EIBwas founded in 1991 to create a post-Cold War era in central and eastern Europe. Since the invasion began, the EBRD has committed more than 1 billion in loans and aims to triple that by the end of 2023, primarily to maintain energy and food security, restore rail infrastructure, and support the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies: CSIS, a non-profit policy research organization based in Washington, D.C. and focused on national security issues, in July launched a bipartisan and international Ukraine Reconstruction Commission. It is led by three co-chairs: Paula J. Dobriansky, former under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration; Greg Page, former chief executive officer and chair of Cargill, a global food corporation; and Michael Polsky, founder and chief executive officer of Invenergy, a multinational power generation company. The commission aims to \"produce a framework for the crucial reforms needed to attract private-sector investment to support Ukraines economic reconstruction.\" It will seek to align its work with Ukraines National Recovery Plan and aims to produce a series of policy papers on specific topics, such as agriculture, energy, transportation and logistics, and corruption.\n\nGLOBSEC: GLOBSEC, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bratislava, Slovakia, established a Ukraine Support Council in September, chaired by Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, former prime minister of Poland. And in October, GLOBSEC opened an office in Kyiv. The Council will focus on Ukraines accession to the European Union and the reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as its integration into Central Europe. It will provide \"tailor-made advice in the form of sets of studies and pilot projects.\" Council members will include Ukrainians, other Europeans, and Americans.\n\nDeloitte:[3] The international management consulting firm Deloitte published The reconstruction of Ukraine: Historical lessons for postwar reconstruction of Ukraine in October. It said reconstruction \"is more than just rebuilding roads and factories\" but should help Ukraine \"reemerge a stronger country that is part of a stronger Europe.\" It identified five areas as starting points for reconstruction: physical infrastructure, education and workforce, the financial sector, government services and revenue, and agriculture. It did not recommend a specific structure for overseeing and coordinating international assistance but said it should be done by \"a single central institution.\" That institution could be \"a single nation, a multilateral organization, or any number of other organizational structures,\" it said, adding, \"involvement and leadership from the United States and the EU are key.\"\n\n[1] The authors are Stephen Lewarne, Nell Todd, Joe Mariani, Joniel Sung-Jin Cha, and Stuart Williamson.\n\n[2] The authors are Ronja Ganster, Jacob Kirkegaard, Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, and Bruce Stokes.\n\n[3] The authors are Torbjrn Becker, Stockholm School of Economics; Barry Eichengreen and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, University of California-Berkeley; Sergei Guriev, Sciences Po; Simon Johnson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Tymofiy Mylovanov, Kyiv School of Economics; Kenneth Rogoff, Harvard University; and Beatrice Weder di Mauro, Graduate Institute Geneva.\n\nThe Brookings Institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations, corporations, governments, individuals, as well as an endowment.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has continued making gains on the battlefield and so far maintained the support of the international community, including the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost spoke to experts on the region to explore the options available to both countries and how outside factors, including the outcome of Tuesdays midterm elections in the U.S., could impact the trajectory of the war.\n\nAn expert warned that ending the war likely won't be simple. Illustration:Jianan Liu/HuffPost Photo:Getty Images\n\nIs A Negotiated Settlement Still Possible?\n\nEarlier this year, Russia and Ukraine held peace talks, originally in Belarus and later in Turkey, igniting hope that an agreement was within reach.\n\nHowever, those talks collapsed in mid-May, in part as a result of Russias insistence on keeping control of large parts of Ukraine. Ukraine felt more confident after managing to reclaim territory in the north and anticipating more weapons and financial support from the U.S. and other countries, according to The New York Times. Ukrainians were also motivated by a sense of outrage over Russias cruel actions, including the atrocities uncovered in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, where images of bodies burned and with their hands tied made headlines around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as we head into the winter months, the question persists: Is a negotiated settlement between the two countries still possible?\n\nLiana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said thats \"unlikely at this stage.\"\n\nFix said Putins decision to annex four regions of Ukraine Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia after holding \"referenda\" widely condemned by both Ukraine and the West has decreased the odds of a deal. Moscows desire to use the annexations as a precondition for any type of agreement will be a non-starter for Ukraine, especially given the successes it has had on the battlefield, Fix explained.\n\n\"There is also a major concern that Russia will use any talks as a pause to regroup and replenish its forces for a new offensive in the spring, as there is so far no indication that Russia has changed its maximalist war aims and would be satisfied with only limited territorial gains,\" Fix said.\n\nZachary Witlin, a senior analyst for Eurasia Group, added that when peace talks started in March, Russia enjoyed battlefield momentum. That has since changed, meaning that \"Ukraine has less reason to make concessions,\" Witlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For us, this war could only end with restoring Ukraine as a sovereign state in sovereign borders, because any other result, for us, will be just some kind of prelude to the next Russian attempt of conquest.\" - Victor Tregubov, captain of Ukraines armed forces\n\nAt the time, Ukraine appeared willing to accept neutrality as long as it received concrete security guarantees, according to reports about the terms under discussion. Meanwhile, Russia wanted to keep control of Ukrainian territory it had seized in 2014 and that was even before the latest annexations.\n\n\"We can only see something go forward if Russia changes its demand,\" Witlin said. \"But more broadly, its not clear to me that its acceptable for any Ukrainian leader, who would face elections in the future and have to explain it to to the general public, that they would essentially surrender territory to Russia.\"\n\nWitlin added that Ukrainians would want to receive reparations to reconstruct their country and see some post-war justice system established to punish those responsible for the war crimes committed by Moscow.\n\nWitlin also addressed commentary within the U.S. that theres not enough being done to encourage peace talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Its certainly possible that the U.S., Europe and those providing Ukraine weaponry could play a role in shaping that deal,\" Witlin said. \"But the deal cant stick if theres not some minimal level of acceptability to both Kyiv and Moscow.\"\n\nWhat Happens If The Two Countries Cant Negotiate A Peace Plan?\n\nBoth sides could first agree to a cease-fire agreement, potentially leading to a peace plan later on.\n\nThis is something the two countries have tried before.\n\nWitlin pointed to the two Minsk cease-fire agreements reached in 2014 and 2015, which were signed as a way to end a conflict in Eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists that started after Russia illegally annexed Crimea.\n\nThe 2015 agreement, Minsk II, was supported by France and Germany, as well as Russia and Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\nThe deal mandated a cease-fire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. It was also \"a major diplomatic coup for the Kremlin, obliging Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges,\" according to The Associated Press. This, in turn, would help Moscow exert control over Ukrainian politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while that agreement ended active-phase fighting, it was never fully implemented. Tensions remained, and Ukrainians never embraced it.\n\nPutins decision to recognize the independence of two regions days before he invaded Ukraine further undermined Minsk II, which French President Emmanuel Macron had said was the \"only path on which peace can be built.\"\n\nUnder current circumstances, when Ukraine has shown it is capable of defending itself and fighting back against Russian forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be hesitant to accept something similar.\n\nIf the two sides never come to a negotiated settlement or cease-fire agreement, the war could develop into a so-called frozen conflict, where the active phase of the war would end, but with no agreement between the two parties.\n\n\"Im not sure that thats the most likely outcome in this case, because the costs for both Ukraine and Russia are just so enormously higher than at any point since 2014, when this conflict began,\" Witlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Could The U.S. Midterm Elections Affect The War?\n\nThere have been signs that the bipartisan support Ukraine has enjoyed in the U.S. will cease to exist if Republicans win back the House in Tuesdays midterm elections.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.) recently said he wont hand out \"a blank check to Ukraine\" if Republicans control the chamber, as the U.S. public will want to prioritize domestic issues, including persistent inflation and a looming recession.\n\nCongress has played a major role in backing Ukraine. It approved $12.3 billion in emergency funding in September on top of the $54 billion the U.S. sent to the country in previous packages, according to The New York Times. If the U.S. were to completely stop backing Ukraine, the country \"would likely be militarily defeated by Russia,\" Fix said.\n\nMost U.S. lawmakers are broadly supportive of Ukraine, so aid probably wont come to a complete halt, Witlin said. He added that McCarthys statement likely reflected a concern shared by a minority within the two parties about where the conflict is headed next and whether U.S. support is ultimately tied to resolving it.\n\n\"After the midterm elections, I think that aid packages on balance probably are likely to start getting smaller or attempt to be more targeted,\" Witlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaved Ali, an associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, said lawmakers would also have to weigh the optics of denying support to Ukraine.\n\n\"Thats not a winning political message,\" Ali said, adding that candidates who have expressed skepticism of continuing to fund Ukraine on the campaign trail would face a different reality if they got elected.\n\nHow Is Putin Using Strikes On Ukraines Energy Infrastructure To Win The War?\n\nOne of the most unpredictable aspects of this war has been Putin himself, who has tried to use any leverage he has to gain the upper hand in the conflict.\n\nGiven Russias weaknesses on the battlefield, he has now resorted to striking Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nZelenskyy said in his Sunday address that over 4.5 million people were without power, calling Russia a \"terrorist state.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"No matter what the terrorists want, no matter what they try to achieve, we must endure this winter and be even stronger in the spring than we are now, be even more ready for the liberation of our entire territory than now,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nZelenskyy previously estimated Russias attacks destroyed over 30% of Ukraines energy power stations since Oct. 10, adding that these actions have left \"no space\" for negotiations with Putin.\n\nAnother kind of Russian terrorist attacks: targeting energy & critical infrastructure. Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraines power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country. No space left for negotiations with Putin's regime. @United24media pic.twitter.com/LN4A2GYgCK (@ZelenskyyUa) October 18, 2022\n\nPutins intention has been to put pressure on everyday Ukrainians in the hope they will eventually turn on their own leaders.\n\nBut Fix said Putins tactics are unlikely to break Ukrainians resolve, adding that the Russian leader \"continues to repeat the same mistake.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He underestimates Ukrainians and the existential nature of this war for Ukraine,\" Fix told HuffPost.\n\nAli warned these types of attacks could backfire on Russia, predicting the West will do as much as possible to help Ukrainians.\n\n\"It just reinforces the perception of who Putin is and how sort of diabolical this strategy of his is, and the list of potential war crimes keeps getting longer,\" he said.\n\nWhat Other Tactics Is Moscow Using To Pressure Ukraine Into Defeat?\n\nRussia has also struck a close relationship with Iran in recent months. The Russians have reportedly been using Iran-made drones to conduct strikes in Ukraine, and Iranian military officers are on the ground in Crimea, according to John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications at the White House.\n\nZelenskyy on Sunday said Iranian drones have been crucial to Russias efforts of attacking energy infrastructure and called for Iran to be punished for lending its support to Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The whole world will know that the Iranian regime helps Russia prolong this war, and therefore prolong the effect of those threats to the world provoked precisely by the Russian war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"If it was not for the Iranian supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now.\"\n\nThe White House has raised concerns that Russia is advising Iran on how to deal with the countrys anti-government protests.\n\nWitlin said Russias coziness to Iran is intended to send \"a broader message to Western governments about inroads that they could have to apply other sources of pressure against Western supporters around the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has tried to pressure Ukraine financially, using the U.N-brokered grain export agreement meant to address a global food crisis. Moscow said it would exit the deal indefinitely after an attack on its Black Sea fleet, which it blamed on Ukraine. Russia later recommitted to the deal after saying it received sufficient guarantees.\n\n\"Holding this threat of increasing economic damage to Ukraine is a form of retaliation that Russia has available,\" Witlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould Putin Use Nuclear Weapons To Win The War?\n\nU.S. officials reportedly have been briefed on intelligence suggesting Russian officials openly discussed the possibility of using nuclear weapons, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\nPutin has said he is prepared to use \"all available means\" to defend Russia, which was interpreted as a threat.\n\nFrederick B. Hodges, a retired lieutenant general and former top U.S. Army commander in Europe, told The New York Times he doesnt believe Russia is prepared to use nuclear weapons, adding the rhetoric is part of the Kremlins strategy.\n\n\"They are trying to put pressure on Ukraine to negotiate and cave in to the Kremlins demands,\" Hodges told the newspaper.\n\nLast week, Russia appeared to scale back that language. Its foreign ministry issued a statement saying that \"Russia is strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli said it wouldnt be in Putins interest to use nuclear weapons because of the consequences he would face.\n\n\"If Russia isnt already a pariah country, it would absolutely become one in the blink of an eye, if that were to happen,\" Ali said.\n\nUsing nuclear capabilities \"would be of grave concern even [for] Russias closest partners, such as China,\" Fix added.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and German chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly agreed during a meeting Friday that Russia would cross a line if it employed nuclear weapons, according to NPR.\n\nThe Group of Seven on Friday called Russias nuclear rhetoric \"unacceptable,\" adding that Moscows claim that Ukraine was prepared to launch a \"dirty bomb\" has been proven \"baseless\" by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Hasnt Russia Fully Used Its Cyber Capabilities To Defeat Ukraine?\n\nAnother area of intrigue around the war is why Russia hasnt been more aggressive in using its cyber capabilities since the invasion.\n\n\"I think theres some really interesting questions as to why hasnt Russia been more successful on the cyber front when they were successful at a smaller level in Ukraine\" previously, Ali said.\n\nWitlin added Russia could use cyber warfare as a form of retaliation not only against Ukraine but also against the West, which it hasnt done thus far.\n\n\"That could be crossed further in the future. And thats one that Ive been concerned about,\" Witlin said.\n\nSo How Does It End?\n\nNo one knows for sure. But a way out of this conflict might not be neat and tidy.\n\nWhile Americans seem to like a sense of finality, \"thats not a requirement for Russia,\" Witlin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Tregubov, captain of Ukraines armed forces, said the war is existential for Ukrainians and they are not prepared to give up.\n\n\"For us, this war could only end with restoring Ukraine as a sovereign state in sovereign borders, because any other result, for us, will be just some kind of prelude to the next Russian attempt of conquest,\" Tregubov told HuffPost.",

Acquire Licensing Rights Read more\n\nOBUKHIV, Ukraine, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Each time Ukrainian pensioner Halyna Halytska prepares for her hospital treatment, she is preoccupied with a single thought: Will there be enough power and water to see her through?\n\nOutages, caused by Russian air strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure, can last for hours at a time as Halytska and 27 other patients lie tied to their dialysis machines in hospital in Obukhiv, a city south of Kyiv.\n\nThe power cuts hit pumping stations - a particular worry for the patients whose treatments use hundreds of litres of running water. Medics do their best. But sometimes the pipes run dry and they have to curtail the life-saving treatments.\n\n\"It's a war and there's nothing we can do about it,\" 65-year-old Halytska said from her hospital bed.\n\nRussia stepped up attacks on power plants, substations and other targets in mid-October amid numerous battlefield setbacks following its Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that around 40% of the country's energy infrastructure has been seriously damaged.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on television that Russia was likely stockpiling missiles and drones for future strikes.\n\n'WE COULDN'T LEAVE'\n\nStable power is crucial for the patients in Obukhiv Central District Hospital, chief doctor Tetiana Tremba said.\n\nBut the outages keep coming, caused by direct strikes on infrastructure and the rolling blackouts imposed by energy providers to ease pressure on the grid and carry out repairs.\n\nShortening treatments can leave patients suffering from nausea, vomiting and other symptoms. But skipping treatment altogether is not an option. \"They cannot live without it,\" Tremba said.\n\nSometimes the impact of the war comes even closer.\n\nAmid the dull hum of the dialysis machines, Halytska recalled the time last month when Russian strikes hit nearby during her treatment.\n\n\"We couldn't do anything since we were tied up (to the equipment),\" she said. \"We couldn't leave.\"\n\nTremba was there too. \"It's such a responsibility,\" she said. \"So many people were lying here and we didn't know how it would end.\"\n\nBLACKOUTS AND GENERATORS\n\nVitalii Vlasiuk, deputy governor of the Kyiv region in charge of healthcare, said around 60 hospitals in his area had been damaged in attacks, and twice as many affected in some way by Russia's invasion.\n\nDeputy Health Minister Bohdan Borukhovskiy told Reuters officials had not recorded any deaths as a result of power cuts.\n\n\"All departments in which planned surgeries took place were provided with a minimum level of electricity needed to continue and complete the medical procedures,\" he said.\n\nBut Ukraine's hospitals did not have enough generators to cover all the outages, he added.\n\nGovernment officials working with international partners had delivered more than 400 generators to hospitals nationwide, he said. Another 1,100 were expected from a joint project with the World Bank and 170 more from the World Health Organization.\n\nThe European Commission on Wednesday proposed an 18 billion-euro financial support package for Ukraine that would include funding for Kyiv to restore critical infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, Halytska and the 27 other patients suffering from kidney diseases in the Obukhiv hospital have to lie back and wait for the next gap in the power cuts.\n\n\"Without dialysis, there is no life,\" she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Pavel Polityuk; Writing by Dan Peleschuk; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "Russia once viewed the G-20 group of leading economies as the worlds key cooperative forum. No longer. The November 15-16 meeting in Bali will not be attended by Vladimir Putin and there is therefore little chance that his isolation will be illustrated through face-to-face condemnations from Western leaders.\n\nThats not to say that Russia has no friends, just that it has fewer than before its all-out war on Ukraine began in February. North Korea, for example, has reportedly drawn closer to the Kremlin through supplies of military equipment to aid its war of aggression. And Iran, a more significant power, now enjoys a detectably stronger relationship with Russia, with serious implications for the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation, and sanctions evasion.\n\nThe sight of Iranian suicide drones striking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and the mooted arrival of Iranian ballistic missiles to bolster Russias unprovoked war on a European neighbor meanwhile shows how the Kremlin benefits (and Tehrans indifference to reputational damage.)\n\nThe warming of relations comes after decades, if not centuries of mistrust. This mutual hesitancy has been a hallmark of bilateral ties, with a sense of incompleteness always haunted their much-vaunted cooperation. Russias aggression in Ukraine and most of all its failure to produce a quick victory presented Iran with significant opportunities to exploit Russias weaknesses, and to push Putins regime to agree to more extensive cooperation in the economic and military realms. Irans nuclear ambitions likewise.\n\nBefore the war in Ukraine, Russias involvement in Irans revived talks on restoring the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) designed to end Tehrans ability to build nuclear weapons, were characterized by the US and its allies as fairly positive. On several occasions, the Kremlin pressured Iran to stay in line and abstain from making further moves toward acquiring nuclear weapons, and so kill any scant hopes of restoring the nuclear agreement.\n\nRussian calculus was clear it opposed the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, a region already beset with instability. Iran and Russia have long cooperated on numerous issues from the South Caucasus to the Caspian Sea, but the Islamic regimes nature its tradition of financing and helping to direct a variety of foreign militias and its willingness to arm the enemies of its enemies, made it risky to assist its quest for nuclear technology.\n\nThe war in Ukraine may be changing all these calculations, and theres a growing body of evidence suggesting this is already happening. First, since the first days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine when Western resolve to oppose Russia became evident, the Kremlin resorted to blackmail, threatening to scupper the JCPOA negotiations in Vienna. In June, when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supported a resolution demanding Irans cooperation with the UN, Russia voted against it. It also stayed silent when Iran switched off several IAEA cameras at the nuclear sites.\n\nRussias game is clear. It cares deeply about its war against Ukraine and is effectively asking the West how much it cares about Irans nuclear program. This potential geopolitical horse-trading fits with Putins approach to foreign affairs, but takes little account of the US-led approach. So far the West has resisted, but Russia knows that the clock is ticking Iran is getting dangerously close to the famous breakout moment when it will be impossible to reverse its progress toward nuclear weapons.\n\nGet the Latest Sign up to receive regular emails and stay informed about CEPA's work. Email\n\nAmid this growing alignment, uncertainties in Iran-Russia ties do persist. Iranians are generally skeptical about Russias strategic goals and interests in the Middle East. Even on such issues as the provision of Iranian military drones to Russia, now confirmed by the top leadership, Iranian politicians are deeply divided about aiding a very obviously amoral war of conquest. Moreover, Iranians see Russia as an imperial power that for centuries hurt their country no less than the West; ordinary Iranians opinions on Russia have largely been negative; about twice as many Iranians blame the Kremlin for the war as blame the West, despite official propaganda.\n\nYet this narrative on distrust should not be overstated. Long-term developments signal the growth in the scope of military and economic cooperation. For instance, Iran and Russia plan to expand bilateral trade and introduce the Mir payment system for commercial transactions. Trade turnover, which stood at $4bn in 2021, could reach $6bn \"in the near future\".\n\nRussia is also eager to learn how Iran has managed for decades to survive the sanctions regime. The Islamic Republic has developed an extensive network of overseas front companies to hide its trading activities from Western sanctions enforcers, with significant success.\n\nIran expects Russia to return the favor. Its air force flies decrepit combat aircraft bought many decades ago from the Soviet Union and the West. Before 2022, Russia was hesitant to provide Iran with the newest Su-35 fighter jets. Now, hints in the Iranian media indicate that Russian calculus might be changing. Moreover, on November 8 Irans Nour News Agency reported that Russias National Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev visited Tehran to arrange the purchase of Iranian ballistic missiles.\n\nIran and Russia are now unified by negatives. Both are sanctioned by the West and seek routes to evade those restrictions.\n\nOne route to achieving this would be improvements to the North-South trade route to connect Irans warm water Gulf southern ports to Russia through Azerbaijans territory. The success of the corridor is still uncertain, but the war in Ukraine and Russias changing perspective toward the Islamic Republic have encouraged the Kremlin to pay closer attention to the issue. Over the past several months, there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity between Moscow and Tehran to speed up the completion of the railway and road infrastructure. Putins July trip to Tehran covered precisely these topics.\n\nEmil Avdaliani is a professor at European University and the Director of Middle East Studies at the Georgian think-tank, Geocase.\n\nEuropes Edge is CEPAs online journal covering critical topics on the foreign policy docket across Europe and North America.

Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times\n\nArms sales have long been an important part of Russian foreign policy. But those sales were declining before the invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say that the war will probably hasten the trend.\n\nRussias performance on the battlefield has damaged its reputation as a military power, they say, and financial and export controls by the U.S. and European governments will make it that much harder for the Kremlin to present itself as a reliable long-term arms supplier for future deals.\n\n\"I dont think Russia can recover as a major arms exporter from this,\" said Ian Storey, a political scientist at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore who studies security issues in Asia. \"Not for a long time, if ever.\"\n\nRussia is still the worlds second-largest arms exporter after the United States, and its sales of air defense systems and combat aircraft to China and Egypt its second- and third-largest clients after India have risen substantially in recent years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, known as SIPRI.\n\nBut from 2017 to 2021, Russias share of the global arms export market declined by 5 percent, to 19 percent, compared with the previous four-year period, according to SIPRI data. Its exports also fell by about a quarter, primarily because of decreasing demand from India and Vietnam.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine grinds on and sanctions against Russia increase, doubts are growing about the quality of Russian weapons, as well as Moscows capacity to produce advanced weapons and provide long-term support for clients who buy them, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms researcher at SIPRI.\n\n\"Russia just doesnt have the technology base or the economy to support development of many types of new weapons and components,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts say that Southeast Asia, where Russia has traditionally been the top arms supplier, is a useful case study in the Kremlins declining prospects as an arms exporter.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, South Korea eclipsed Russia as the regions top arms supplier, providing 18 percent of the regions arms imports, according to SIPRI data. No other exporter accounted for more than 14 percent.\n\nDuring that period, South Korea sent warships to the Philippines and Thailand, submarines to Indonesia, and combat and trainer aircraft to the Philippines and Thailand. Russia also lost a few potential deals. Indonesia canceled an order for 11 Russian fighter jets last year, buying American and French planes instead.\n\nFor many Southeast Asian nations, the United States is an increasingly attractive arms supplier because it links weapons purchases with military or diplomatic support against China, Mr. Wezeman said. Several European arms suppliers have been willing to help countries in the region develop their own arms industries and capabilities, in some cases through technology transfers, he added.\n\nAnother reason to avoid purchasing Russian arms is to signal a neutral position on the invasion of Ukraine, said John Parachini, a senior defense researcher at the RAND Corporation.\n\n\"Despite a likely aggressive Russian effort to market its arms exports in the Southeast Asia, they will find fewer customers,\" he said.\n\nOne exception might be Myanmar, where the ruling military junta, saddled with U.S. sanctions that limit its weapons purchases, has signaled a willingness to sign more arms deals with Russia. However, there are questions about whether the Kremlin would have the supplies to manufacture them.\n\nAnother could be Vietnam, Russias largest arms client in Southeast Asia. Because that countrys military arsenal has been built around Soviet and Russian weaponry for decades, adding weapons from new suppliers could create compatibility issues, said Ridzwan Rahmat, the principal defense analyst at Janes, based in Singapore.\n\nAt the same time, he added, Vietnam appears to be \"slowly shifting its orbit from Russian systems to a mix that includes NATO-compliant ones, although this will take decades.\"\n\nEven before the war, Vietnam was trying to diversify its arsenal by manufacturing its own guns and troop carriers and buying small amounts of weapons from India and Israel. The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnams military at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\n\"If we want to maintain some kind of deterrence capability toward China, the modernization has to speed up like 10 times faster,\" he said.",

Those systems have also been used to shell Mykolaiv, sometimes with devastating effect.\n\nKhlan posted a photograph purportedly showing the \"remains of the equipment.\"\n\nKhlan said there had also been further hits in the area of the Antonivskyi bridge, where Russian forces and the pro-Russian administration have been operating ferries and pontoon bridges to resupply the west bank, where thousands of Russian troops remain.\n\nHe said that in the city of Kakhovka on the east bank of the river Dnipro the three streets closest to the river were being forcibly evacuated.

But the resistance movement and the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to fight.\"\n\nKhlan repeated what other Ukrainian officials have asserted: that the Russian-backed authorities have left the city of Kherson which is on the west bank to set up office in the city of Skadovsk, much closer to Crimea.\n\n\"As for the urgent and mandatory \"evacuation\" called for by the Russians, our people are not going to go anywhere. If the locals did not have the opportunity to go to the de-occupied [Ukrainian-held] territory or decided to stay at home, they definitely do not want to go to Russia,\" Khlan said.",

All ASEAN leaders, aside from the head of Myanmars military junta, will attend.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antnio Guterres and United States President Joe Biden have confirmed participation alongside other ASEAN dialogue partners and those with observer status, and the government here has said it hoped each of the 25 invited leaders will make the trip.\n\nTo date, the notable absence is Russian President Vladimir Putin who, as the Cambodian government persistently notes, \"is yet to confirm\" his attendance. And thats unlikely given Hun Sens support for Ukraine and last Tuesdays online meeting with his counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe pair agreed that Hun Sen will visit Ukraine at \"an appropriate time,\" send a team of de-miners to the war-torn country, and exchange ambassadors.\n\nZelenskyy also asked to deliver a statement via video link during the summit and reaffirmed Ukraines wish to become a Sectoral Dialogue Partner, which would be one step away from full Dialogue Partner status, on par with the likes of the U.S., Australia, Japan, and Russia.\n\nHun Sen supported the request for a diplomatic upgrade and offered to mediate peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv on the sidelines of the summits. This is not unrealistic given that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will also attend the summit for the signing of the Instrument of Accession to the Treaty on Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.\n\nHun Sen also \"expressed concern over the recent attacks on [Kyiv] and other cities in Ukraine, which have claimed many deaths, injuries and severe damage to civilian infrastructure, power outages and water shortages, as well as serious energy and food crises,\" a statement said.\n\nWhile Russia is also an old Cold War ally of Cambodia, there has been scuttlebutt in diplomatic circles for almost two decades regarding Hun Sens annoyance with Putin over his unwillingness to write off Cambodias debts of $1.5 billion, incurred after the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. That debt put an unnecessary strain on relations between Moscow and Phnom Penh until it was eventually re-categorized as an \"investment,\" an ambiguous term that failed to impress.\n\nThis is not a seismic diplomatic shift, but it does matter.\n\nIn opposing Russias invasion of Ukraine, Cambodia was also a co-sponsor of last months U.N. resolution that condemned Moscows annexation of four Ukrainian regions.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is almost alone in its absolute support for the junta in Myanmar a policy which Hun Sen, at the start of his time as this years chair, seemed comfortable with as he began negotiations to normalize relations between Naypyidaw and ASEAN.\n\nThose talks ultimately failed, served up as an embarrassment after the junta did not release the Australian economist Sean Turnell, as reportedly promised, and then ignored Hun Sens pleas not to execute four pro-democracy activists in July, on the eve of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting.\n\nUkraine is one item on Cambodias foreign policy agenda that syncs neatly with the West and that should annoy Moscow. A much harsher stance on Myanmar is expected once Indonesia assumes the chair for 2023, when Cambodia is expected to acquiesce. That should also annoy Putin.\n\nMoscows reality is that its influence in Southeast Asia is now minimal and too often overrated by Putins delusions of Russia as a great superpower.\n\nAs such, his failure to attend the upcoming ASEAN summit as viewed through the Cambodian prism is just another example of Russias lost relevance, more so as the political dynamics across Southeast Asia are rapidly being reshaped.",

                "cc_text": "Washington CNN\n\nUkraines fears that its troops may lose access to Elon Musks crucial Starlink internet service deepened in the past week after 1,300 of the militarys satellite units went offline, according to two sources familiar with the outage.\n\nThe small, easy-to-use satellite dishes made by Musks private rocket company SpaceX have been universally hailed as a game-changing source of communication for Ukraines military, allowing it to fight and stay online even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia.\n\nBut concerns have risen recently over the dependability of SpaceX after discussions about funding were revealed and outages were reported near the frontlines.\n\nCNN first reported that SpaceX sent a letter in September to the Pentagon claiming it had spent almost $100 million funding Starlink in Ukraine and that it could no longer continue to do so. The letter requested that the Defense Department take over more of the funding for Ukraines military, which it calculated would run tens of millions of dollars a month.\n\nDays after the CNN report, Musk appeared to reverse course, claiming that SpaceX had withdrawn the request.\n\n\"The hell with it,\" Musk tweeted, \"well just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.\"\n\nNegotiations between SpaceX and the Defense Department continue despite Musks claim that SpaceX withdrepw its request, according to a senior defense official.\n\n\"Negotiations are very much underway. Everyone in our building knows were going to pay them,\" the senior Pentagon official told CNN, adding that the department is eager to have commitments in writing \"because we worry hell change his mind.\"\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk provides an update on the development of the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket at the companys Launch facility in south Texas. Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk attended a ceremony for US Space Force which also included Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Musk has also been embroiled in his high-profile and controversial takeover of Twitter.\n\nNeither Musk nor SpaceX responded to a request for comment. The Ukrainian government, including the Ministry of Defense, did not immediately respond.\n\nThe recent outage started on October 24 and was described by one person briefed on the situation as a \"huge problem\" for Ukraines military. The terminals had been disconnected, this person said, due to a lack of funding.\n\nThe outage affected a block of 1,300 terminals that Ukraine purchased from a British company in March and were used for combat-related operations.\n\nSpaceX was charging Ukraines military $2,500 a month to keep each of the 1,300 units connected, pushing the total cost to almost $20 million by September, the person briefed on the matter said. Eventually, they could no longer afford to pay, the person said.\n\nA British request\n\nBefore the terminals went completely dark, Ukraines Ministry of Defense made a request in early October to their British counterparts to pick up the $3.25 million monthly bill. The batch of terminals were also rotated out as concerns grew that service could be turned off, in order to minimize the impact, the source said.\n\nA British official said after discussions between the ministries \"it was agreed there were higher priority military capabilities.\" Among many other channels of support, the UK has been flying thousands of Ukrainian troops to Britain for training before they head back to the frontlines.\n\n\"We support a number of terminals that have a direct tactical utility for Ukraines military in repelling Russias invasion,\" the British official told CNN. \"We consider and prioritize all new requests in terms of the impact contributions would have in supporting Ukraine to defend its people against Putins deplorable invasion.\"\n\nA senior Ukrainian official confirmed the outage, calling the Starlink units \"very important\" for Ukraines fight against Russia.\n\nThe September letter from SpaceX to the Pentagon said there were almost 20,000 Starlink terminals in Ukraine. At that time, by SpaceXs own admission, the majority of them were fully or partially purchased with outside funding, including from the US, Polish and UK governments. The letter claimed those sources paid for about 30% of the monthly connectivity bill as well.\n\nThe terminals, which include small satellite dishes, connect to SpaceXs constellation of satellites orbiting the earth and not only keep troops and civilians online but have been used with lethal effect, proving critical for Ukraines use of drones and artillery targeting.\n\nIts unclear exactly how many terminals Ukraines military is operating but the 1,300 that recently shut off represent a significant portion. In July the countrys commander-in-chief wrote Musk directly asking for more, in a letter seen by CNN, saying approximately 4,000 had been deployed by the military.\n\nA woman rides a bicycle past a damaged building in the town of Kupiansk on November 3, 2022, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, Musk said that of the more than 25,000 terminals now in Ukraine, fewer than 11,000 were paying for the service, which can run as high as $4,500 per month.\n\nOn Monday a Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on potential contracts or agreements but said talks are ongoing.\n\n\"We continue to discuss Ukraines satellite communication needs with Ukraine and companies like SpaceX and others,\" Brigadier General Patrick Ryder told reporters.\n\nWhether greater cooperation with SpaceX would give the US government stronger control over the Starlink signal in Ukraine has not been answered. Currently SpaceX controls where Ukraine Starlink terminals can be used and outages have previously been reported by Ukrainian units near the front, as they advanced and liberated Russian-held areas.\n\nAs a result, Musks control of the signal gives him significant sway over the battlefield at a time when he has come under heavy criticism for arguing that Ukraine should sue for peace and give up some of its territory.",

Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraines southern military command, said it could be a Russian trap. \"This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles,\" she said in televised comments. \"We continue fighting, also in the Kherson direction, despite the fact that the enemy is trying to convince us that they are leaving the settlements and creating the effect of a total evacuation.\"\n\nUS secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said Thursday he believes that Ukrainian forces are able to retake Kherson, calling their work \"methodical\" and \"effective\".\n\nUkraine has described the forced relocation of its citizens in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as \"deportations\" and \"war crimes\". Russian authorities in Kherson have been relocating civilians, claiming it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer. One week after Russian authorities relocated 70,000 civilians from the right bank of the Dnipro River to the left bank, Russian authorities said they were moving 70,000 civilians from the left bank to be \"temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation,\" citing \"possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station\".\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said Thursday. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said.\n\nDue to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying units threatening to shoot their own retreating soldiers, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. An intelligence report released early this morning described these Russian units as \"barrier troops\" or \"blocking units\" used to compel offensives.\n\nOleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said that yesterday in Izium a 69-year-old man was blown up by a mine and hospitalised with moderate injuries. In a message on Telegram, he said that in the last day Ukrainian forces had neutralised \"471 explosive objects\" in the region.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to the UK has claimed UK special forces were involved in a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscows Black Sea fleet. Andrei Kelin told Sky News: \"We perfectly know about [the] participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done.\" Kelin added: \"This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.\"\n\nAnother 107 Ukrainian service personnel were freed from Russian captivity in a prisoner of war swap, Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed. \"Many of them were wounded, and very seriously,\" he said in his latest national address.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin ordered a one-time payment of 195,000 roubles (2,800) for contract soldiers and those who have been mobilised to fight in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Thursday. Last week Moscow said the \"partial mobilisation\" of 300,000 reservists was over but conceded there had been problems\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that he will not attend the G20 summit taking place in two weeks in Bali if Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation will be participating in the conference.",

                "cc_text": "For centuries, Russia has seen itself as one of the worlds great powers. This superpower status was somewhat sullied by the humiliations of the 1991 Soviet collapse, but post-Soviet Russia has worked hard under Vladimir Putin to reclaim its position among the leading nations on the global stage. During the first two decades of his reign, Putin won plaudits for rebuilding Russias military and economic might, and was credited with returning the country to the top table of international affairs. However, his disastrous invasion of Ukraine has now done much to reverse this progress by exposing the deep dysfunction and hollow boasts that lie behind the facade of Russias superpower pretensions.\n\nRussias weakness has not come as a total surprise. Ever since the fall of the USSR, Western commentators have noted the debilitating impact of corruption at every level of the modern Russian state. In recent decades, some have branded the Putin regime a \"mafia state,\" where the boundaries between the authorities and organized crime are blurred.\n\nCorruption has flourished under Putin amid a climate of stagnation inherited from the late Soviet era. Unlike Ukraine, post-Soviet Russia has never undergone de-communization or acknowledged the need to reject the Soviet legacy. Instead, Putin has rehabilitated the Soviet era and placed the Red Armys role in the defeat of Nazi Germany at the heart of his vision for a modern Russian national identity. Efforts to honor the memory of Stalins victims have been silenced and attempts to acknowledge the crimes of the USSR drowned out by a victory cult that has elevated the Soviet World War II experience to the level of religious cult and re-established Josef Stalin as a national hero. In 2020, Putin condemned Russians to a further sixteen years of stagnation when he staged a referendum on constitutional reforms that made it possible to extend his reign until 2036.\n\nFrom politics to the economy, the consequences of widespread corruption and stagnation can be seen throughout Russian society. Crucially, this negative impact is also highly visible in the invasion of Ukraine. Whereas Ukrainian troops have repeatedly demonstrated the kind of initiative and leadership that one would expect from a society shaped by two post-Soviet pro-democracy revolutions, the Russian military remains hamstrung by a deeply hierarchical system and rigid chain of command.\n\nOn the eve of this years invasion, the Russian military was widely touted as the worlds number two army, but such claims have been brutally debunked by subsequent events in Ukraine. Putins army has been exposed in almost every department, from poor leadership and outdated tactics to equally out-of-date equipment. Chronic corruption within the Russian Ministry of Defense has hampered military logistics, with soldiers in many instances receiving kit dating from the 1970s or earlier. It has also become painfully obvious that many of the vehicles and weapons listed as part of the vast Russian arsenal exist on paper only. With the war now in its ninth month, chronic supply problems mean that Russia is now increasingly reliant on Iran for drones that it is unable to produce itself.\n\nThese shortcomings have highlighted the cosmetic nature of the much-vaunted military reforms carried out by Russia over the past two decades. In reality, the Russian army under Putin remains largely a Soviet relic with a distinctively Soviet political culture that allows Russian commanders to treat soldiers with contempt. This lack of consideration for troops has been particularly evident in the treatment of recently mobilized Russians, many of whom have been sent to the front in Ukraine with minimal training and inadequate equipment.\n\nThe human price of Russias military failures in Ukraine has been exceptionally high. An estimated 70,000 Russian soldiers have been killed during the first eight months of the invasion, according to the latest Ukrainian Ministry of Defense data. While this figure is disputed, even the most conservative independent analysis indicates tens of thousands of Russian casualties. This makes the invasion of Ukraine far deadlier than the nine-year Soviet campaign in Afghanistan, which resulted in the loss of 15,000 Soviet troops and has been widely cited as a contributing factor in the collapse of the USSR.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has also revealed other areas where todays Russia falls well short of superpower status. Unlike China and other rising powers, Russia has never diversified or modernized its economy. Instead, the countrys ruling elites have prioritized the accumulation of staggering personal fortunes. As a result, todays Russia remains heavily dependent on commodities exports and has no technological equivalent of Chinas Huawei or South Koreas Samsung. With sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine restricting access to a range of cutting-edge tech, Russia has struggled to produce sophisticated weapons and has in some instances reportedly resorted to cannibalizing elements of household appliances.\n\nRussias excessive economic reliance on the export of energy and arms now looks to have been even more of a strategic blunder as international demand plummets due to the invasion of Ukraine. The EU has weaned itself off Russian gas earlier than expected and will enter 2023 with a high degree of independence from the Kremlins energy blackmail. With European customers turning away from Russian energy, Moscow will struggle to find sufficient alternative buyers for gas in the coming year as Russia has not invested in LNG.\n\nMeanwhile, Russias defense industry also faces bleak prospects. The often abysmal performance of the Russian military in Ukraine has been a PR disaster for Russian arms exporters, who must now explain why their products are so technologically inferior. Numerous traditional clients have already cancelled weapons contracts. More are expected to follow suit.\n\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, Russia has become something of an international pariah. The entire Western world has condemned Moscows actions while even traditional allies such as China and India have offered muted criticism. Only a handful of fellow pariahs such as Syria, North Korea, and Nicaragua have been prepared to stand with Russia and back Moscow at the United Nations. In the former Soviet region, only Belarus has voted with Russia at the UN.\n\nThis international isolation has highlighted the fundamental weakness of Russias geopolitical position and the absence of any meaningful message behind Moscows anti-Western posturing. Putins attempts to position Russia as a champion of traditional values have failed to resonate. In reality, abortion, divorce, suicide, and alcoholism rates are all significantly higher in Russia than in most European countries. Russians have a far shorter life expectancy and are poorer on average than their European neighbors. This poverty is reflected in the mass plundering of household goods from Ukrainian homes, with Russian soldiers stealing everything from washing machines to used underwear.\n\nThe war has also revealed the limitations of Russian soft power, with Western audiences in particular overwhelmingly rejecting Russian attempts to justify the invasion. Even in regions with strong historic links to Russia such as the the South Caucasus and Central Asia, audiences have treated Kremlin narratives with deep distrust.\n\nDespite massive investment in media operations, the invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of Kremlin disinformation. In the West, Moscow has largely been preaching to the converted and has failed to move beyond a minority audience driven primarily by anti-Americanism and conspiratorial thinking. The picture is similar in the political sphere. As the recent election of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has shown, Russian support for right-wing populists and nationalists has not led to any major breakthroughs in European politics.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has ruthlessly revealed Putins Russia as a Potemkin Great Power. Like the Potemkin villages erected along the banks of Ukraines Dnipro River in the late eighteenth century to impress visiting Russian Empress Katherine the Great, Russias much-hyped revival under Putin is in fact a masterly facade designed to disguise a far less impressive reality. This illusion has now been shattered by the harsh realities of Europes largest armed conflict since World War II.\n\nRussia is heading toward an historic defeat in Ukraine that will have profound ramifications for the way Russians view their state and themselves. Defeat in Ukraine will undermine the imperial identity that defines Putins Russia. It will force the Russian public to belatedly confront decades of nationalistic myth-making by their own rapacious elites. It is still far too early to predict what kind of Russia will emerge from the wreckage of Putins Ukraine invasion, but it already looks unlikely that anyone will continue to view the country as one of the worlds superpowers.\n\nTaras Kuzio is a professor of political science at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy and author of the forthcoming book \"Fascism and Genocide.

Russian troops destroying civilian boats in Kherson, Ukrainian authorities claim\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkraine's army accused Russia on Sunday of the large-scale destruction of civilian vessels moored on the banks of the Dnipro River in the occupied southern region of Kherson.\n\nUkrainian forces have been piling pressure on Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnipro that bisects Ukraine, fuelling speculation that Moscow's troops are preparing to retreat to the other side.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff's spokesperson said in a statement that the fuel from the destroyed vessels had leaked into the river's delta and also accused Moscow's forces of appropriating the vessels' engines and other equipment.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff gave no explanation for Moscow's actions. Destroying civilian vessels would prevent Ukrainian forces from using them should they decide to cross to the eastern side in the event of any Russian withdrawal.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Russian Defence Ministry.\n\n2. Ukraine plunged into darkness amid Russian shelling\n\nPower cuts across Ukraine continued over the weekend following intense Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's state electricity operator, Ukrenergo, said on Saturday blackouts would happen in Kyiv and seven other neighbouring regions, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv.\n\nThe move comes after Russian forces unleashed a series of crippling attacks on Ukraine, damaging power plants, water supplies and other civilian targets.\n\nLater on Saturday, Ukrenergo said the planned outages for limited periods of time would not be enough and that emergency blackouts, which could last an indefinite amount of time, are needed.\n\nA woman walks her dog during a blackout in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, Nov. 4, 2022 Andrew Kravchenko/Copyright 2022 The AP. All rights reserved.\n\nUkraine has been grappling with power outages and disruption of water supplies since Russia started massive missile and drone strikes on the country's energy infrastructure last month.\n\nMoscow has said they were in response to what it alleged were Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, the region that Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nUkraine denies these allegations.\n\n3. Judge in Russian-occupied Donetsk gunned down\n\nA judge in Donetsk, annexed by Russia at the end of September, was shot on Saturday, leaving him in a serious condition, according to local authorities.\n\nThe judge, Alexander Nikulin, was from the Supreme Court of the Republic of Donetsk (DNR) in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nHe presided over the panel of judges who sentenced foreign fighters who fought on the side of Ukraine, including two Britons and a Morrocan man.\n\n\"On the evening of 4 November 2022, the Interior Ministry received a message about an assassination attempt in the city of Vougleguirsk,\" announced the self-styled republic's interior ministry.\n\n\"The victim was wounded by bullets\", they said, adding he was \"in serious condition\" and \"fighting for his life\".\n\nThe ministry stopped short of giving more details on the modus operandi of the gun attack or why it had taken place.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNikulin's condition was \"serious\", said another senior official in the Russian-backed authority, Denis Pushilin.\n\n4. Georgia booms as Russians flee Putin's war\n\nThe influx of Russians fleeing their country's partial mobilisation has triggered an economic boom in Georgia, report Reuters.\n\nThe small nation wedged beneath Russia in the Caucuses is set to become one of the world's fastest-growing economies this year due to the arrival of more than 100,000 Russians since the start of the war in February.\n\nBut locals have complained that the influx is pricing them out of the property market and driving up prices of essential goods in a country already blighted by high levels of poverty.\n\nProtests at the Georgia-Russia border broke out in September, with demonstrators claiming Russians posed a threat to national security and the economy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA anti-Russian protest organised by political party Droa near the border crossing at Verkhny Lars between Georgia and Russia in Georgia, Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2022. Shakh Aivazov/Copyright 2022 The AP. All rights reserved\n\nGeorgia, home to 3.7 million people, is expected to record 10% economic growth in 2022 due to a consumption-led boom, according to international institutions.\n\nThis growth rate is in sharp contrast to the recessions predicted in other parts of the world.\n\n\"On the economic side, Georgia is doing very well,\" Vakhtang Butskhrikidze, CEO of the country's largest bank TBC, told Reuters in an interview at its Tbilisi headquarters.\n\n\"There's some kind of boom,\" he added. \"All industries are doing very well from micros up to corporates. I can't think of any industry which this year has problems.\"\n\nAt least 112,000 Russians have emigrated to Georgia this year, border-crossing statistics show, with a large wave arriving after Putin announced the nationwide mobilisation in September.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n5. Iran admits sending drones to Russia for first time\n\nIran's foreign minister acknowledged for the first time on Saturday that his country has supplied Russia with drones, maintaining the transfer came before Moscow's war on Ukraine.\n\nKyiv claims Russia is using Iranian-made drones to attack its energy and civilian infrastructure, causing large-scale blackouts across the country.\n\nIranian authorities have previously denied arming Russia.\n\n\"We gave a limited number of drones to Russia months before the Ukraine war,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters on Saturday after a meeting in Tehran.\n\nIranian officials previously denied providing Moscow's armed forces with weapons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this week, Iran's UN Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani called such allegations \"totally unfounded\" and maintained Iran was a neutral party to the conflict.\n\nWestern governments have called for a UN investigation into the use of Iranian-made drones in the Ukraine war, alleging they are being deployed to devastating effect.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard has in the past boasted about supplying weapons to some of the world's top powers.\n\nAcknowledging arms shipments, Amirabdollahian claimed on Saturday that Iran did not know its drones were being used in Ukraine. He said Iran remained committed to peace.\n\n\"If (Ukraine) has any documents in their possession that Russia used Iranian drones in Ukraine, they should provide them to us,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"If it is proven to us that Russia used Iranian drones in the war against Ukraine, we will not be indifferent to this issue.\"\n\n6. Only diplomacy can solve Ukraine war, claim former world leaders\n\nAn end to the bloody war in Ukraine can only be brought about through diplomacy, a group of former world leaders said on Friday.\n\nThe group, known as The Elders, said total victory on the battlefield was impossible for either warring party and that they should pursue dialogue to end the months-long conflict.\n\nFounded by Nelson Mandela, the prominent ex-world leaders delivered the message to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a visit to Kyiv this summer, according to Mary Robinson, former Irish president, who chairs the group.\n\n\"We need to encourage more thinking about how it will end in order to get the idea that this needs to end, as opposed to increasing the military arsenal on both sides and the devastation to the population in Ukraine,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Elders have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and a reckless, unjustifiable act of aggression that threatens to destabilize world peace and security.\"\n\nZeid Raad Al Hussein, left, Mary Robinson, second from right, and Ernesto Zedillo, right, listen as former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Friday 2022.

                "cc_text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nLIVERPOOL, England On the long picket line outside the gates of Liverpools Peel Port, rain-soaked dock workers warm themselves with cups of tea as they listen to 1980s pop.\n\nDozens of buses, cars and trucks honk in solidarity as they pass.\n\nDockers strikes are not new to Liverpool, nor is deprivation. But this latest walk-out at Britains fourth-largest port is part of something much bigger, a great wave of public and private sector strikes taking place across the U.K. Railways, postal services, law courts and garbage collections are among the many public services grinding to a halt.\n\nThe immediate cause of the discontent, as elsewhere, is the rising cost of living. Inflation in the United Kingdom breached the 10 percent mark this year, with wages failing to keep pace.\n\nBut the U.K.s economic woes long predate the current crisis. For more than a decade, Britain has been beset by weak economic growth, anaemic productivity, and stagnant private and public sector investment. Since 2016, its political leadership has been in a state of Brexit-induced flux.\n\nHalf a century after U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger looked at the U.K.s 1970s economic malaise and declared that \"Britain is a tragedy,\" the United Kingdom is heading to be the sick man of Europe once again.\n\nThe immediate cause of Liverpool dockers discontent that brought them to strike is the rising cost of living. | Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nHere in Liverpool, the \"scars run very deep,\" said Paul Turking, a dock worker in his late 30s. British voters, he added, have \"been misled\" by politicians promises to \"level up\" the country by investing heavily in regional economies. Conservatives \"will promise you the world and then pull the carpet out from under your feet,\" he complained.\n\n\"Theres no middle class no more,\" said John Delij, a Peel Port veteran of 15 years. He sees the cost-of-living crisis and economic stagnation whittling away the middle rung of the economic ladder.\n\n\"How many billionaires do we have?\" Delij asked, wondering how Britain could be the sixth-largest economy in the world with a record number of billionaires when food bank use is 35 percent above its pre-pandemic level. \"The workers put money back into the economy,\" he said.\n\nWhat would they do if they were in charge? \"Invest in affordable housing,\" said Turking. \"Housing and jobs.\"\n\nFalling behind\n\nThe British economy has been struck by particular turbulence over recent weeks. The cost of government borrowing soared in the wake of former PM Liz Truss disastrous mini-budget on September 23, with the U.K.s central bank forced to step in and steady the bond markets.\n\nBut while the swift installation of Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, as prime minister seems to have restored a modicum of calm, the economic backdrop remains bleak. Spending and welfare cuts are coming. Taxes are certain to rise. And the underlying problems cut deep.\n\nU.K. productivity growth since the financial crisis has trailed that of comparator nations such as the U.S., France and Germany. As such, peoples median incomes also lag behind neighboring countries over the same period. Only Russia is forecast to have worse economic growth among the G20 nations in 2023.\n\nIn 1976, the U.K. facing stagflation, a global energy crisis, a current account deficit and labor unrest had to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. It feels far-fetched, but today some are warning it could happen again.\n\nThe U.K. is spluttering its way through an illness brought about in part through a series of self-inflicted wounds that have undermined the basic pillars of any economy: confidence and stability.\n\nThe political and economic malaise is such that it has prompted unwanted comparisons with countries whose misfortunes Britain once watched amusedly from afar.\n\n\"The existential risk to the U.K. is not that were suddenly going to go off an economic cliff, or that the countrys going to descend into civil war or whatever,\" said Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at Kings College London. \"Its that we will become like Italy.\"\n\nPortes, of course, does not mean a country blessed with good weather and fine food but an economy hobbled by persistently low growth, caught in a dysfunctional political loop that lurches between \"corrupt and incompetent right-wing populists\" and \"well-intentioned technocrats who cant actually seem to turn the ship around.\"\n\n\"Thats not the future that we want in the U.K,\" he said.\n\nReviving the U.K.s flatlining economy will not happen overnight. As Italys experience demonstrates, its one thing to diagnose an illness another to cure it.\n\nExperts speak of an unbalanced model heavily reliant upon Britains services sector and beset with low productivity, a result of years of underinvestment and a flexible labor market which delivers low unemployment but often insecure and low-paid work.\n\n\"Were not investing in skills; businesses arent investing,\" said Xiaowei Xu, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"Its not that surprising that were not getting productivity growth.\"\n\nBut any attempt to address the countrys ailments will require its economic stewards to understand their underlying causes and those stretch back at least to the first truly global crisis of the 21st century.\n\nCrash and burn\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis hammered economies around the world, and the U.K. was no exception. Its economy shrunk by more than 6 percent between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009. Five years passed before it returned to its pre-recession size.\n\nFor Britain, the crisis in fact began in September 2007, a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when wobbles in the U.S. subprime mortgage market sparked a run on the British bank Northern Rock.\n\nThe U.K. discovered it was particularly vulnerable to such a shock. Over the second half of the 20th century, its manufacturing base had largely eroded as its services sector expanded, with financial and professional services and real estate among the key drivers. As the Bank of England put it: \"The interconnectedness of global finance meant that the U.K. financial system had become dangerously exposed to the fall-out from the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market.\"\n\nThe crisis was a \"big shock to the U.K.s broad economic model,\" said John Springford, from the Centre for European Reform. Productivity took an immediate hit as exports of financial services plunged. It never fully recovered.\n\n\"Productivity before the crash was basically, Can we create lots and lots of debt and generate lots and lots of income on the back of this? Can we invent collateralized debt obligations and trade them in vast volumes?\" said James Meadway, director of the Progressive Economy Forum and a former adviser to Labours left-wing former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.\n\nA post-crash clampdown on City practises had an obvious impact. \"This is a major part of the British economy, so if its suddenly not performing the way it used to for good reasons things overall are going to look a bit shaky,\" Meadway added. The shock did not contain itself to the economy. In a pattern that would be repeated, and accentuated, in the coming years, it sent shuddering waves through the countrys political system, too. The 2010 election was fought on how to best repair Britains broken economy. In 2009, the U.K. had the second-highest budget deficit in the G7, trailing only the U.S., according to the U.K. governments own fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The Conservative manifesto declared \"our economy is overwhelmed by debt,\" and promised to close the U.K.s mounting budget deficit in five years with sharp public sector cuts. The incumbent Labour government responded by pledging to halve the deficit by 2014 with \"deeper and tougher\" cuts in public spending than the significant reductions overseen by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The election returned a hung parliament, with the Conservatives entering into a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The age of austerity was ushered in.\n\nAusterity nation\n\nDefenders of then-Chancellor George Osbornes austerity program insist it saved Britain from the sort of market-led calamity witnessed this fall, and put the U.K. economy in a condition to weather subsequent global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout from the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"That hard work made policies like furlough and the energy price cap possible,\" said Rupert Harrison, one of Osbornes closest Treasury advisers.\n\nPointing to the brutal market response to Truss freewheeling economic plans, Harrison praised the \"wisdom\" of the coalition in prioritizing tackling the U.K.s debt-GDP ratio. \"You never know when you will be vulnerable to a loss of credibility,\" he noted.\n\nBut Osbornes detractors argue austerity which saw deep cuts to community services such as libraries and adult social care; courts and prisons services; road maintenance; the police and so much more also stripped away much of the U.K.s social fabric, causing lasting and profound economic damage. A recent study claimed austerity was responsible for hundreds of thousands of excess deaths.\n\nUnder Osbornes plan, three-quarters of the fiscal consolidation was to be delivered by spending cuts. With the exception of the National Health Service, schools and aid spending, all government budgets were slashed; public sector pay was frozen; taxes (mainly VAT) rose.\n\nBut while the government came close to delivering its fiscal tightening target for 2014-15, \"the persistent underperformance of productivity and real GDP over that period meant the deficit remained higher than initially expected,\" the OBR said. By his own measure, Osborne had failed, and was forced to push back his deficit-elimination target further. Austerity would have to continue into the second half of the 2010s.\n\nMany economists contend that the fiscal belt-tightening sucked demand out of the economy and worsened Britains productivity crisis by stifling investment. \"That certainly did hit U.K. growth and did some permanent damage,\" said Kings College Londons Portes.\n\n\"If that investment isnt there, other people start to find it less attractive to open businesses,\" former Labour aide Meadway added. \"If your railways arent actually very good it does add up to a problem for businesses.\"\n\nA 2015 study found U.K. productivity, as measured by GDP per hour worked, was now lower than in the rest of the G7 by a whopping 18 percentage points.\n\n\"Frankly, nobody knows the whole answer,\" Osborne said of Britains productivity conundrum in May 2015. \"But what I do know is that Id much rather have the productivity challenge than the challenge of mass unemployment.\"\n\nJobs miracle\n\nRising employment was indeed a signature achievement of the coalition years. Unemployment dropped below 6 percent across the U.K. by the end of the parliament in 2015, with just Germany and Austria achieving a lower rate of joblessness among the then-28 EU states. Real-term wages, however, took nearly a decade to recover to pre-crisis levels.\n\nEconomists like Meadway contend that the rise in employment came with a price, courtesy of Britains famously flexible labor market. He points to a Sports Direct warehouse in the East Midlands, where a 2015 Guardian investigation revealed the predominantly immigrant workforce was paid illegally low wages, while the working conditions were such that the facility was nicknamed \"the gulag.\"\n\nThe warehouse, it emerged, was built on a former coal mine, and for Meadway the symbolism neatly charts the U.K.s move away from traditional heavy industry toward more precarious service sector employment. \"Its not a secure job anymore,\" he said. \"Once you have a very flexible labor market, the pressure on employers to pay more and the capacity for workers to bargain for more is very much reduced.\"\n\nThroughout the period, the Bank of England the U.K.s central bank kept interest rates low and pursued a policy of quantitative easing. \"That tends to distort what happens in the economy,\" argued Meadway. QE, he said, is a \"good [way of] getting money into the hands of people who already have quite a lot\" and \"doesnt do much for people who depend on wage income.\"\n\nMeanwhile whether necessary or not the U.K.s austerity policies undoubtedly worsened a decades-long trend of underinvestment in skills and research and development (Britain lags only Italy in the G7 on R&D spending). At British schools, there was a 9 percent real terms fall in per-pupil spending between 2009 and 2019, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies Xu. \"As countries get richer, usually you start spending more on education,\" Xu noted.\n\nTwo senior ministers in the coalition government David Gauke, who served in the Treasury throughout Osbornes tenure, and ex-Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable have both accepted that the government might have focused more on higher taxation and less on cuts to public spending. But both also insisted the U.K had ultimately been correct to prioritize putting its public finances on a sounder footing.\n\nIt was February 2018 before Britain finally achieved Osbornes goal of eliminating the deficit on its day-to-day budget.\n\nAusterity was coming to an end, at last. But Osborne had already left the Treasury, 18 months earlier swept away along with Cameron in the wake of a seismic national uprising.\n\n***\n\nDavid Cameron had won the 2015 election outright, despite or perhaps because of the stringent spending cuts his coalition government had overseen, more of which had been pledged in his 2015 manifesto. Also promised, of course, was a public vote on Britains EU membership.\n\nThe reasons for the leave vote that followed were many and complex but few doubt that years of underinvestment in poorer parts of the U.K. were among them.\n\nRegardless, the 2016 EU referendum triggered a period of political acrimony and turbulence not seen in Westminster for generations. With no pre-agreed model of what Brexit should actually entail, the U.K.s future relationship with the EU became the subject of heated and protracted debate. After years of wrangling, Britain finally left the bloc at the end of January 2020, severing ties in a more profound way than many had envisaged.\n\nWhile the twin crises of COVID and Ukraine have muddled the picture, most economists agree Brexit has already had a significant impact on the U.K. economy. The size of Britains trade flows relative to GDP has fallen further than other G7 countries, business investment growth trails the likes of Japan, South Korea and Italy, and the OBR has stuck by its March 2020 prediction that Brexit would reduce productivity and U.K. GDP by 4 percent.\n\nPerhaps more significantly, Brexit has ushered in a period of political instability. As prime ministers come and go (the U.K. is now on its fifth since 2016), economic programs get neglected, or overturned. Overseas investors look on with trepidation.\n\n\"The evidence that the referendum outcome, and the kind of uncertainty and change in policy that it created, have led to low investment and low growth in the U.K. is fairly compelling,\" said professor Stephen Millard, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\nBeyond the instability, the broader impact of the vote to leave remains contentious.\n\nPortes argued as many Remain supporters also do that much harm was done by the decision to leave the EUs single market. \"Its the facts, not the uncertainty that in my view is responsible for most of the damage,\" he said.\n\nBrexit supporters dismiss such claims.\n\n\"Its difficult statistically to find much significant effect of Brexit on anything,\" said professor Patrick Minford, founder member of Economists for Brexit. \"Theres so much else going on, so much volatility.\"\n\nMinford, an economist favored by ex-PM Truss, acknowledged that \"Brexit is disruptive in the short run, so its perfectly possible that you would get some short-run disruption.\" But he added: \"It was a long-term policy decision.\"\n\nWhere next?\n\nPlenty of economists can rattle off possible solutions, although actually delivering them has thus far evaded Britains political class. \"Its increasing investment, having more of a focus on the long-term, its having economic strategies that you set out and actually commit to over time,\" says the IFS Xu. \"As far as possible, its creating more certainty over economic policy.\"\n\nBut in seeking to bring stability after the brief but chaotic Truss era, new U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has signaled a fresh period of austerity is on the way to plug the latest hole in the nations finances. Leveling Up Secretary Michael Gove told Times Radio that while, ideally, you wouldnt want to reduce long-term capital investments, he was sure some spending on big projects \"will be cut.\"\n\nThis could be bad news for many of the U.K.s long-awaited infrastructure schemes such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, which has been in the works for almost 15 years and already faces a familiar mix of local resistance, vested interests, and a sclerotic planning system.\n\n\"We have a real problem in the sense that the only way to really durably raise productivity growth for this country is for investments to pick up,\" said Springford, from the Centre for European Reform. \"And the headwinds to that are quite significant.\"\n\nFor dock workers at Liverpools Peel Port, the prospect of a fresh round of austerity amid a cost-of-living crisis is too much to bear. \"Workers all over this country need to stand up for themselves and join a union,\" insisted Delij.\n\nFor him, its all about priorities and the arguments still echo back to the great crash of 15 years ago. \"They bailed the bankers out in 2007,\" he said, \"and cant bail hungry people out now.\"",

                "cc_text": "Chemical giant BASF announced at the end of October that it would be \"permanently\" downsizing its operations in Europe to escape high energy costs | Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nFRANKFURT Is this the beginning of the end for German industry?\n\nEurope's manufacturing powerhouse is set to scrape by this winter thanks to gas reserves built up over the last eight months, avoiding an energy blackout.\n\nBut a darker scenario lurks just over the horizon, as high energy prices and lower gas reserves could conspire to trigger a wave of shutdowns among mid-sized companies unable to weather the storm as larger firms with deeper pockets seek safer economic ground in other countries.\n\nWithout relief in the form of cheaper power, the nightmare in 2023 and beyond could be a hollowing out of Germany's heavy industry which not only underpins its export-led economy but is also inextricably linked to thousands of suppliers in neighboring EU countries like the Czech Republic and Slovakia. For them, and for the rest of the EU's economy, the consequences of deindustrialization in Europe's biggest economy could be catastrophic.\n\n\"When we look back at the current energy crisis in 10 years or so, we might consider this time as the starting point for an accelerated deindustrialization in Germany,\" said Deutsche Bank economist Stefan Schneider.\n\nIn a sign of what may be coming, chemical giant BASF a pillar of German industry founded 157 years ago announced at the end of October that it would be \"permanently\" downsizing its operations in Europe to escape high energy costs. Others are expected to follow.\n\nWhile BASF is a huge energy consumer whose main site in Europe uses as much gas as Switzerland, pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers are also voracious users that may be tempted to seek cheaper energy elsewhere. Indeed some 9 percent of companies in the Mittelstand Germany's famed small- and medium-sized industrial sector are seriously considering moving their production abroad, according to a survey commissioned by the Foundation for Family Businesses in Germany and Europe, up from 6 percent six months ago.\n\n\"There is a baseline expectation that many of the high-energy manufacturing activities, especially in chemicals and pharmaceuticals, will leave to other locations,\" said Institute of International Finance Chief Economist Robin Brooks.\n\nThose who lack the financial firepower to uproot and relocate may have no choice but to shut down including business owners like Per Kadach, a fifth-generation butchershop owner who employs 100 people in Spremburg, eastern Germany, and whose business dates back to before the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nUnder new gas contracts effective next year, Kadach said he would have to pay eight times his current bill, while the price of raw materials he needs to run his business has rocketed upwards.\n\n\"The price for the glass we use for [packaging] our liver sausage has doubled over the past year,\" he said. \"I cannot tell you how much longer we can survive unless things change.\"\n\nScant comfort\n\nFor now, Europe's largest economy is holding up. Gross domestic product grew by 0.3 percent in the third quarter, and Goldman Sachs, which has been more bearish about Germany than other financial institutions, predicts a 1.1-percent contraction in 2023 painful, but not catastrophic.\n\n\"We expect a significant recession, but moderate compared to what we have seen during the financial crisis and the pandemic crisis,\" said Jari Stehn, an economist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nOptimists point to the fact that Germany has been able to build up significant gas reserves, and that spot prices have eased from their highs, as reasons to be hopeful. Plus, Germany's government has put 200 billion on the table to cushion the hit from high energy prices. \"Risks of energy rationing have diminished somewhat relative to what we saw a few weeks ago,\" added Stehn.\n\nYet the reprieve is a fragile one.\n\nGermany's economy is far more dependent on Russian gas than most of its neighbors and has no easy alternative to reach for, given that the Greens in government are hell-bent on opposing any extension of nuclear power beyond a current deadline of 2023.\n\nIn the meantime, there's little hope that gas prices will drop back to their pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. While medium-term projections are blurry at best, most investors expect the price for natural gas to drop below 100 per MWh only by 2025, which remains five times higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe longer prices remain high, the harder things get for German manufacturers and other energy-intensive industries.\n\nThat's why the International Monetary Fund and other institutions are warning that the real danger for Germany isn't this winter it's the next one. \"The winter will be difficult but the winter of 2023 could be even worse,\" IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said in a recent interview.\n\nStehn concurred: \"Once you come out of this winter, we think that storage tanks are going to be pretty low and Germany will find it much more difficult next year than this year to refill the storage tanks without significant Russian gas flows, particularly if China rebounds and China starts to buy more liquid gas off the global market.\"\n\nIt is not just rising energy costs \"de-globalization and disentangling from China are likely to remain a headwind for years to come,\" said Natixis economist Dirk Schumacher. \"The German economy may be potentially heading for years of underperformance vis--vis many of its European peers as it has to reinvent itself.\"\n\nIn that vein, Stehn points to patents as well as research and development in the green sectors as future economic drivers for Germany. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is a shining example of how this edge can turn into real economic value, contributing an estimated 0.5 to German GDP in 2021.\n\nAlso, Germanys low public debt level will help the government provide more aid, if need be.\n\n\"This is exactly the kind of medium-term shock in which Germany can now use the fiscal space that it has to smooth the transition, to help people retain jobs, and subsidized industries as it restructures,\" added Brooks of the Institute of International Finance.\n\nBut Kadach, for one, isn't hopeful.\n\n\"Even the carpenter said he is running out of business because nobody can afford them anymore. Roofers are running out of work because there are no roof tiles. With these energy prices, its simply too expensive to bake the tiles,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless things change, companies will go out of business.\"",

Mohammed Salem/Reuters\n\nSHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt Dozens of presidents and prime ministers spoke on Monday at a global summit on climate change after the United Nations chief opened the days session with a warning that the world was \"on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.\"\n\nThe U.N. secretary general, Antnio Guterres, set the tone for the annual United Nations-led international climate talks, which officially began on Sunday as the accumulating threats of war, warming and economic crisis take a toll on every continent, hitting the worlds most vulnerable people the hardest.\n\n\"We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing,\" Mr. Guterres said in opening remarks at the summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Dozens of world leaders delivered brief addresses at the event on Monday.\n\nLater, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told delegates the Russian invasion of Ukraine should prompt countries to invest more heavily in renewable energy. \"Putins abhorrent war in Ukraine, and rising energy prices across the world, are not a reason to go slow on climate change,\" Mr. Sunak said. \"They are a reason to act faster.\"\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France said the war in Ukraine should not change countries commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe talks opened under the shadow of unsettling new data: The World Meteorological Organization said on Sunday that the planet had likely witnessed its warmest eight years on record, including every year since countries came together in 2015 to create the landmark Paris agreement that was aimed at pivoting the global economy away from fossil fuels and slowing down warming.\n\nThe biggest fault line of this years talks is the question of what rich, industrialized countries that account for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions owe to those bearing the brunt of climate hazards. On that there was a small breakthrough on Sunday progress on the contentious issue of who will pay for the irreversible damage that climate change is wreaking on the worlds most vulnerable.\n\nEgypt is hosting the conference, and the government has tried to cast itself as a climate champion of the developing world. But those efforts have sometimes seemed at odds with the countrys troubling records on the environment and human rights. The most prominent political dissident in Egypt, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who has spent more than 200 days on a hunger strike in an effort to pressure the authorities to let him go, vowed to begin a water strike as the summit began.\n\nIn addition, protests, which have been a feature of earlier COP summits, have been noticeably absent so far in Egypt, partly as a result of strict security measures and the remoteness of the conference site from major cities.\n\nEven with protesters mostly absent from the streets, activists still seized on the opportunity to push governments to take tougher action against climate change. On Monday, environmental groups called for a \"fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty\" that would ultimately put an end to to all new oil, gas and coal projects.\n\nThe climate talks are the 27th session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations convention, which is why the event is known as COP27. Over 44,000 people have registered to attend, including representatives of government, business and civil society groups.\n\nThe talks come at the end of a year that saw extraordinary heat waves across the northern hemisphere, catastrophic flooding in Pakistan and Nigeria, and a punishing drought in China.\n\nAccording to a list posted by the United Nations, 110 heads of state and government are addressing the conference, a larger number than at many previous climate conferences. Of those, just seven are women.\n\nIn her remarks on Monday, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados linked the inability of vulnerable countries to cope with climate hazards to history, saying that countries of the Global North still controlled the money that countries of the Global South need in order to pivot away from fossil fuels.\n\nShe also restated a call for an overhaul of international development institutions like the World Bank.\n\n\"This world looks too much like it did when it was part of an imperialistic empire,\" she said.",

This occupation strategy not only affects the daily lives of civilians by denying them access to essential infrastructure but also complicates military engagement by using civilian structures for military purposes (2,5).

This occupation strategy has not only militarized civilian areas but also restricted local residents' movements, notably near the Melitopol airfield, as civilians are prohibited from approaching this area (2,5). The presence of military equipment in residential zones has likely increased the risk to civilians and complicated the dynamics of the conflict, impacting the local population's safety and the use of infrastructure (5).\n\nAdditionally, the conversion of civilian structures into military installations by Russian forces has implications for the broader conflict. It can be inferred that this tactic may be part of a deliberate strategy to deter Ukrainian attacks on these positions due to the potential for civilian casualties, complicating Ukrainian military operations. Russian forces have been reported to engage in looting and theft from residents and infrastructure sites, exacerbating the challenges faced by the local population. The occupation has also led to the obstruction of critical management and provision of basic amenities, which are vital for the community, especially during wartime (4,6). The use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes by Russian forces has, therefore, significantly affected the conflict dynamics in Melitopol and the surrounding region."

Columns of Russian forces have been arriving in Melitopol from the neighboring Kherson region to the west, and from other parts of Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region to the north, he said. \"The Russian military is settling in local houses they seized, schools and kindergartens.

A Ukrainian liberation of the area would pose fresh military headaches for Russias military commanders, bringing some parts of the Russian-occupied Crimea within range of Ukrainian Himars rocket systems, as well as threatening Russian operations around Melitopol and Mariupol.\n\nThe order to retreat came as Ukrainian forces pressed their attack on Russian positions on the western side of the river, including around the key town of Snihurivka, and as a key Russian-installed official in Kherson was reported to have died in murky circumstances.\n\nIn televised comments, Gen Sergei Surovikin, overall commander of the war, said he had recommended the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, citing logistical difficulties.\n\n\"Kherson cannot be fully supplied and function. Russia did everything possible to ensure the evacuation of the inhabitants of Kherson,\" Surovikin told Shoigu.\n\n\"We will save the lives of our soldiers and fighting capacity of our units. Keeping them on the right [western] bank is futile. Some of them can be used on other fronts,\" Surovikin said.\n\nWhile the move had been anticipated to prevent Russian forces being encircled by Ukraine on the western side of the river, the bald admission by Surovikin that Russian forces could not operate effectively comes despite recent efforts by the Kremlin to reinforce the Kherson front at the cost of the giving up large parts of Ukraines east.\n\nIt also marks a personal defeat for Surovikin, a notorious hardline air force officer, who was appointed the first overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine in October to turn around Russias failing war against Ukraine.\n\nDefending Surovikins decision to withdraw, the head of the Wagner private military corporation and Ukraine war hawk, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said: \"Of course, this is not a victorious step in this war, but it is important not to agonise, not succumb to paranoia, but to draw conclusions and work on our mistakes.\n\n\"Surovikin had to withdraw troops and save a thousand soldiers who are actually surrounded on enemy territory, which is completely cut off from supply routes. Who gave instructions to take this position and why is another question.\n\n\"The decision taken by Surovikin is not easy, but he acted like a man who is not afraid of responsibility. He did it in an organised manner, without fear, taking upon himself the full responsibility of decision-making.\"\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman at the frontline in Kherson region, Ukraine, on Monday. Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA\n\nThe announcement came a few hours after it was disclosed that Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy head of the Kherson region, had died in unclear circumstances with Russian media sources blaming a \"car crash\".\n\nStremousov a former anti-vaccination blogger had become the hated face of Russias occupation of Kherson, posting videos online, including a bizarre poetry rendition and hosting press conferences for pro-Russian media.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the crash happened near Henichesk, on the Sea of Azov, the seaside town used as the headquarters of the Russian occupation administration since it fled Kherson.\n\nThe Tass news agency said the press service for the head of the region had confirmed Stremousovs death.\n\nIn a video statement only hours before his death, Stremousov denounced what he called Ukrainian \"Nazis\" and said the Russian military was in \"full control\" of the situation in the south.\n\nAlexander Dugin, a far-right nationalist figure in Russia whose daughter was killed earlier this year in a car bomb, said: \"Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the administration of the Kherson region, has died. A true hero. Kherson must be defended at all costs. Kherson is what keeps Russia in power today.\"\n\nKirill Stremousov, who has died in a car crash. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia been transporting civilians away from Kherson, amid reports this week that some private ferries used by civilians for evacuation have also been sunk.\n\nIn the hours before the announcement of the Russian withdrawal, pro-Russian journalists and analysts had painted an increasingly gloomy picture.\n\nAhead of the announced retreat, Aleksandr Kots, a journalist with the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid who is in Kherson, said there was \"no good news\" there, suggesting that the announcement of withdrawal could come soon.\n\n\"We are waiting for an official announcement,\" he wrote on his Telegram channel. Kots also posted several videos from Kherson that he said showed Russian flags removed from government buildings.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the occupation administration has been relocated well to the south of the city.\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser and political commentator, said that the decision to leave Kherson would have \"catastrophic consequences\".\n\n\"In Russia, many fear that the decision to leave Kherson has already been made. It is the wrong decision. It could have catastrophic consequences for Russia.\"\n\nUkrainian officials warned in recent days that claims that Russian forces were preparing to withdraw may be a ruse, suggesting that some Russian troops were disguising themselves as civilians.\n\nA local resident rides a bike near destroyed houses in the village of Arkhanhelske, Kherson region. Photograph: Reuters\n\nThe destruction of the bridges, however, suggested that Russian forces were preparing to abandon the positions that they occupied on western side of the Dnipro River.\n\nUkrainian officials and local residents said that at least four bridges had been blown up on Wednesday to slow the Ukrainian advance. Among these was the Dariivka Bridge, the only crossing across the Inhulets river in the Russian-occupied western-bank part of Kherson oblast.\n\nThe Inhulets divides the occupied area into two, with the city of Kherson in the western part and Beryslav in the east.\n\nImages posted on social media also showed two bridges over the canal in Snihurivka had collapsed. Snihurivika has been a key Russian position, anchoring its defences outside Kherson.",

                "cc_text": "BUDAPEST -- Recent allegations of China operating 54 overseas \"police stations\" to pressure its citizens -- including dissidents -- to return home have sparked controversy and led to a number of investigations into their activities across Europe and North America.\n\nBut in Hungary and Serbia -- two countries where Beijing is said to operate such facilities and whose governments prize their warming political and economic ties with China -- the new findings are being met with swift denials by authorities despite a growing array of evidence and calls for probes.\n\n\"[These] Chinese overseas police [stations] usually just offer their help [to citizens], but they're also signaling that Chinese surveillance is present even here,\" Marton Tompos, a Hungarian lawmaker from the opposition Momentum party, told RFE/RL.\n\nTompos made headlines in October when he investigated the locations of two alleged Chinese police stations in Budapest following a September report by the Spain-based NGO Safeguard Defenders that detailed 21 overseas Chinese stations -- most of them in Europe.\n\nAccording to the report, the stations are overseas operations of the public security bureaus from two Chinese provinces and are used to persuade citizens to return to China, including through pressure on family members at home. While most of those involved appear to be suspected of crimes such as telecommunications fraud or corruption, dissidents have also reported that the stations have been used to monitor and threaten them.\n\nFourteen governments have already launched investigations into the overseas police stations, and the Dutch and Irish governments have ordered China to shut down the facilities in their countries.\n\nIn Budapest, Tompos visited two stations in the Hungarian capital operating in areas home to the city's sizable Chinese diaspora.\n\nIn a video, he documented one building that had three large billboards that had the name and logo of the Qingtian Overseas Police Station, one of the Chinese regions mentioned in the Safeguard Defenders report. Tompos says he was unable to contact personnel at either station and when he visited again several days later that the sign had been removed.\n\n\"The fact that they have put three large billboards on one of their offices shows they were not afraid of being exposed,\" Tompos said.\n\nSweep It Under The Rug'\n\nHungary and Serbia have become China's closest partners in Europe in recent years, with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic building stronger political relationships with Beijing and courting Chinese investment and business ties under the umbrella of its expansive infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nIn response to Tompos's findings and the Safeguard Defenders report, the Hungarian Interior Ministry told RFE/RL in an e-mail that \"there is no Chinese police station operating in Hungary.\"\n\nSerbian officials have also been silent on the allegations.\n\nThe Serbian Interior Ministry did not respond to RFE/RL's request for comment, and Serbian and Chinese officials refused to take questions from the media at a recent event in Belgrade.\n\n\"I believe that [the Serbian government] will look to sweep it under the rug,\" Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, told RFE/RL, adding that Belgrade is careful not to jeopardize its relationship with Beijing.\n\nIn the Safeguard Defenders report, the Chinese station in Belgrade is also mentioned as the site of a documented case of forced return. Citing Chinese government documents, the NGO says that in 2018 a Chinese national who lived in Belgrade and is identified only as Xia was accused of theft in China and \"persuaded to return.\"\n\nAccording to the report, he was identified by the Belgrade station and contacted over the Chinese messaging platform WeChat, where he was eventually \"convinced\" to return to China after initially being reluctant to leave Serbia.\n\nThe case was not previously known in Serbia and authorities there have not published any details or answered questions about it since the report's release.\n\nPavle Grbovic, an opposition Serbian lawmaker who sits on parliament's Security Services Control Committee, told RFE/RL that he believes there are grounds to launch an investigation into the activities of Chinese police stations in Serbia and says he will raise the issue during the committee's next session.\n\nSerbia and China signed a 2019 agreement that allowed for joint police patrols between the two countries, permitting Chinese officers to work alongside their Serbian counterparts to deal with an influx of tourists and workers from China in recent years. Grbovic says the recent allegations now warrant more scrutiny of this arrangement.\n\n\"Regardless of the fact that there is a position officially issued by the Serbian Interior Ministry that [Chinese officers] don't have full police powers [in Serbia], the question still remains as to what they're doing on the streets of Belgrade,\" he said.\n\nTompos said the Hungarian Interior Ministry's denials are dishonest, pointing to a wealth of articles in Chinese media -- and even statements from Chinese authorities -- describing the station's existence in Budapest and its engagement in various policing issues in Hungary. It even mentions some officers by name for solving robberies and resolving document issues.\n\nIn another instance, Chinese media referred to an officer named Wang Deging, who is mentioned as executive vice president of the Hungary-China Police Exchange Association and as the Hungarian-Chinese police liaison officer with Hungary's Interior Ministry.\n\nHiding In Plain Sight\n\nChinese officials have not denied the existence of such facilities, although Beijing says they were set up to provide essential services to Chinese citizens overseas.\n\nServices such as passport renewals or visa requests are typically handled by an embassy or consulate, and diplomatic rules apply in these locations. Policing outposts like the ones China is accused of running could violate the territorial integrity of a host country by crossing national jurisdictions and the protections afforded under domestic law.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party wants to exert a comparable level of control over the Chinese people abroad as they do domestically,\" Martin Hala, a China expert at Charles University in Prague and the director of Sinopsis, a project that tracks Chinese influence across Europe, told RFE/RL. \"Attempts to police and punish people of Chinese descent overseas are not new [and Beijing] has no qualms about extending their institutions to other, typically unsuspecting, jurisdictions.\"\n\nMultiple governments and human rights groups have documented instances of China's transnational repression in recent years. Examples include campaigns to extradite Uyghurs back to China's western Xinjiang Province, where they have been interned in a vast camp system, efforts to repatriate citizens accused of crimes back home, and a campaign against pro-democracy activists from the mainland and Hong Kong.\n\nExact figures are unknown, but thousands of Chinese dissidents or those fleeing repression have been coerced into returning to China, while hundreds of thousands more are believed to have been pressured to go back in part due to the efforts of overseas police stations.\n\nDu Hangwei, China's deputy public security minister, said in June that the government had \"persuaded\" 210,000 people to return in the past year alone to face charges for telecommunications fraud.\n\n\"For a lot of people, it stretches the imagination that a country -- any country -- might possibly attempt to run their own police stations in other states without the knowledge of local authorities,\" said Hala. \"I think the biggest lesson from this whole affair is [that] the entire concept of [what is taking place] is so brazen and, frankly, incredible, that people [and governments] struggle to make total sense out of it.\"\n\nWritten and reported by Reid Standish in Prague based on reporting by Akos Keller-Alant in Budapest and Mila Durdevic in Belgrade",

They put a bag over his head, bundled him into a car and drove him around the southern city for hours, threatening to kill him.\n\nFedorov, 34, is one of more than 50 local leaders who have been held in Russian captivity since the war began Feb. 24 in an attempt to subdue cities and towns coming under Moscows control. Like many others, he said he was pressured to collaborate with the invaders.\n\n\"The bullying and threats did not stop for a minute. They tried to force me to continue leading the city under the Russian flag, but I refused,\" Fedorov told the Associated Press by phone last month in Kyiv. \"They didnt beat me, but day and night, wild screams from the next cell would tell me what was waiting for me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Russians seized parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, civilian administrators and others, including nuclear power plant workers, say they have been abducted, threatened or beaten to force their cooperation something that legal and human rights experts say may constitute a war crime.\n\nUkrainian and Western historians say the tactic is used when invading forces are unable to subjugate the population.\n\nThis year, as Russian forces sought to tighten their hold on Melitopol, hundreds of residents took to the streets to demand Fedorovs release. After six days in detention and an intervention from President Volodymyr Zelensky, he was exchanged for nine Russian prisoners of war and expelled from the occupied city. A pro-Kremlin figure was installed.\n\n\"The Russians cannot govern the captured cities. They have neither the personnel nor the experience,\" Fedorov said. They want to force public officials to work for them because they realize that someone has to \"clean the streets and fix up the destroyed houses.\"\n\nThe Assn. of Ukrainian Cities, or AUC, a group of local leaders from across Ukraine, said that of the more than 50 abducted officials, including 34 mayors, at least 10 remain captive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian officials havent commented on the allegations. Moscow-backed authorities in eastern Ukraine even launched a criminal investigation into Fedorov on charges of involvement in terrorist activities.\n\n\"Kidnapping the heads of villages, towns and cities, especially in wartime, endangers all residents of a community, because all critical management, provision of basic amenities and important decisions on which the fate of thousands of residents depends are entrusted to the communitys head,\" said Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, head of the AUC.\n\nIn the southern city of Kherson, one of the first seized by Russia and a key target of an unfolding counteroffensive, Mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev tried to stand his ground. He said in April that he would refuse to cooperate with the citys new Kremlin-backed overseer.\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed regional administration, repeatedly denounced Kolykhaiev as a \"Nazi,\" echoing the false Kremlin narrative that its attack on Ukraine was an attempt to \"de-Nazify\" the country.\n\nKolykhaiev continued to supervise Khersons public utilities until his arrest June 28. His whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, 407 forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of civilians were recorded in areas seized by Russia in the first six months of the war. Most were civil servants, local councilors, civil society activists and journalists.\n\nWorld & Nation Russia rejoins wartime deal allowing Ukrainian grain exports Moscow had suspended its participation in an agreement that allowed the shipment of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea.\n\nYulia Gorbunova, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the abuse \"violates international law and may constitute a war crime,\" adding that Russian forces actions appeared to be aimed at \"obtaining information and instilling fear.\"\n\nThe U.N. human rights office has warned repeatedly that arbitrary detentions and forced disappearances are among possible war crimes committed in Ukraine.\n\nSeveral mayors have been killed, shocking Ukrainian society. Following the discovery of mass burials in areas recaptured by Kyiv, Ukrainian and foreign investigators continue to uncover details of extrajudicial killings of mayors.\n\nThe body of Olga Sukhenko, who headed the village of Motyzhyn, near Kyiv, was found in a mass grave next to those of her husband and son after Russian forces retreated. The village, with a prewar population of about 1,000, is a short drive from Bucha, which saw hundreds of civilians killed under Russian occupation.\n\nResidents said Sukhenko had refused to cooperate with the Russians. When her body was unearthed on the outskirts of Motyzhyn, her hands were found tied behind her back.\n\nMayor Yurii Prylypko of nearby Hostomel was gunned down in March while handing out food and medicine. The prosecutor generals office later said his body was found rigged with explosives.\n\nUkraines government has tried to swap captive officials for Russian POWs, but officials complain that Moscow sometimes demands Kyiv release hundreds of Russians for each Ukrainian in a position of authority, prolonging negotiations.\n\n\"Its such a difficult job that any superfluous word can get in the way of our exchange,\" said Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraines human rights commissioner. \"We know the places where prisoners are kept, as well as the appalling conditions in which they are kept.\"\n\nThere has been no news about the fate of Ivan Samoydyuk, the deputy mayor of Enerhodar, site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Samoydyuk, abducted in March, has repeatedly been considered for a prisoner swap, but his name was struck off the list each time, Mayor Dmytro Orlov told the AP.\n\nThe 58-year-old deputy mayor was seriously ill when seized, Orlov said, and \"we dont even know if hes alive.\" At best, Samoydyuk is sitting in a basement somewhere, \"and his life depends on the whim of people with guns,\" he added.\n\nMore than 1,000 Enerhodar residents, including dozens of workers at Zaporizhzhia, Europes largest nuclear plant, were detained by the Russians at one time or another.\n\n\"The vast majority of those who came out of the Russian cellars speak of brutal beatings and electric shocks,\" he said.\n\nNewsletter News Alerts Get breaking news, investigations, analysis and more signature journalism from the Los Angeles Times in your inbox.

The film explores the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014. Although the film didnt win an Oscar, it cemented Marunyaks salt-of-the-earth reputation.\n\nAfter Russian troops seized Stara Zburivka in spring, Marunyak held pro-Ukrainian rallies and hid some activists in his home. He was eventually taken prisoner.\n\n\"At first, they put [electrical] wires on my thumbs. Then it seemed not enough for them, and they put them on my big toes. And they poured water on my head so it would flow down my back,\" he told the AP. \"Honestly, I was so beaten up that I didnt have any impressions from the electric current.\"\n\nAfter 23 days, Marunyak was \"released to die,\" he said. Hospitalized for 10 days with pneumonia and nine broken ribs, he finally left for territory controlled by Kyiv.\n\nHubertus Jahn, a history professor at Cambridge University, said that from the time of Peter the Great onward, the tactic of imperialist Russia of co-opting locals targeted elites and nobility, with resistance often bringing Siberian exile.\n\nDuring World War II, he said, \"German SS units operated in a similar way,\" by targeting local administrators in order to pressure residents into submission. Jahn called it an obvious strategy \"if you dont have the strength to subordinate a region outright.\"\n\nHistorian Ivan Patryliuk of Kyivs Taras Shevchenko National University said municipal authorities in Soviet Ukraine often fled before Nazi occupation forces arrived, which \"helped avoid mass executions of officials.\"\n\n\"The kind of torture and humiliation [of] city leaders that the Russians are now perpetrating ... is one of the darkest and most shameful pages of the current war,\" Patryliuk said.",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON -- Ukrainian troops smashed through Russian forces in the northeast Kharkiv region in September, a stunning counteroffensive driven by Ukrainian determination, shrewd battlefield tactics, and powerful Western weaponry.\n\nThe United States has supplied more weaponry, financial support, and other aid than all other NATO allies combined: more than $60 billion since Russia invaded in February, launching the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nThat support has persisted despite deep partisan divisions in Washington, D.C., rifts that have been on full display in the election campaign for Congress, which culminates in the November 8 vote.\n\nBut while Russia's war has not topped Americans' concerns, a growing number of Republican lawmakers -- and a smaller number of Democrats -- have voiced misgivings about an open-ended financial commitment to Ukraine.\n\nPolls show Republicans are poised to gain control of the House of Representatives, all of whose 435 seats are up for grabs. Control of the Senate, where 34 of 100 seats are being contested, is an open question, with just a handful of seats determining who will set the chamber's agenda. Democrats have controlled both chambers since 2020.\n\nRepublican leaders say U.S. commitment to Ukraine cannot be unlimited.\n\n\"I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,\" Representative Kevin McCarthy, who will become leader of the House if Republicans take control, said in an interview with interview with Punchbowl News.\n\nAs House speaker, McCarthy would have wide latitude to appoint Ukraine-skeptic lawmakers as the chairs of the budgetary and the foreign affairs committees, as well as the power to decide which bills come up for a vote.\n\nPreelection polls show record inflation, gasoline prices, rising crime rates, a looming recession, and other economic issues top the lists of American concerns, issues traditionally viewed as strengths for Republicans. The Ukraine war, Russia's nuclear saber-rattling, and other foreign policy issues have been little seen in election campaigns across the country or in the ads flooding Americans' TV sets.\n\nStill, a small number of congressional lawmakers have publicly questioned President Joe Biden's surge of weapons to Ukraine.\n\nIn May, the House voted 368-57 in favor of a bill allocating $40 billion in aid to Ukraine. All 57 votes in opposition were from Republicans.\n\nThe bill ultimately cleared the Senate, but the vote was a sign of discontent by a vocal wing of the Republican Party critical of years of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nJohn Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Kyiv, called McCarthy's comments concerning but did not expect Republican control of one or both chambers of Congress to materially affect support for Ukraine.\n\n\"I am confident that we will continue to send substantial aid to Ukraine,\" said Herbst, who is now an analyst at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n\"A little bit less to my mind is plausible because we are giving them so much, but I'd be surprised if there was a major drop in our support,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\nThe majority of Republicans \"seem to understand in their gut the need for military assistance,\" he said.\n\nIf the Republicans take control of the Senate, meanwhile, Mitch McConnell will become that chamber's leader. The long-serving senator has been more forceful in his public statements in support of Ukraine.\n\n\"Assisting Ukraine is not some feel-good symbolic gesture. It is literally an investment in our own national security and that of our allies,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor in September.\n\n\"The Biden Administration and our allies need to do more to supply the tools Ukraine needs to thwart Russian aggression,\" McConnell said.\n\nDemocratic Doubts\n\nIt's not just Republicans voicing doubts.\n\nLast month, 30 Democratic House lawmakers who make up the left-wing Congressional Progressive Caucus sent a letter to Biden calling for his administration to, among other things, negotiate with the Kremlin to end the war.\n\nThe letter, which had been drafted months earlier, before Ukraine's counteroffensive in Kharkiv, was retracted days later, following criticism from fellow Democrats, including some of the signatories themselves.\n\nStill, any indications that Republicans -- or Democrats -- are getting cold feet on more aid to Ukraine could embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"U.S. messaging is critical for influencing Moscow's calculus in Ukraine,\" Rob Lee, a former U.S. Marine and military expert at King's College London, said in an October 24 tweet. \"If the Kremlin thinks the U.S. is committed to long-term support to Ukraine, it will be more likely to negotiate sooner.\"\n\nRepresentative Mike Turner, who is set to take over the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee if Republicans win control, said that \"no one in Republican leadership has called for an end to aid for Ukraine.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Kyiv on November 3, Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Chris Coons both reiterated U.S. support for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and said it would continue regardless of the outcome of the midterm elections.\n\n\"I am confident that bipartisan robust American support for the fight of the Ukrainian people will continue in Congress,\" Coons told reporters later.\n\nBread-And-Butter, Not Guns-And-Butter\n\nOpinion polls asking Americans their views on Ukraine provide a mixed picture.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by Pew Research in September, a growing number of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters say Washington is providing too much aid to Ukraine: 32 percent in September compared with 17 percent in March. Among Democrats, 11 percent say the United States is providing too much support, up from 8 percent in May.\n\nOverall, the poll found about 18 percent of Americans think Washington is not providing enough support -- down from 42 percent from March.\n\nSome lawmakers have voiced concern about how U.S. aid is being used by Ukraine, a reflection of the country's reputation for endemic corruption and weak rule of law.\n\nDaniel Vajdich, whose Washington-based firm Yorktown Solutions has lobbied on behalf of Ukraine, said Kyiv should do \"a better job\" explaining how it is using the aid, especially in the nonmilitary sphere.\n\nUkraine will have to take a more \"nuanced\" approach in the messaging when lobbying Republicans and Democrats, he said.\n\nRecession Looms\n\nThe November 8 vote is called the midterm election because it falls midway into the four-year term of Biden, a Democrat. Historically, the party that controls the White House nearly always loses seats in Congress in the midterms.\n\nAlso historically, economic issues are the main drivers for American voters.\n\nIf the U.S. economy sinks into a recession in the coming months as many economists expect, support for such high levels of aid for Ukraine could weaken further.\n\nStill, evidence of Russian war crimes could offset Ukraine fatigue in the West, said William Courtney, a former U.S. ambassador and analyst at the RAND Corporation, a Washington-based think tank funded in part by the U.S. Defense Department.\n\n\"As Ukrainians take more land that's been occupied by the Russians and atrocities are uncovered, this will bolster political support for Ukraine in the United States and Europe,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\n\"As long as Ukrainian forces maintain battlefield momentum, there's no sign that even with some shifts -- for instance, if the Republicans take control of the House -- that this will affect the amount of aid,\" Courtney said.\n\nFearful of a cutback under Republican control, some backers have pushed for locking down more Ukraine aid in December, before the new Congress formally begins work the following month. The aid would be part of a larger spending bill to ensure weapons and humanitarian aid continue well into 2023.\n\nMembers of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, a diaspora organization, will travel to Washington after the election to lobby for additional aid this year.\n\nSpokesman Andrij Dobrianskiy said the council is also encouraging Ukrainians living in the United States -- estimated at more than 1 million people -- to meet with their representatives following the election and encourage them to visit the country.\n\n\"We would want to make sure that the aid to Ukraine is ongoing no matter what happens,\" he told RFE/RL. \"Get them to Ukraine. That is the No. 1 advocacy tool for Ukraine.\"\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL Correspondent Mike Eckel in Prague, and AP",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Ukrainian military's General Staff said in its daily update that Russian troops in the east continued their attacks on Bakhmut, Avdiyivka, and Novopavlivka, the focal points of Moscow's offensive in Donetsk in recent weeks.\n\nAt the same time, the military said, Russian troops continue to shell critical infrastructure and civilian objectives in various regions of Ukraine.\n\nIn his regular video address, Zelenskiy on November 7 called the intense combat in the Donetsk region \"the epicenter of the biggest madness of the occupiers.\"\n\n\"They are dying in hundreds every day,\" Zelenskiy said. \"The ground in front of the Ukrainian positions is literally littered with the bodies of the occupiers.\"\n\nZelenskiy also said that Russian soldiers in the Pavlivka area had complained to the governor of their region in the Russian Far East.\n\nCNN reported on November 7 that in a letter purportedly sent from the front lines to Primorsky region Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, the men of the 155th Brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet Marines say they were thrown into an \"incomprehensible battle\" in the Donetsk and had lost about 300 men, dead and wounded, in four days, while also losing 50 percent of their equipment.\n\nZelenskiy said that in response to the letter, Kozhemyako had said that the losses were \"not that big\" and they were \"exaggerated.\"\n\nIn Kherson, the only pocket of Russian-held territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine, Moscow has ordered civilians out of the city in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city.\n\nKherson, with a prewar population of nearly 300,000, has no power or running water, both sides said.\n\nRussian-installed officials blamed Ukrainian \"sabotage,\" while Ukrainian officials said the Russians had dismantled 1 1/2 kilometers of power lines.\n\nUkraine's military said Russian forces, \"disguised in civilian clothes, occupy the premises of civilians and strengthen positions inside for conducting street battles.\"\n\nRussian forces were \"involved in looting and theft from residents and from infrastructure sites and are taking away equipment, food, and vehicles to the Russian Federation,\" it said in an update late on November 7.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported hits on a Russian antiaircraft facility, ammunition dump, and the destruction of Russian armor in the Beryslav district of the Kherson region, in its November 8 statement. It said 32 Russian military personnel were killed.\n\nThe information could not be independently confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelenskiy said the escalation of Russian missile strikes against critical infrastructure in his country has only resulted in the world responding with new aid to Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has received \"new systems that significantly strengthen our air defense,\" Zelenskiy said on November 7 in his nightly address. Kyiv will do everything \"to ensure that as many countries as possible join this aid,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the protection of the Ukrainian sky was \"not 100 percent, but we are gradually moving toward our goal.\"\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov announced earlier on November 7 that Ukraine had received a shipment of NASAMS and Apside air defense systems to help it defend against Russian missile and drone attacks across the country.\n\n\"These weapons will significantly strengthen #UAarmy and will make our skies safer,\" he said on Twitter. Reznikov did not specify which countries the systems were from, but in the tweet he thanked \"our partners: Norway, Spain and the U.S.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and CNN",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"There is no information about their fate,\" Arghandiwal said of the commandos who have joined Wagner, and there has been no confirmation from Kyiv or elsewhere that Afghan soldiers have reached the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nRussia initially occupied wide swathes of Ukraine following its full-scale of invasion in February but has for months suffered significant troop and territorial losses due largely to a two-pronged Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nThe setbacks, which have left Russia trying to hold the line in parts of southern and eastern Ukraine that it still occupies and claims as its own, have forced the Kremlin to introduce a military draft and to increasingly rely on mercenaries from Wagner and Chechen troops to replenish its depleted forces.\n\nArghandiwal says he was personally informed of the recruitment drive by \"hundreds\" of his former troops. \"The Russians, through the Wagner security company and in cooperation with the host country [Iran], where the majority of Afghanistan's security and defense forces are [now] located, as well as some Afghans who previously moved to Iran and Russia, are trying to recruit commandos,\" he said.\n\nThe Afghan general said that former members of the Afghan National Army, the Afghan National Police, and other former security forces are next in line for recruitment to be taken to Russia and then on to fight in Ukraine.\n\nTens of thousands of Afghan troops and security personnel were trained by the U.S. military during the nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan that ended with a chaotic withdrawal of foreign forces and the Taliban retaking power in Kabul in August 2021. Fearing retribution by the Taliban, many members of Afghanistan's army, police, as well as military and intelligence officers loyal to the ousted government fled to Iran, Pakistan, and other countries.\n\nThe U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) reported in May that even before the fall of Kabul \"around 3,000 Afghan security forces consisting of high-ranking officers to foot soldiers, along with their military equipment and vehicles, crossed the border into Iran,\" although many returned to Afghanistan after the Taliban offered a general amnesty.\n\nShortly after the Taliban returned to power, Iran reportedly offered temporary visas to Afghans who could prove they served in the Afghan military.\n\nWhile more than 80,000 at-risk Afghans who worked or fought alongside U.S. and other Western forces were airlifted out as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, tens of thousands were left behind in Afghanistan, where more than 100 extrajudicial killings of former military and government workers were recorded within the first months of Taliban rule, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nThe situation led to concerns by U.S. military and political leaders that Washington was not doing enough to evacuate Afghans who fought against the Taliban, opening the possibility that an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 U.S.-trained troops would have no alternative but to join the Taliban or a regional adversary.\n\nIn August, a Republican-led U.S. congressional investigation critical of the U.S. withdrawal singled out the risk posed to the United States by former Afghan forces who fled to Iran, \"due to the fact these Afghan personnel know the U.S. military and intelligence community's tactics, techniques, and procedures.\"\n\nOutraged at the large number of Afghan troops who were not airlifted out of Afghanistan in the last days of the U.S.-led war, multiple groups led by U.S. veterans of the war were launched to help get their Afghan allies out of the country.\n\nMike Edwards, a former trainer of Afghan special forces who formed the volunteer organization Exodus Relief, told RFE/RL in March that \"these guys are left with no other option but to either get killed or, if they are lucky, to get recruited to the other side.\" If they choose the latter, Edwards said, it would mean having \"some of the best we've ever trained working against us.\"\n\nArghandiwal says the Iranian authorities were giving Afghan special forces who moved to Iran an ultimatum to either return to Afghanistan or fight for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nRFE/RL was unable to independently verify Arghandiwal's claims.\n\nForeign Policy reported last week that Afghan commandos were being recruited to fight in Ukraine, citing former fighters as saying they were being contacted on the messaging services WhatsApp and Signal. A military source told the magazine that up to 10,000 former Afghan commandos could be willing to accept the offer from Wagner.\n\nAP reported this week that members of the Afghan special forces were being lured with the promise of $1,500 a month and safe haven for their family members. The news agency quoted one former Afghan commando currently in Iran as saying that about 400 fellow fighters were considering joining Wagner and he believed many would.\n\nThe former commando said many of his fellow soldiers felt abandoned by Washington, and that his offer included visas to Russia for him as well as for his children and wife, who are in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Wagner group has been involved in Russia's war in Ukraine from the beginning, with reports early in the conflict suggesting the mercenary group was offering Syrians $3,000 a month to join the fight.\n\nUkrainian intelligence said as many as 40,000 Syrians were preparing to side with Russian forces in Ukraine, but only a few hundred Syrians are believed to have actually reached the battlefield and the recruitment effort was eventually widely dismissed as Russian disinformation.\n\nThe potential impact of Afghan commandos -- considered to be highly skilled and trained combat fighters -- if they fight in Ukraine is disputed. A former senior Afghan security official suggested to Foreign Policy that their entry into the Russia-Ukraine war \"would be a game-changer\" for the Kremlin's war effort.\n\nSergei Danilov, deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Center for Middle East Studies, said in an interview with Current Time that he had no doubt Russia was trying to recruit Afghans. But he said Afghan forces were too scattered to be recruited in large numbers to form a united fighting force, and noted their failures in defending Afghanistan against the Taliban.\n\n\"They are trained, but they are absolutely not motivated,\" Danilov said. \"They don't pose a threat. Some were able to go to Pakistan -- or even to Iran -- and are now in the region and beyond.... But this is not tens of thousands or even thousands.\"\n\nMichael Scollon and Current Time contributed to this report",

                "cc_text": "The Russo-Ukrainian War and the Principles of Urban Operations\n\nAmos C. Fox\n\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War provides an overwhelming amount of information for the curious researcher and analyst. Wading through the information is a daunting task because of the surfeit of open-source information. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that much of the conflicts detailed information, to include policy decisions, military strategies, planning documents, casualty counts, and detailed accounts of battles, are secreted away in secure information storage networks.\n\nUrban Warfare Damage, Irpin, Kyiv Oblast, 22 June 2022.\n\nSource: US Embassy, Kyiv, Ukraine (CC BY-ND 2.0)\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo not fall victim to the traps of incomplete information, this paper analyzes the conflicts urban operations at arms length and does not over-infer from existing information on tactical activity. This paper broadly examines urban operations in Ukraine through the lens of DOTMLPF-P (doctrine, organization, training, material, leadership, personnel, facilities, and policy). This paper does not examine the entire scope of DOTMLPF-P, but uses the conflicts character to examine Western doctrine, training, and organization considerations. This paper does not use every urban battle from the conflict, but instead focuses on the battle of Kyiv and the siege of Mariupol as data points.\n\nUrban operations in Ukraine demonstrate that large-scale conflicts between modern state actors are attritional wars which require one side to strategically exhaust the other to reign victorious. Exhaustion is the aggregated effect operations, resource expenditure, and mobilized bases of power, against a competing belligerent and the international system. The Russo-Ukrainian War demonstrates that strategic exhaustion is hard to come by. Despite suffering over 70,000 killed in action, and thousands of losses in tanks, artillery, and other vital combat systems, Russia continues to vigorously defy the international community, international norms, international humanitarian law (IHL), and the law of armed conflict (LOAC) with its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Conversely, Ukraines political and military acumen demonstrates that the identification, activation, and maintenance of power is germane to persevering in an attritional war against a numerically, and resource, superior opponent.\n\nThe battles of Kyiv and the siege of Mariupol are examined to support this papers thesis and to link the thesis with reflections on Western doctrine, training, and organization. Before doing so, however, this paper reviews the uniqueness of urban environments because they fuel different tactical and operational considerations than open environments, like in the deserts of the Middle East, or across the plains of central Europe.\n\nNext, this paper asserts that Western militaries must distance themselves from maneuver-centric thinking, resourcing, and organizations because the rigors of urban warfare, require resilient forces, a robust industrial base, and networked sustainment to insulate against quick collapse. Western militaries must invest in doctrine, training, and organizations that account for large resource expenditures in offensive and defensive operations, waging and breaking sieges, and opponents willing to expend vast amounts of men and materiel in pursuit of their political aims.\n\nThis paper continues by providing a set of guiding principles of urban operations. The principles of urban warfare provided in this paper are derived from the concerns and observations identified in the Russo-Ukrainian Wars urban battles. These principles are the product of urban warfares uniqueness, and from observations on urban warfare from urban combat in Ukraine, and help address doctrine, training, and organization shortfalls in Western military thinking.\n\nUrban Environments\n\nTo understand the Russo-Ukrainian Wars urban battles, it is imperative to understand urban environments. At the most basic level, urban environments are incubators of destruction to military forces, to resources, to the civilian population, and to civilian infrastructure. Urban environments are incubators of destruction because a citys tight streets, dense infrastructure, and large populations check tactical mobility, truncate a forces ability to conduct maneuver warfare, and correspondingly increases the likelihood of linear engagements of methodical destruction and positional fighting.[1]\n\nManeuver Warfare An Inappropriate Solution for Urban War-fighting\n\nUrban environments invite positional warfighting and sieges. Urban environments canalizing terrain mandates that land forces, when committed into an urban area, operate in a generally deterministic direction linked to an enemys location. As a result, determinism in urban battle fetters the potential for tactical maneuver through the denial of the conditions needed for maneuver. For maneuvers realization, a force must be mobile and able to quickly advance against an enemy along multiple routes. Useful reconnaissance works like a pivot point from which a maneuvering force moves and fights, at distance, as it indirectly works toward the attainment of its military objective at its opponents flanks and rear.\n\nManeuver also requires quick decision cycles. The speed at which a force can move through transition cycles in affected in large part by the number of variables it must address. Urban environments present a far greater number of variables, as well as the type of variables, for a force to account for. The high number and type of variables slows both decision-making and movement, while increasing the amount and diversity of preparatory work and environmental shaping needed to increase ones chances for success.\n\nAside from confounding maneuver warfare, urban environments stymy brisk offensive action. Military operations in urban areas are ordinarily ponderous affairs because the attacking force must move deliberately to protect itself from the dangers lurking within a citys complex terrain. Moreover, concerns for international humanitarian law (IHL) and the law of armed conflict (LOAC) cause a law-abiding combatant to temper the speed of their operations and to intervene more cautiously than they would in open terrain.\n\nDislocation The Art and Science of Rendering Military Strength Irrelevant\n\nUrban environments dislocate armed forces, especially those that do not intend to fight within a city. Dislocation is the result of making a military forces strength irrelevant.[2] Military strength is contingent on two dependent variables: war-fighting components and conditions. Components are the tools of warweapons systems, units, communication networks, sustainment systems, resources, and command nodes. Conditions are environments and situations that favor a combatants components.[3]\n\nDislocation is positional, foundational, temporal, or moral. Positional dislocation is the effect achieved when a combatant cannot overcome the challenges of fighting in a location for which it is ill-suited.[4] Functional dislocation is the consequence when a combatant is unable to successfully compensate for being forced to fight in a method that does not align with how it prefers to fight or for how it was built, trained, and resourced to fight.[5]Temporal dislocation is the repercussion generated when a combatant is unable to overcome the challenge associated with being unable to operate at the pace it prefers.[6] Moral dislocation is the effect caused when a combatant is unable to overcome the unnerving impact of a crestfallen situation.\n\nThe forms of dislocation are not exclusive; in fact, perfect dislocation results from a combatant being lured into all four of the concepts forms. A military unit under siege, like the Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal industrial plant (discussed later) are an example of perfect dislocation. The Ukrainian forces at Azovstal were positionally, functionally, and temporally dislocated. The Ukrainian forces dire situation at Azovstal facilitated moral dislocation, which was demonstrated by the surrender of the Ukrainians remaining 1,730 defenders.[7]\n\nNonetheless, perfect dislocation is challenging to generate. This is because significant time, resources, and coordination must come together to cause all four forms of dislocation first materialize, and then to subsequently congeal into an inexorable situation. More often dislocation comes in a combination of two forms.\n\nTanks provides a helpful analog to illustrate a practical example of dislocation. Tanks are built to operate in open terrain, move quickly, and fight from afar. The USs most tactically successful commander, General George Patton, channeling combined arms theory, instructs the student and practitioner of warfare that tanks do not exist to fight other tanks. Instead, tanks must sprint around a combatants flanks, get to their rear area, and assail artillery forces, headquarters, sustainment outposts, and other rear area elements.[8]\n\nOpen terrain allows a tank to swiftly move and maximize the use of its gun, which can engage opponents up to 3,000 meters away.[9] A tank in an urban environment, however, is limited to slow movement, using its main gun at a fraction of its ideal range, and is unable to elevate its gun to engage targets in buildings greater than one or two floors. When a single tank is aggregated to the battalion, brigade, or division level, an armored organization finds that their capabilities are severely degraded in the urban environment. An armored formation is relegated to slow movement along a definable number of congested routes. Further, an armored formation is unable to maximize the use of its weapons because of the deterministic nature of civilian infrastructure on an armored force. In sum, urban areas often positionally, functionally, and temporally dislocate armored forces. This theoretical concept helps explain many of the problems Russian land forces experienced during their urban battles with light, mobile Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn addition to the problems caused for traditional land forces, the urban battlefield decreases the advantages of joint force integration. A panoply of overhead strike aircraft, sensors, reconnaissance drones, and airborne early warning and control aircraft find their jobs considerably more challenging in urban areas.[10] This is because the physical terrain frustrates surveillance, targeting, and the success rate of first-strike aerial and land-based cannon, rocket, and missile strikes.\n\nNevertheless, a combatant may elect to not enter an urban area. Instead, the combatant may occupy the space around a city and do one of two things. The combatant may opt to encircle the city and wait out the ensconced opponent. Or the combatant may elect to pound its opponent into submission through deleterious bombardment. In each case, the criteria for a siege encircle and wait, or encircle and bombardis met.[11]\n\nLines of Communication Still Matter\n\nAn urban environments final consideration regards the significance of important infrastructure. Russia, for instance, requires significant railroad exchange points and depots because its logistics network is built on a non-palletized bulk supply distribution system.]12] This necessitates having to push non-palletized materials from Russia via rail and truck to forward distribution points. At those distribution points, Russian supplies are manually downloaded, sorted, and either repackaged and reloaded for movement to further frontline units, or collected to form field depots.[13] As a result, battles materialize in urban areas because rail and highways converge in cities, and not in rural locations.\n\nFurther, battles develop in these areas because one belligerent wants to possess the airport, railroad, and highway infrastructure, while the other combatant wants to deny these facilities to the former. The 2014-2015 Donbas campaigns sieges of Luhansk Airport, Ilovaisk, Donetsk Airport, and Debaltseve all share this characteristic of urban warfare.[14] The Russo-Ukrainian Wars urban battles reinforce the points highlighted within the section. Thus far, many examples are available to explore the broad category of urban warfare, however, the struggles for Kyiv and Mariupol best support this works main thrust.\n\nUrban Operations in Ukraine: The Battle of Kyiv and the Siege of Mariupol\n\nThe Battle of Kyiv\n\nRussia attacked along two frontsone from Belarus and one from Belgorod, Russiato seize Kyiv and Kharkiv, respectively.[15] Two additional fronts - Crimea and the Donbas - carried forward from the 2014-2015 campaign. Simultaneously, attacks along Ukraines southern coast focused on taking control of seats of local and regional government, and cities where railway and highway networks converged. This situation resulted in significant urban battles in Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, Kherson, and Mykolaiv.[16]\n\nThe battle for Kyiv began in earnest on 24 February with Russias invasion of Ukraine. Official Russian policy and military strategy documents are unavailable to open-source query, but Russia intended to take control of Kyiv within the first 72 hours of the war.[17] Besides the commonly understood value in taking an enemys capital, Kyiv presented a set of valuable logistics hubs, to include ports on the Dnipro River, several airports, and a complex network of railroads and highways which linked Ukraine with Russia and Belarus.\n\nDuring Russias initial thrust at Kyiv, Russian forces attempted to capture the Antonov Airport.[18] Initial reports, captured on live television, pointed to Russian success at Antonov.[19] Ukrainian forces, however, quickly regained their balance and soundly defeated the Russian force that captured the airport.[20] Simultaneously, Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces from Kyiv and hardened the defense both inside and around Kyiv.[21] Russian forces made several attempts to penetrate Ukraines defense of Kyiv, succeeding at small scale penetrations and territorial acquisitions, but generally failing.[22]\n\nUkraines stalwart defense of the Antonov Airport temporally dislocated the Russian operational plan by denying Russias attempt to take Kyiv and win the war within 72 hours. By temporally dislocating the Russians operational plan, Ukraines operations forced Russia to take pause and reconfigure its strategy and its operational plan.[23]\n\nDuring Russian land and airborne forces feckless push to take Kyiv, Russian forces battered the city with a relentless bevy of artillery, rocket, missile, and air strikes.[24] Russias attack on Kyiv quickly demonstrated a disregard for IHL as strikes landed on civilian infrastructures, such as hospitals and apartment buildings, denying the local population access to essential needs and medical care.[25]\n\nMoreover, fighting raged in Kyivs suburbs. In the process, Russian forces inflicted severe retribution on the civilian population. The massacre at Bucha, in which over 500 civilians were tortured, killed, and buried in mass graves, is one of the most notable examples of this situation.[26] In legal terms, the Russian militarys actions in Bucha meet the threshold for war crimes.[27] Since 24 February 2022, Russian armed forces activity across Ukraine represents a clear violation of human rights, international law, international humanitarian law, as well as a wide range of additional war crimes.[28]\n\nThe battle of Kyiv demonstrates urban battles can quickly undue an aggressors timetable, or temporally dislocate the aggressor, causing significant challenges for their strategy and operational and tactical plans. Battles like that of Kyiv demonstrate that destructive battles of attrition generally accompany urban warfare because dislocation sets the dislocated on the path to destruction.\n\nThe Siege of Mariupol\n\nStrategically positioned along the Sea of Azov, Russian forces quickly sought Mariupol for its maritime importance, but because of the citys network of railway, highways, and industrial output. Further, Mariupol is the first stop along Russias long interest in a land-bridge to Crimea and Odessa. These geographic, military, and economic considerations resulted in the city playing an important part in Russias 2014-2015 campaign.[29]\n\nBy March, the United Nations (UN) gauged the fighting in Mariupol as the most hazardous anywhere in the country.[30] In fact, the UNs Human Rights Council reported that Mariupol was the deadliest location in the country between late February and April 2022.[31] Russian and Russian-proxy forces encircled Mariupol in early March and began an immediate siege of the city.[32] Russian and Russian-proxy forces cut basic utilities to Mariupol in early March, and they used starvation against combatants and non-combatants, alike.[33]\n\nFurther, Russian, and Russian-proxy forces, indiscriminately showered the city with what the UN characterized as wide area munitions. These munitions included tank and artillery fire, multiple launch rockets (MLRS), missiles, and air strikes. In one of the most glaring disregards for IHL, the Russian air force attacked a theater clearly marked children with devastating round of air strikes on 16 March 2022.[34] The attack not only destroyed the theater, but it killed 600 children that were sheltering in the theater.[35] Pleased with the atrocities doled out by Russian proxy forces in Mariupol, the head of the Donetsk Peoples Republic, Denis Pushilin, visited soldiers from the Donetsk Peoples Army in April 2022 and pinned decorations on their uniforms.[36]\n\nThe cityits defenders, its population, and its infrastructurecontinued to suffer grievously. By the end of April, Russian forces controlled all of Mariupol, except for the Azovstal industrial plant.[37] The Azovstal industrial plant provided the Ukrainian forces one last, defensible position within the city. Surrounded on three sides by water, Ukrainian forces occupied the facility in hopes of breaking the Russian siege against the fortress-like location.\n\nApproximately 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers fortified the plant, holding out for eighty days against 12,000 Russian and Russian-proxy troops.[38] More than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers were taken prisoner during the siege.[39] By the end of the siege, over ninety percent of the citys residential buildings, to include sixty percent of its private residences, are destroyed. Out of a pre-war population of 430,000 inhabitants, 350,000 of the citys peopleapproximately eight one percentfled.[40]\n\nIn both Kyiv and Mariupol, but also in other occupied regions of Ukraine, Russian forces are pulling Ukrainians from their homes and deporting them to Russia.[41] The UN reports that these attempts Russify Ukrainians and ethnically cleanse occupied areas are further illustrations of IHL violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Using the metrics developed by IHLs progenitor, Raphael Lemkin, Russias actions meet the standard for genocide. Lemkins baseline standards for genocide include two conditions: a) the destruction of one nations national identity by an oppressor, and b) the oppressor imposing its own national pattern on the oppressed nation.[42] Russias ruthless effort to eradicate Ukrainian nationality, Ukrainian culture, and Ukrainian people fits the pattern of practice persisted between the two actors throughout the twentieth century.[43]\n\nReflections\n\nAttrition An Uncomfortable Reality\n\nThe destructive urban battles and massive casualty numbers from the Russo-Ukrainian War clearly points to the fact that the conflict is an industrial war of attrition. Nonetheless, many less-than-factual narratives have emerged from the conflict suggesting that maneuver warfare is the reason for Ukraines success.[44]Despite the Wests unhealthy infatuation with maneuver warfare, battles like Kyiv and Mariupol represent a far different reality.\n\nObservers compound this problem by intercalating maneuver-centric tropes into nominal assessments of the conflict and its battles, which distorts the reality of the conflict. For instance, observers use Ukraines success to reinforce maneuver-centric advocacy without providing proof of maneuver, when positional and destruction-based warfighting is easy to verify.[45] Ukraine has killed over 76,000 Russian soldiers and wounded over 100,000 more in eight months of combat.[46] Russia, for its part, has killed upwards of 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers.[47] Maneuver warfare, urban or otherwise, is predicated on deft movement and limited destruction. The height of maneuver warfare, in fact, is predicated on forcing the enemy to cognitive paralysis thanks to placing it in such significant positions of disadvantage, that it has little recourse but to acquiesce.\n\nUkraine is not encircling Russian forces and hauling in massive unit surrenders. In fact, it has been quite the contrary. Words like destruction or degradation, coupled with staggering killed in action and casualty numbers, denote a war of attrition, not slick war of maneuver. Ukraines elimination of Russias 1st Guards Tank Army in September 2022 is a prime example of this point.[48] Through weeks of rigorous combat in the Kharkiv area, Ukrainian forces reduced the 1st Guards Tank Army to little more than a designation on a sheet of paper.[49] The destruction of the 1st Guards Tank Army hard suggests maneuver warfare.\n\nAdditionally, the Ukrainian forces systematic destruction of Russias 11th Army Corps during the summer of 2022 is another example that supports the assertion that is attrition is important to appreciate.[50] The 11th Army Corps, originally based on Kaliningrad, participated in significant combat in Ukraines Kharkiv region. Ukrainian counteroffensives, supported by US-supplied HIMARS, battered the 11th Army Corps into a shell of its former self, causing its remnants to beat a hasty retreat in September.[51] Unofficial Ukrainian reports contend that the corps suffered over fifty percent casualtiesa staggering number considering the 11th Army Corps personnel strength was likely close to 12,000 soldiers.[52] The Russian 11th Army Corps was not destroyed by deft Ukrainian left hook sweeping around the corps main body and triggering cognitive paralysis. The corps destruction was the result of the Ukrainian forces prodigious, and compounding, body blows against the Russian force.[53]\n\nWestern military must accept the reality of warattrition is how wars amongst industrialized nations are fought, won, and more importantly, lost. It is high time to elevate this idea from the catacombs of military thought. Attrition must assume its rightful position as a defining feature in the nature of war, otherwise the community of interest will continually be surprised when wars are not fought and won in quick battles of maneuver.\n\nElimination of Enemies on the Battlefield\n\nPrussia military theorist Carl von Clausewitz cautions the student and practitioner of war to remember that a hostile army in ones territory is a non-starter to domestic peace. To be sure, Clausewitz posits that, \"So long as I have not overthrown my opponent, I am bound to fear he may overthrow me.\"[54] With Clausewitzs dictum as a cautionary guide, Ukraine must not be satisfied with success in only urban battles, because the possession of towns, while a hostile army remains in the field, is not a receipt for strategic success. Ukraine is therefore duty bound to forcefully remove all of Russias forces, to include the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics and Armies, from its territory. For failing to do so, will result in continued hostility within Ukraines territorial borders.\n\nPrinciples of Urban Warfare\n\nReflecting on the Russo-Ukrainian Wars urban operations, the observer can identify an innumerable list of findings and associated recommendations. Attentive synthesis of those findings, however, reveals a set of transcendent principles of urban warfare that extend across urban operations, regardless of the conflict, which are innumerate below. Exhaustion, or the inability of an actor to maintain tactical, operational, or strategic progress toward its corresponding political or military objective, is the theme that unifies these principles.\n\nPrinciple 1: Urban operations are inseparable from attrition . Urban terrain undercuts the advantage of standoff warfare and the ability to maximize distance between two combatants. Forces required to fight in urban environments must therefore be built for the rigors and destruction of urban environments. Further, Western militaries must begin the uncomfortable move of distancing themselves from fanciful maneuver-centric doctrine and accept destruction-based, and positional, warfighting norms within their respective lexicon. Western nations must also examine their industrial base, and its linkage with the warfighting requirements of forces in attritional wars and modify the network to not quickly bankrupt war stocks once fighting commences.\n\nPrinciple 2: Polarity . Borrowing again from Clausewitz, it is important to that, \"In a battle each side aims at victory; that is a case of true polarity, since the victory of one side excludes the victory of the other.\"[55] As a result of polarity, Western military thinking must accept that advantages in urban battle are fleeting, because adversaries will find ways to offset strength and equipment asymmetry, just as Ukraine has done by weaponizing social media. Ukraines use of social media, from the outset of the invasion, is a case study in how information operations can assist in garnering support, and growing ones base of power, in the face of odds that upon initial look are insurmountable.\n\nPrinciple 3: Ground Lines of Communication (Still) Matter . As Ukraines urban battles attest, ground lines of communication still matter. Ukraines southern seaboard, for example, is an amalgamation of cities linked by a dense network of highways and railways. For an army like that of Russia, which relies on bulk supply distribution via rail, and micro-distribution to forward fighting locations with trucks, the rail and highway systems, and their major points of convergence, are critically important. As a result, when forecasting potential points of combat, Western militaries must assess the combatants logistics distribution system. If a combatant uses a bulk distribution system based on land movement, expect combat in and around areas in which railways and highways converge and diverge. If a combatant uses palletized distribution, expect combat to focus heavily around airports. In both instances, modern industrial warfare is dependent on the logistics network, and logistics hubs almost always reside in urban areas.\n\nPrinciple 4: Proximity and Density . The degree of civilian casualties and collateral damage corresponds to proximity, and density, of civilians and civilian infrastructure on a battlefield. Therefore, if engagements, battles, or campaigns are being fought in urban areas, then the civilian casualties, displaced persons, and collateral damage will be higher than if fought elsewhere. This principle applies regardless of the tactics or munitions ( i.e., ballistic or precision) used on the battlefield.\n\nPrinciple 5: Precision Paradox. In urban warfare, the precision paradox ensures that despite the use of precision munitions, battles will result in wide-scale destruction of civilian infrastructure and the loss of life.[56] Additionally, in urban warfare, which is dominated by a never-ending number of hiding places for an absconding combatant, the use of munitions will remain high.[57] As a result, Western militaries must discontinue the practice of thinking and speaking of precision munitions as a panacea, and as a tool that makes war less horrendous. Instead, they must account for the suboptimal effects that inevitably accompany the use of precision weaponry.\n\nPrinciple 6: Sieges . The siege of Mariupol, and specifically, the Azovstal industrial plant, highlight the recurrent character of sieges in modern urban warfare. In Ukraines ongoing war with Russia, which bore witness to significant sieges at Ilovaisk, Luhansk Airport, Donetsk Airport, and Debaltseve in 20142015.[58] Due to urban environments security from observation and fire strikes, as well as their connection to needed logistics infrastructure, such as railways, highways, and airports, urban sieges will remain a fixture in industrial, wars of attrition.[59] In light of this fact, Western militaries must develop doctrine, organization, and training solutions to account for the sieges absence in their collective thinking.\n\nPrinciple 7: Mobility . Remaining mobile in urban warfare is paramount for both survival and offensive action. Mobility allows a combatant to remain elusive and hard to kill. Simultaneously, mobility allows an actor to maintain the ability to move, strike, and defend on the move, which forces the other combatant to have to account for more variables than it would against a static, or fixed, enemy. Taking polarity into consideration, offensive and defensive action in urban areas must seek to deny an adversarys mobility by eliminating the adversarys vehicle fleets, and fuel and petroleum stores. Denying an enemy movement in an urban area makes it exponentially easier to fix the combatant in place, encircle the combatant, and concentrically eliminate the combatant from the battlefield.\n\nPrinciple 8: Base(s) of Power . To succeed in urban battles, especially in siege or encirclement situations, a combatant must possess a base, or multiple bases, of power. Accounting for polarity in warfare, strong initial conditions only get a combatant so far. Combatants must activate latent bases of power, and mobilize external bases of power, to maintain pace urban battles of attrition and position. As Ukraine demonstrates, the ability to mobilize external bases of powersuch as garnering support from the US, the EU, and NATO members, for instancehas allowed it to overcome correlation of forces and means comparisons that indicated that without support, Ukraines forces and weapons stockpiles were not long for the world.\n\nPrinciple 9: Center of Gravity (COGs) do not exist . As the loss of Russian General Officers and the destruction of field armies demonstrates, modern wars against actors with strategic depth in resources, viable ground lines of communication illustrate, and robust force structure, COGs are an antiquated relic of Napoleon interpretations of war and warfare. COGs reflect a mechanistic character of warfare in which heads of state led their armies on the field of battle, thereby creating a tight coupling between the policymaker and the tactical command of forces.[60] Further, COGs made sense when armies, industrial bases, and sustainment networks were less productive, less connected, and not able to rapidly communicate between one another. In this mechanistic model, eliminating an enemy army from the field of battle had a direct psychological impact on the head of state. Todays militaries, however, are not prone to shock and destruction like the armies of yore. Todays militaries consist of redundant communication and sustainment networks that generally account for losses in ways that negate the continued utility of COG thinking.[61] Therefore, Western militaries must discontinue the practice of placing a premium on COG analysis, and instead focus that attention on systems and network-centric thinking.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Russo-Ukraine Wars urban battles provide a wide array of insights into modern war. In many cases, the wars urban battles do not offer insight into new high-tech warfighting, but instead, reinforces many long-understood principles of warfare. Destruction and attrition, for instance, are not bygone ideas from wars of the past. Destruction and attritionto include siegesare a defining feature of modern war, which is clearly reflected by the interactions between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nWestern militaries must not shun doctrine, training, and organizations built for wars of attrition, but they must instead embrace this reality of war. Similarly, it is high time for Western militaries to begin to take urban warfare seriously and develop comprehensive doctrines, training, and organizations to thrive on urban battlefields. The principles of urban warfare outlined in this paper provide a point to start the discussion and move towards a better appreciation of urban warfare provided by the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nEndnotes\n\nThe views presented in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, or any other agency within the US Government.\n\n[1] Franz-Stefan Gady, \"Manoeuvre Versus Attrition in US Military Operations.\" Survival.

                "cc_text": "Anatoly, a 37-year-old soldier from the central Russian region of Bashkortostan, signed up for the war against Ukraine in June and was sent into combat three months later.\n\nHis unit spent 2 1/2 weeks on the front lines, he says. It didn't go well.\n\n\"All that time, we had no regular rations,\" he told RFE/RL. \"There was no ammunition, and we had to search for cartridges in the surrounding forest. We were promised new equipment and weaponry, but we were issued automatic rifles that had already been serviced three times. Some had crooked muzzles; others jammed at the second shot. We didn't have any heavy weaponry at all.\"\n\nA couple weeks after being thrown into battle, Anatoly and dozens of other contract soldiers from a regional unit called the Shaimuratov Battalion renounced their contracts and requested to be sent home.\n\nAnatoly's story is emblematic of the logistics and morale problems that Russia has faced as it grapples with major losses in the Ukraine war, a conflict that has lasted far longer than Moscow anticipated.\n\nExact figures are unknown, but some Western intelligence put the number of Russians killed and wounded as high as 80,000.\n\nTo replace the losses, Russia has turned to measures such as recruiting new volunteers with cash incentives, enlisting prisoners, or offering citizenship incentives to foreign mercenaries. On September 21, President Vladimir Putin announced a mobilization of military reserves aimed at bringing in at least 300,000 additional fighters.\n\nThe manpower problems have been exacerbated by the significant number of volunteer \"contract\" soldiers who have broken their contracts and refused further service. At the time he ordered mobilization, Putin also announced a provision automatically extending the contracts of volunteer soldiers and making it more difficult for them to refuse to fight.\n\nThe exact number of volunteers who've broken their contracts is unknown, but hundreds of cases have been documented. Ruslan Leviyev, the founder of the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian NGO that monitors open-source information about the military, told Current Time that \"the phenomenon of refusal is becoming systemic.\"\n\n\"According to our estimates, from 20 to 40 percent of the contract servicemen who returned from Ukraine and who are being readied to be sent back are refusing to return to combat,\" he said in April.\n\nMedia reports, open-source intelligence, and Ukrainian officials suggest the problem has only gotten worse.\n\n'I Didn't Think I'd Survive'\n\nBashkortostan's Shaimuratov Battalion was one of many regional volunteer units created during the summer as a way for Russia to cope with a shortage of troops. It was created in late May with the goal of signing up 800 soldiers.\n\nVolunteers were promised an initial payment of 200,000 rubles ($3,300) for signing up and 2,000 rubles ($33) per day of service -- wages that are above national averages and well above the average for Bashkortostan, which is a relatively impoverished region despite having substantial oil reserves.\n\nAnatoly -- who spoke to RFE/RL on condition that his identity be withheld -- said he signed up to fight in Ukraine because he thought: \"I could be useful there.\" \"And the money issue played a role. I thought I would pay off my debts and make a little something for my family,\" he said.\n\nAnatoly, who spoke by phone and social-media messages after his return to Bashkortostan, said 42 of his fellow soldiers submitted their written refusals on September 17 after weeks of being pounded by Ukrainian artillery and drones.\n\n\"Their artillery was so accurate that they would shell our trenches meter by meter,\" Anatoly said, although he added that he didn't experience any direct fighting with Ukrainian infantry. \"We had 10 rows of trenches, and they would hit each one in order.\"\n\n\"And what was the response from our side?\" he said. \"We called in for counterstrikes, but there was no answer.... And it was like that from the first day we arrived at our position.\"\n\nThe day after the soldiers submitted their written refusals to continue fighting, a political officer -- a Soviet-era practice involving an officer charged with monitoring troops' political leanings -- came to talk to the group, Anatoly says. Then they were loaded into two trucks and driven to a nearby city. \"They were looking for a children's camp...but couldn't find it in the dark,\" he said. \"We had to spend the night in the forest.\"\n\nThe next day they found the camp, and the men were held there for two days, Anatoly says. On September 20, they were transported to the Kherson region and put into an animal stable.\n\nThe following day -- September 21, the day that Putin signed the mobilization decree -- they were told they would be taken to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula region that Moscow annexed in 2014, in small groups since \"they won't let 40 men across the border at once.\"\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nBut after the first group had travelled just a few kilometers, the truck suddenly turned around and returned to the stable. Anatoly says there appeared to be bureaucratic confusion over how they submitted their refusals.\n\nMore officers arrived on September 23, Anatoly says, and tried to compel the soldiers to file new paperwork with that date; apparently to match the new regulations.\n\nAfter a heated confrontation during which the officers purportedly \"started calling us names and yelling,\" the men were loaded into a truck and taken to another location, where the regional military command was located.\n\nThe men, he said, were locked in a 25-square-meter garage with \"detained drunken servicemen and curfew violators.\" Anatoly says he was put in solitary confinement in a shipping container for 2 1/2 days in a T-shirt and slippers.\n\nThe soldiers managed to shoot a video appeal and send it to the head of Bashkortostan and his aide in charge of mobilization, Alik Kamaletdinov. They later posted a second video to social media.\n\nKamaletdinov declined to comment when contacted by RFE/RL.\n\n500 Kilograms Of Honey\n\nOfficers punished the soldiers by restricting access to toilets and cutting back food and water, Anatoly says.\n\nOn October 1, he said, a man claiming to be from Kamaletdinov's staff appeared and presented the unit with 500 kilograms of honey as \"humanitarian aid,\" which the soldiers scoffed at.\n\nA day later, Kamaletdinov himself came, apparently traveling all the way from Ufa, the capital of Bashkortostan. By then, Anatoly says, 30 soldiers had agreed to return to the front; 13 were left in the garage. \"He offered to send us to different units [in Ukraine], but we all refused,\" Anatoly said.\n\nTwo weeks later, he returned. \"He called us dogs and said that we would be considered traitors at home. He said we'd 'be abandoned' and that our relatives would have 'no life',\" Anatoly told RFE/RL. \"Then he left and we didn't see him again.\"\n\nFree To Leave\n\nAnatoly says he was held in the garage until October 9, when he and the others were then sent to a nearby smelter and held for another nine days. On October 18, an officer gave them their documents, and said they were free to leave.\n\nThe men then made their way to Crimea, some by bus and some by hitchhiking. Anatoly says he and four others arrived back in Ufa on October 22. He says he doesn't know what happened to the other soldiers who stayed to fight.\n\nOn October 28, Anatoly's enlistment contract officially expired. He says he is afraid to go to his recruitment office to finalize the agreement, for fear they will detain him and send him to prison or worse -- back to Ukraine.\n\nIn the end, he says, he was never given the 200,000-ruble signing bonus or most of the daily payments he was entitled to. Instead, he was paid just 34,000 rubles in total.\n\n\"It turns out I spent all those days in Ukraine for free,\" he said.\n\nWritten by Robert Coalson based on reporting by RFE/RL's Idel.Realities",

                "cc_text": "On October 22, Yelena Mikhailova and her longtime partner, Maksim, were married at the civil records office (ZAGS) in Pytalovo, a town in the Pskov region on Russia's border with Latvia. The hastily arranged wedding came just days after Maksim was called up to fight in Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine in a mobilization decreed by President Vladimir Putin on September 21.\n\n\"I never thought everything would happen so quickly,\" Mikhailova said. \"We weren't prepared for a wedding, but events pushed us to get married.... We didn't exchange rings because we didn't have the money to buy them. We decided we'd get them later when he comes back and, hopefully, they pay him at least some of the money he's been promised.\"\n\n\"We don't have much income,\" she continued. \"Maksim doesn't really have work but he gets by on odd jobs. Lately he's been working as a mechanic. Now the main thing is to gather the things my husband needs. I bought him some warm socks and clothes so that he'd have them when they send him over there.\"\n\nMikhailova's story is far from unique. Since Putin announced the mobilization less than six weeks ago, virtually every region across the country has seen a spike in marriages. In most regions, mobilized soldiers are allowed to marry the same day that they submit their paperwork with their partners. Some regions have arranged buses to get soldiers and their fiancees from mustering bases to the nearest marriage registration office, while others have arranged temporary wedding halls at the bases themselves.\n\nMikhailova's reason for getting married to Maksim, with whom she has lived for 19 years and raised two children, is also typical. \"Mobilization is a bit frightening,\" she told RFE/RL's North.Realities. \"Anything could happen to him. In any case, legally married wives have more rights, so we decided to formalize our relationship.\"\n\n'We Are Marrying Them In Bunches'\n\nWives are entitled to a payment up to 7 million rubles ($115,000) if their husband is killed or up to 3 million rubles if he is wounded in combat. The state also pays for transportation and accommodation for spouses to visit wounded men in the hospital. And onetime payments for the families of mobilized soldiers range from 50,000 to 150,000 rubles ($815 to $2,450), depending on the region.\n\nThe deputy head of the Pytalovo district in charge of mobilization, who asked not to be identified to protect his relatives near the combat zone, says the number of weddings of mobilized soldiers in his district has skyrocketed. \"We are marrying them in bunches, several couples at a time,\" he said. He mentions as well that mobilized soldiers are forming lines at the offices of notaries to file wills before being shipped out.\n\nThe independent Russian-focused outlet Mediazona conducted a study of the national marriage spike. Using data gathered from regional civil records offices, it estimated that at least 492,000 men had been mobilized since September 21. In Buryatia, an impoverished region in southern Siberia that had already contributed a disproportionate number of soldiers to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine even before mobilization, the number of weddings rose from 83 per week before mobilization was announced to 662 per week after.\n\nIn all, the 75 regions that reported marriage data to Mediazona carried out 31,000 weddings of mobilized soldiers in the four weeks after Putin's September 21 announcement. Local media in Astrakhan reported that a record 104 couples were married just on October 22. The town of Kamen-on-Ob in Siberia's Altai region reported 71 marriages between September 21 and October 15, compared to 23 during the same period last year.\n\nThe Zabaikalye region, in eastern Siberia, reported a record number of weddings in September and October. \"Workers at the regional records office conducted accelerated procedures on the same day as a mobilization notification was presented 1,211 times,\" the local administration newspaper reported.\n\nAnton Pinezhaninov is a native of Kotlas, a town in the northern Arkhangelsk region. He was mobilized and sent to a base in the Leningrad region so quickly that he didn't have time to marry his longtime partner, Maria, with whom he has two sons.\n\nMaria, however, traveled to Pinezhaninov's base to conclude the wedding at a ZAGS in St. Petersburg after St. Petersburg Governor Aleksandr Beglov ordered officials to expedite the weddings of mobilized soldiers.\n\nLarisa Solovyova, whose son was also quickly mobilized from Kotlas, told RFE/RL he had been turned away by the local ZAGS, where officials insisted on enforcing a one-month waiting period. \"Is my son heading off to summer camp?\" she said. \"He's going off to war. But the bureaucrats refuse to work under wartime conditions.... I won't give my son's name -- the enemy doesn't need to know. I am really worried about him.\"\n\nKemerovo region Governor Sergei Tsivilyov on October 13 organized and presided over the weddings of seven mobilized soldiers in the Siberian city of Omsk, wearing a large Latin letter Z on his label, the Kremlin's symbol of support for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'Just For All This To Be Over'\n\nIn September, 34 couples were married in the town of Kostomuksha in the northwestern Karelia region. One of them was Anna Vasilyeva and her mobilized husband, Aleksei. \"When mobilization was announced, I still wasn't sure that I loved him,\" Vasilyeva told RFE/RL. \"We were just dating and getting to know each other. But when his notification came, we were both struck suddenly, and we understood that we loved one another.\"\n\n\"I went to his base in Tver,\" she continued. \"They gave him leave from his unit and we went to the central ZAGS, showed them his notice, and were married. The line was very long, and we stood for a long time. It was stuffy and uncomfortable.\"\n\nAfter the wedding, over beer and sausages, Vasilyeva says she tried to persuade her husband not to go to war. \"I told him to go to Georgia or to hide somewhere like other men from Karelia had done,\" she said. \"But he refused. He and I have very different views on life and what is going on. His unit has been seriously 'brainwashed' by experienced instructors from the Vagner [private military] company.\"\n\n\"When we parted, I told him to remain human no matter what happens,\" she added. \"Not to torture anyone if a Ukrainian surrenders to him. I sent him off, but I don't believe he will come back, although I tell him all the time on the phone that I am waiting for him and he must come home. But I am not confident he will remain the same good, sweet boy that I have known so long.\"\n\nBack in Pytalovo, near the Latvian border, Yelena Mikhailova is alone with her two sons. \"Who is going to feed us?\" she asked. \"He is gone. We have two sons -- who is going to raise them? And I'm also afraid for our eldest, who is 17. I didn't need a wedding. I don't need anything. Just for all this to be over.\"\n\n\"We want to live like we lived before,\" she said.\n\nWritten by Robert Coalson based on reporting by RFE/RL's North.Realities",

All times EDT.\n\n10:08 p.m.: Bulgaria's parliament Thursday agreed to send military aid to Ukraine, after a previous decision to refrain from directly supplying arms to the war-torn country following Russia's invasion, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nBulgaria, once a signatory to a defense pact with the USSR, still flies a small number of Soviet-built MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has been asking for because its pilots know how to fly them.\n\nThe Balkan country also has S-300 long-range surface-to-air missiles, but Defense Minister Dimitar Stoyanov earlier this week said his country could not afford to part with them.\n\nBulgaria is a member of NATO and the European Union, but still has close historical, cultural and economic ties with Moscow.\n\n9:15 p.m.: Ten million metric tons of grains and foodstuffs have left Ukraine in the past three months, the U.N. chief said Thursday, calling for the renewal of a deal vital to \"reducing the risk of hunger\" worldwide, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe landmark announcement comes just days after the so-called Black Sea grain deal was called into question by Moscow's complaints over sanctions. The deal was put in place over the summer to ease the global food crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"As of today, 10 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs have been shipped through the Black Sea corridor. It has taken just three months to reach this milestone,\" United Nation chief Antonio Guterres told journalists.\n\n8:49 p.m.: A senior U.N. official said on Thursday that the global body was prioritizing efforts to export stranded Russian fertilizers from European ports and hopes to make advances before a deadline for renewing the Black Sea grains deal this month, Reuters reported.\n\nMoscow on Wednesday resumed its participation in a U.N.-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative after a four-day suspension, easing pressure on food prices and allaying fears of a renewed global food crisis.\n\nHowever, Russia has stopped short of giving its support for a renewal of the deal beyond its November 19 expiration and is urging the United Nations to help fulfill parts of the deal intended to ease Russia's food and fertilizer exports.\n\nThe U.N. World Food Program confirmed to Reuters that it stands ready to help ship an initial 20,000 metric tons of Russian fertilizer to Malawi.\n\n8:15 p.m.: The UK government said Thursday it would ban ships and services used to transport Russian crude oil above the price cap set by the G-7 and Australia, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThis comes after a EU ban on insuring ships transporting Russian crude and as G-7 ministers have agreed on setting a price cap on Russian oil, aimed at crimping the Kremlin's revenues and containing soaring energy prices.\n\nAustralia and the European Union have backed the price cap.\n\nThe Treasury said that legislation taking effect on December 5 \"introduces a ban on UK ships and services facilitating the maritime transport of Russian crude oil.\" It said this would apply unless oil was \"purchased at or below the Oil Price Cap set by the Price Cap Coalition of the G-7 and Australia.\"\n\n7:40 p.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday ordered a one-time payment of 195,000 rubles ($3,200) for contract soldiers and those who have been mobilized to fight in Ukraine, the Kremlin said, according to Reuters.\n\nLast week Moscow said the \"partial mobilization\" of 300,000 reservists was over but conceded there had been problems. More than 2,000 people were arrested at protests amid public outcry over cases of men being called up despite medical exemptions, or a lack of military experience.\n\nIn a decree published on the Kremlin website, Putin said the payment was designed \"to provide additional measures of social support\" to contract soldiers and those who had been called up. It did not give further details.\n\nThe minimum monthly wage on offer for contract soldiers is 160,000 rubles ($2,700), which is almost three times the national average.\n\n6:42 p.m.: More than 100 men mobilized to the war in Ukraine from Russia's Chuvashia region have rebelled, demanding overdue salaries promised to them, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nThe group issued a video statement recorded on November 2 by the men in the military training center in the city of Ulyanovsk in which they say they \"will fight for justice\" until their overdue salaries are fully paid.\n\n5:55 p.m.: Moldova has imported natural gas from Slovakia, for the first time obtaining volumes pumped from west to east, a senior member of the government said on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe comments by Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu demonstrated Moldova's ability to source gas from places other than Russia as it faces growing supply problems.\n\nThe small ex-Soviet state is reliant on Russian natural gas supplied by Gazprom and is grappling with a 40% cut in Russian deliveries that has hurt its ability to supply enough electricity to its 2.5 million population.\n\nSpinu said Moldovan company Energocom had bought 5 million cubic meters of gas in Slovakia and lauded it as a step towards greater energy independence.\n\n5 p.m.: Like much of Ukraines northern Kharkiv region, Vovchansk was occupied by Russian forces in the early hours of Moscows invasion on February 24. It was liberated in September during a lightning Ukrainian counteroffensive that sent Russian forces reeling out of the region, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reports.\n\n4:33 p.m.: Ukrainian forces can retake the strategic southern city of Kherson from Russian troops, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday, in what would be a major defeat for Russia in its invasion of its neighbor, Reuters reported.\n\nAustin's remarks coincided with a Russian-installed official in Kherson region saying Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnieper River, signaling a significant retreat, if confirmed.\n\nUkraine said it was still fighting in the area and was wary of the occupying Russian forces setting a trap.\n\nAustin did not answer a question about whether Russian forces were preparing to leave. But, in perhaps his most optimistic comments yet on the Ukrainian counter-offensive, expressed confidence in their ability to beat back Russian forces.\n\n3:56 p.m.: Officials from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow met with Brittney Griner on Thursday, officials said, according to Reuters, in the first visit in months for the WNBA star who is jailed in Russia and could soon be transferred to a penal colony.\n\n\"We are told she is doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One as President Joe Biden flew to New Mexico.\n\nThe visit was the first consular access to Griner since early August, when the two-time Olympic gold medalist was found guilty of narcotics possession and smuggling for bringing cannabis-infused vape cartridges into Russia. A court last week rejected an appeal of her nine-year prison sentence.\n\nWashington and Moscow have discussed swapping Griner and fellow detainee Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, for a Russian arms dealer jailed in the United States, but no deal has materialized amid heightened tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n3:01 p.m.: The G-7 will not allow Russia to inflict \"starvation\" on Ukrainians this winter as a result of its assault on the country, Germany said Thursday ahead of a key meeting of the group of wealthy nations, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nAffirming support for Ukraine is expected to be the number one topic on the agenda at the two-day meeting of G-7 foreign ministers in the western city of Muenster.\n\nWestern allies will provide generators, heaters, container housing, tents, beds and blankets as some of the items that will be part of a \"winter aid package\" for Ukraine, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba addressed the conference via a video link on Thursday.\n\n2:33 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday his country would not participate in the upcoming G-20 summit in Indonesia if Russian President Vladimir Putin also attends, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"If the leader of the Russian Federation was to take part in it, Ukraine would not be participating,\" Zelenskyy told a press conference with Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou in Kyiv.\n\nPutin is yet to say if he will attend.\n\n1 p.m.: The U.N. nuclear agency said its inspectors investigating Russian claims that Ukraine is preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\" have not found any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the three sites they have inspected.\n\nUkraine has strongly denied Moscow's allegations that it is planning to detonate a dirty bomb on its own territory and in turn accused Russia of plotting to use the threat of a bomb laced with nuclear material as a pretext for an escalation in Ukraine.\n\nRussia raised the matter at the U.N. Security Council last week and warned in a letter that it \"will regard the use of the dirty bomb by the Kyiv regime as an act of nuclear terrorism.\"\n\nUkraine invited the IAEA inspectors. The IAEA said they visited the locations where Russia made allegations about activities: the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv, Eastern Mining and Processing Plant in Zhovti Kody, and Production Association Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant in Dnipro.\n\nThe agency said its inspectors were given \"unfettered access to the locations.\"\n\n12:35 p.m.: The International Atomic Energy Agency says the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine lost all access to external electricity following overnight shelling and is currently receiving backup power from its emergency diesel generators.\n\nNuclear operator Energoatom blamed Russia for shelling in the area that damaged power lines and electrical substations. Russia put the blame on Ukraine.\n\nThe IAEA said in a statement that senior Ukrainian operating staff informed their experts of indications that the power lines were physically damaged \"at two different locations about 50-60 kilometers from the plant itself, in Ukrainian-controlled territory.\" Repair work was under way at one of the locations.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the development is \"extremely concerning\" and \"again demonstrates the plants fragile and vulnerable situation.\" He has been working with both sides to establish a demilitarized protection zone around the nuclear plant.\n\n\"Measures are needed to prevent a nuclear accident at the site. The establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone is urgently needed,\" he said\n\n11:51 a.m.: Russia and Ukraine on Thursday exchanged 214 captured service personnel in the latest of a series of prisoner swaps, many of the Ukrainians wounded survivors of a failed attempt to defend the city of Mariupol in April and May, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that Ukraine had released 107 Russian personnel, and that they would be transferred to Moscow for \"the necessary medical and psychological assistance.\"\n\nAndriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said Russia had released 107 Ukrainian fighters, including 74 who had defended the Azovstal steel works, scene of Ukraine's last stand in Mariupol.\n\n10 a.m.: Ukraine is counting on more Western technological support as its war against Russia drags on, with Microsoft pledging Thursday to extend its backing for Kyiv's \"extraordinary\" wartime innovation through the end of next year, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMicrosoft's financial commitment of more than $400 million enables the Ukraine government and other organizations to continue using the Microsoft cloud and its public data centers across Europe, the companys president, Brad Smith, announced at the annual Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nCloud technology offers resilience and security for Ukraine operations, Smith said, after Russia targeted Ukrainian data centers with air strikes when it invaded more than eight months ago.\n\nThe invasion triggered \"extraordinary innovation\" by the Ukrainian military, Smith said.\n\n8:36 a.m.: As Russians seized parts of eastern and southern Ukraine in the opening stages of the war, mayors, civilian administrators and others, including nuclear power plant workers, say they have been abducted, threatened or beaten to force their cooperation. In some instances, they have been killed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHuman rights activists say these actions could constitute a war crime. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov said he was abducted from his office and \"the bullying and threats did not stop for a minute. They tried to force me to continue leading the city under the Russian flag, but I refused.\"\n\nAfter six days in detention and an intervention from Ukraine's president, he was exchanged for nine Russian prisoners of war and expelled from the occupied city\n\n7:30 a.m.: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Moscow had called on the United Nations to help fulfill part of the Black Sea grain deal that would ease Russias own food exports.\n\nLavrov was speaking at a news conference in Jordan, one day after Russia said it would resume its participation in the initiative, u-turning on its decision, taken last weekend, to suspend its role in the deal.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of the energy system, Ukraine's grid operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday.\n\nThe regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are both Ukrainian steelmaking hubs. Russian strikes have damaged 40% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy has said, Reuters reported.\n\n6 a.m.: A senior Russian official said on Thursday that Russia had prevented a Ukrainian attack on the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.\n\nRepeated shelling of the plant has raised the possibility of a grave accident just 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, Reuters reported.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, which has repeatedly expressed concerns over the shelling of the plant, has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.\n\nUkraine says Russia has repeatedly shelled the plant while Russia says Ukraine has shelled the plant. Both sides deny the others claims.\n\nUkrainian forces \"continue to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with Western weapons which could lead to a global catastrophe,\" Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said.\n\nPatrushev said that Russian special services had prevented what he said was a \"terrorist attack\" on the plant.\n\nUkraines state nuclear company said on Thursday that Russian shelling had damaged high voltage lines at the plant.\n\nAfter invading Ukraine on February 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March. Special Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists are on site. Ukrainian staff continue to help operate the plant.\n\n5:30 a.m.: Hungarys parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland's and Sweden's applications to join NATO, Reuters reported Thursday, quoting Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto who was speaking at a press conference.\n\nSzijjarto said the government has done its job by submitting the relevant bill to parliament. Hungary and Turkey are the only members not to have ratified the applications.\n\n5 a.m.: Ukraine has made no new commitments that go beyond the terms of a deal signed in July to free up grain exports from its Black Sea ports following Russias invasion, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Thursday.\n\nSpokesman Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Facebook that Ukraine had never used the Black Sea grain \"corridor\" for military purposes and had never intended to do so.\n\n4:30 a.m.: Seven ships carrying agricultural products left Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Thursday, a day after the resumption of a grain deal aimed at delivering Ukrainian food to foreign markets, the infrastructure ministry said, Reuters reported.\n\nThe vessels were loaded with 290,000 tons of food products and were headed towards European and Asian countries, the ministry said in a statement without elaborating.\n\n4 a.m.: Disinformation and hatred against Jews has \"flourished\" online throughout Russia's invasion of Ukraine, further aggravating a trend set in motion during the COVID-19 pandemic, Agence France-Presse reported Thursday, citing an EU report.\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic and Russia's aggression against Ukraine further fueled\" anti-Semitism, which \"remains a serious problem in our societies,\" said Michael OFlaherty, director of the Vienna-based Fundamental Rights Agency, or the FRA.\n\nA working group meeting in June had already highlighted \"the risks of fake narratives\" and disinformation stoking up anti-Semitism, as Russia justified its war by misusing \"terms such as Nazi and genocide\" to describe the government in Ukraine.\n\nIn its annual report, which was compiled this July, the FRA said that \"Jewish communities across Europe\" have been \"profoundly affected\" by online hate and disinformation in the context of the Russian invasion and the outbreak.\n\nThe bloc's rights agency reiterated that \"recording of anti-Semitic incidents remains poor across Europe,\" with data collection and classification varying in each country. No official data on recorded anti-Semitic incidents was available from two EU member states, Hungary and Portugal, making it difficult to meaningfully compare the situation across the bloc\n\nIn some countries, such as Austria and Finland, \"most recorded incidents took place online.\" The European Commission presented its first ever strategy to combat anti-Semitism in October 2021.\n\nBrussels is expected to publish reports on the implementation of its strategy in 2024 and 2029 respectively, also relying on FRA data regarding anti-Semitic incidents for their assessment.\n\n3:35 a.m.: The British ambassador arrived at the Russian foreign ministry on Thursday morning, Reuters reported quoting the RIA Novosti news agency, after she was summoned to discuss Moscows claims that Britain was involved in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russias Black Sea Fleet in Crimea.\n\n3:15 a.m.:\n\n2:58 a.m.: Russias Gazprom said it would ship 42.4 million cubic meters of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Thursday, levels similar to those reported in recent days.\n\n2 a.m.: Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Reuters reported Thursday, quoting Ukraines nuclear firm Energoatom.\n\nThe power plant has 15 days worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. The plant's blocks 5 and 6 are being switched into cold state, it said.\n\n1:30 a.m.: Foreign ministers from the G-7 group of rich democracies will discuss how best to coordinate further support for Ukraine when they meet on Thursday in Germany following recent Russian attacks on energy infrastructure that have caused widespread power cuts, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to dominate the two-day meeting of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken with his G-7 counterparts in the western German city of Muenster, although Chinas increasingly assertive role in the world and protests in Iran will also be high on the agenda.\n\n\"This G-7 ministerial is, for us, coming at an important time,\" a senior State Department official said, noting that the group \"has been a vital coordinating mechanism\" for policy approaches on the most pressing issues.\n\nThe G-7 meeting, hosted by Germany, which holds the groups rotating presidency, will provide an opportunity for the worlds richest democracies to discuss recent developments in China and security in the Indo Pacific after Chinese President Xi Jinping consolidated his grip on power at a Communist Party Congress.\n\n12:30 a.m.:\n\n12:01 a.m.: The U.N. Security Council has overwhelmingly rejected Russias attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out \"military biological\" activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRussia only got support from China in the vote on its resolution, with the U.S., Britain and France voting \"no\" and the 10 other council nations abstaining.\n\nThe 2-3-10 vote reflected the councils continuing opposition to Russias actions since its February 24 invasion of Ukraine. Russias deputy ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said his government was \"extremely disappointed\" at the vote. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the resolution was \"based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith.\"\n\nVOAs United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer has been following developments.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

                "cc_text": "November 13, 3:30 pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nISW is publishing an abbreviated campaign update today, November 13. This report discusses the likely evolution of the war following Ukraines operational success in regaining control of western Kherson Oblast. The Russians are not setting conditions for a relaxation of hostilities for the rest of the fall and into the winter but rather are launching a new offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainians will likely use combat power recouped from the liberation of western Kherson to reinforce their ongoing counter-offensive in Luhansk Oblast or to open a new counter-offensive drive elsewhere. This is not the time to slow down aid or press for ceasefires or negotiations, but rather the time to help Ukraine take advantage of its momentum in conditions that favor Kyiv rather than Moscow.\n\nUkraine has won an important victory in the campaign that liberated western Kherson Oblast, culminating in the withdrawal of Russian forces completed on November 11.[1] Russian President Vladimir Putin had been determined to hold this key terrain, possession of which would have allowed him to renew his invasion of unoccupied Ukraine from positions on the west bank of the Dnipro River. That consideration was likely more important in Putins calculations than the symbolic value of retaining the only oblast capital his forces had seized since February 24, 2022. (Russia had already taken Luhansk City and Donetsk City in its 2014-2015 invasion.) Putin had committed substantial Russian forces to the defense of western Kherson, including many of the remaining elite airborne units available to the Russian military.[2] He also committed reinforcements generated by the partial mobilization of reservists he had ordered on September 21.[3] Those forces had dug in and fought hard to hold their ground, taking many losses. Ukraines success despite this Russian determination and allocation of scarce elite units is in many respects even more impressive than its victory in Kharkiv Oblast in mid-September.[4]\n\nUkraines success resulted in large part from the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAFs) innovative use of the US-provided HIMARS precision rocket system to disrupt Russian supply lines. The HIMARS munitions the US has given Ukraine are not suitable for destroying bridgestheir warheads are too small and are not optimized for such strikes. The UAF developed a tactic to work around that limitation by conducting multiple precision strikes across the key Antonivskiy Bridge and the road that ran atop the Kakhovka Dam in such a way as to break the roadways in a line across them, rendering them unusable without actually destroying the bridges infrastructure (or badly damaging the dam).[5] The UAF continued to strike the bridges as the Russians sought to repair them, targeting the repair equipment as well as the roadways until the Russians finally gave up. The Russians attempted to construct a pontoon bridge under the Antonivskiy Bridge as a mitigation, but the UAF attacked that effort as well, causing the Russians to abandon it.[6] The Russians were left at the end with barges ferrying supplies, equipment, and reinforcements from the east to the west bank.[7] The UAF attacked the barges and landing areas as well, but the ferry system was in any case insufficient to supply the 20,000-some Russian mechanized troops trying to hold their lodgment on the western bank of the river.[8]\n\nIt was clear that the Russians would be unable to defend that lodgment by the time Russian Army General Sergey Surovikin took command of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on October 8.[9] Surovikin signaled his intention to withdraw from western Kherson almost immediately and likely began setting conditions to retreat within a couple of weeks.[10] It is not clear whether Putin authorized Surovikin to abandon western Kherson fully at that time or whether Surovikin had to continue working to persuade Putin of the hopelessness of any effort to hold on in western Kherson. However that may be, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu met with Surovikin on November 9 in a staged, public setting and ordered him to withdraw, which Surovikin promptly did.[11]\n\nPutin likely elevated Surovikin and let him withdraw from western Kherson on condition that he take the rest of Donetsk Oblast using Russian forces recouped from western Kherson as well as newly-arriving mobilized servicemen.[12] This observation offered by Andriy Zagorodnyuk, chairman of the Ukrainian Center of Defense Strategies, is the likeliest explanation for the resumption in the intensity of Russian offensive operations first around Bakhmut and then to the southwest around the Vuhledar area that began on October 28.[13] These offensive efforts otherwise make little operational sense. They are far from operationally significant locations apart from Bakhmut and were launched during a difficult muddy time by inadequately prepared mobilized servicemen before Russian commanders in the area had amassed enough combat power for decisive operations.[14] Surovikin likely ordered them to start when they did as an earnest sign of his commitment to Putin.\n\nRussian offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast will intensify in the coming weeks as additional mobilized servicemen arrive along with forces withdrawn from western Kherson. Ukrainian forces in the area will find themselves hard-pressed, and Kyiv will very likely have to divert troops to defend against these renewed Russian offensives. The Russians are not likely to make operationally significant gains despite their renewed efforts, although they could conceivably take Bakhmut over time at enormous cost. Russian mobilized servicemen have shown themselves to be inadequately trained, poorly equipped, and very reluctant to fight.[15] They are not arriving in cohesive units but rather are being sent largely as individual or small unit replacements to units that have been fighting without rest for nine months, have suffered devastating losses in men and equipment, and are largely demoralized themselves.\n\nRussian forces operating in Donetsk Oblast include conventional units of the regular Russian Armed Forces, mobilized servicemen, Wagner Private Military Company troops, BARS (Russian volunteer reserve) formations, militia units from the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics, soldiers from Ramzan Kadyrovs Chechen units, and volunteer battalions.[16] This bizarre congeries of combat forces will have considerably less effective combat power than would a grouping of regular units of similar size. It is extremely unlikely that Surovikin will be able to forge it into a force able to conduct large-scale offensive mechanized maneuver warfare, particularly since he is not even taking (or being allowed to take) the time to build a coherent strike force before hurling it into the attack. This weird mix of forces will likely make some gains through sheer weight of numbers, but Ukrainian defenders, likely reinforced, will most probably force it to a halt over the next few months not far from its starting points.\n\nUkraine will also likely recoup combat power from western Kherson and redeploy it to other areas for both defensive and counter-offensive operations. The UAF could conceivably try to chase the Russians across the Dnipro River at various points but is unlikely to do so because the logistics of supporting a Ukrainian lodgment on the eastern bank are very daunting. The UAF is therefore more likely to consolidate its control of the western bank, leave enough force to deter any Russian attempt to cross the river again, and reallocate forces to other areas. The Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast will likely require the UAF to divert some forces to defend in that area, but the UAF will likely send at least part of the recouped combat power either to reinforce its ongoing counter-offensive in Luhansk Oblast or to open another counter-offensive somewhere else (we will not speculate about where that might be).\n\nUkrainian forces have continued to make limited gains in Luhansk Oblast and will likely be able to make more gains if they are reinforced by troops from western Kherson. The Russians are also reinforcing their defensive positions in Luhansk Oblast, to be sure, but the UAF has been grinding forward nevertheless, and there is no reason to forecast that the ill-trained, ill-equipped, and low-morale Russian reservists will be able to stop Ukrainian troops, buoyed by their victories, from advancing.\n\nA cessation or prolonged slowing of combat operations over the next few months is therefore very unlikely. The Russians are emphatically not attempting to establish and strengthen defensive positions all along the line but are rather renewing offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast.[17] The Ukrainians will almost certainly continue their counter-offensive operations already underway. Both sides are already fighting in very muddy conditions. They will not likely stop fighting when winter freezes the ground and makes it even more conducive to large-scale mechanized maneuver warfare. Combat is more likely to intensify than to slacken as temperatures drop.\n\nAny attempt at a ceasefire or cessation of hostilities at this time would overwhelmingly favor Russia. Putin should desire such a ceasefire in his own interest. He should recognize that he needs to give his forces time to recover and allow the reservists flowing into the theater time to integrate into their units, train up, and prepare for serious combat. He should want to stop the Ukrainians from capitalizing on the emotional lift of their recent victories. The fact that Putin continues to whip his generals to offensives in these circumstances is thus a grave error from a military perspective. It likely results from whatever psychological factors led Putin to order the invasion in the first place but also increasingly from Putins need to show his toughness to the hardline faction led, at least in public, by Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin. Putin is unlikely to be willing to seek a ceasefire, therefore, unless it is accompanied by tremendous Ukrainian or international concessions.\n\nNapoleon famously quipped: Never interrupt your enemy whilst he is in the midst of making a mistake. That aphorism has never been truerUkraine and its backers should take advantage of Putins error by continuing to press the counter-offensive in circumstances far more favorable to Kyiv than to Moscow.\n\nUkraine has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival even with the victory in western Kherson, finally. The city of Melitopol and surrounding areas, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, land on the east bank of the lower Dnipro River, and territory in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are all vital terrain for Ukraine, as ISW has previously argued.[18] Discussions about the future of Crimea and other Ukrainian lands illegally occupied by Russia after 2014 are premature. Ukraine must liberate tens of thousands of square kilometers short of those areas if it is to be able to defend itself against future Russian attacks and reestablish a functional economy.\n\nUkrainians and the West must bend every effort to enabling the liberation of those lands as rapidly as possible before worrying about what lies beyond them. Momentum is an important factor in war. Ukraine has it now. Kyiv and its partners must make the most of it.\n\nKey inflections in ongoing military operations on November 13:\n\nWagner Group Financer Yevgeny Prigozhin asked the Russian Prosecutor Generals Office to open a case against St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov for high treason amid viral footage of Wagner forces murdering one of their own.[19] Prigozhin and Russian nationalist milbloggers largely supported the murder of the alleged traitor.[20]\n\nThe Russian military grouping stationed in Belarus continues to generate social tensions among Belarusians.[21]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the direction of Kreminna and Svatove.[22]\n\nUkrainian forces continued to consolidate control over the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.[23] Ukrainian forces struck a Russian military base in Chaplynka, Kherson Oblast, 50km south of Beryslav on the eastern bank of the Dnipro.[24]\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct offensive operations in the directions of Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Vuhledar.[25] The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that Russian forces captured Mayorsk, southeast of Bakhmut.[26]\n\nRussian forces continued routine indirect fire against frontline settlements in Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.[27] Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia City with an Iskander missile.[28]\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the demobilization of mobilized students in Russian-occupied Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, likely as part of an ongoing effort to integrate proxy forces into the Russian Armed Forces.[29]\n\nRussian forces and occupation officials are forcibly mobilizing men in Russian-occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, and forcing them to construct trenches and defensive fortifications in the city.[30]\n\nUkrainian officials stated that Russian forces are withdrawing from the left bank of the Dnipro River and concentrating forces and equipment in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, and Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast.[31]\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin proposed an amendment to a draft law that would allow Russian officials to revoke Russian citizenship for disseminating \"false\" information about the Russian military, participating in extremist or undesirable organizations, or calling for violations of Russian \"territorial integrity.\"[32]\n\nView Citations",

                "cc_text": "Image At the International Military-Technical Forum in Moscow in August. Russia is the worlds second largest arms exporter after the United States. Credit... Nanna Heitmann for The New York Times\n\nArms sales have long been an important part of Russian foreign policy. But those sales were declining before the invasion of Ukraine, and analysts say that the war will probably hasten the trend.\n\nRussias performance on the battlefield has damaged its reputation as a military power, they say, and financial and export controls by the U.S. and European governments will make it that much harder for the Kremlin to present itself as a reliable long-term arms supplier for future deals.\n\n\"I dont think Russia can recover as a major arms exporter from this,\" said Ian Storey, a political scientist at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore who studies security issues in Asia. \"Not for a long time, if ever.\"\n\nRussia is still the worlds second-largest arms exporter after the United States, and its sales of air defense systems and combat aircraft to China and Egypt its second- and third-largest clients after India have risen substantially in recent years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, known as SIPRI.\n\nBut from 2017 to 2021, Russias share of the global arms export market declined by 5 percent, to 19 percent, compared with the previous four-year period, according to SIPRI data. Its exports also fell by about a quarter, primarily because of decreasing demand from India and Vietnam.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine grinds on and sanctions against Russia increase, doubts are growing about the quality of Russian weapons, as well as Moscows capacity to produce advanced weapons and provide long-term support for clients who buy them, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms researcher at SIPRI.\n\n\"Russia just doesnt have the technology base or the economy to support development of many types of new weapons and components,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts say that Southeast Asia, where Russia has traditionally been the top arms supplier, is a useful case study in the Kremlins declining prospects as an arms exporter.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2021, South Korea eclipsed Russia as the regions top arms supplier, providing 18 percent of the regions arms imports, according to SIPRI data. No other exporter accounted for more than 14 percent.\n\nDuring that period, South Korea sent warships to the Philippines and Thailand, submarines to Indonesia, and combat and trainer aircraft to the Philippines and Thailand. Russia also lost a few potential deals. Indonesia canceled an order for 11 Russian fighter jets last year, buying American and French planes instead.\n\nFor many Southeast Asian nations, the United States is an increasingly attractive arms supplier because it links weapons purchases with military or diplomatic support against China, Mr. Wezeman said. Several European arms suppliers have been willing to help countries in the region develop their own arms industries and capabilities, in some cases through technology transfers, he added.\n\nAnother reason to avoid purchasing Russian arms is to signal a neutral position on the invasion of Ukraine, said John Parachini, a senior defense researcher at the RAND Corporation.\n\n\"Despite a likely aggressive Russian effort to market its arms exports in the Southeast Asia, they will find fewer customers,\" he said.\n\nOne exception might be Myanmar, where the ruling military junta, saddled with U.S. sanctions that limit its weapons purchases, has signaled a willingness to sign more arms deals with Russia. However, there are questions about whether the Kremlin would have the supplies to manufacture them.\n\nAnother could be Vietnam, Russias largest arms client in Southeast Asia. Because that countrys military arsenal has been built around Soviet and Russian weaponry for decades, adding weapons from new suppliers could create compatibility issues, said Ridzwan Rahmat, the principal defense analyst at Janes, based in Singapore.\n\nAt the same time, he added, Vietnam appears to be \"slowly shifting its orbit from Russian systems to a mix that includes NATO-compliant ones, although this will take decades.\"\n\nEven before the war, Vietnam was trying to diversify its arsenal by manufacturing its own guns and troop carriers and buying small amounts of weapons from India and Israel. The war in Ukraine will likely accelerate that process, and it could even spur Vietnam to buy Western-made weapons on a much faster timeline than it had planned, said Nguyen The Phuong, a scholar of Vietnams military at the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\n\"If we want to maintain some kind of deterrence capability toward China, the modernization has to speed up like 10 times faster,\" he said.",

The US has given the most, but its stocks are the largest, too. The Czech Republic is Ukraines most loyal ally in terms of the proportion of items given. While initially hesitating, Germanys role is greater and greater. But some well-armed NATO countries are not in a hurry to supply anything.\n\nUkrainian analyst Volodymyr Dacenko has shared his analysis of what countries have transferred the most heavy weapons to Ukraine as it fights against the Russian invasion on Twitter.\n\nNATO transferred 1.4-3.6% of its heavy weapons systems to Ukraine. The highest percentage is for artillery about 3.6%. The need for artillery remains the most acute because Ukraine has minimal stocks of shells for Soviet artillery systems of 122/152mm caliber. The transition to NATO artillery began in April. And in half a year, Ukraine received about 400 artillery systems of 105/155mm caliber. The US transferred the most systems about 200 units. But this country also has the largest reserves of artillery among NATO countries.\n\nNATO countries transferred about 1.4% of their armored vehicles to Ukraine. Here, too, the largest supplier is the USA more than 1,140 units. But in relation to its stockpile of weapons, this is 0.8% of all armoured vehicles that the United States has.\n\nHowever, among NATO members, not all countries are in a hurry to transfer heavy weapons. For example, the most armed NATO countries include Trkiye, Greece, and Romania.\"\n\nNew developments\n\nRussia rejects G20 focus on security, Reuters reports. \"In a statement issued ahead of the summit, Russias foreign ministry said it was \"fundamentally important that the G20 concentrate its efforts on real, rather than imaginary, threats.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had been determined to hold this key terrain, possession of which would have allowed him to renew his invasion of unoccupied Ukraine from positions on the west bank of the Dnipro River. That consideration was likely more important in Putins calculations than the symbolic value of retaining the only oblast capital his forces had seized since February 24, 2022. (Russia had already taken Luhansk City and Donetsk City in its 2014-2015 invasion.) Putin had committed substantial Russian forces to the defense of western Kherson, including many of the remaining elite airborne units available to the Russian military. He also committed reinforcements generated by the partial mobilization of reservists he had ordered on September 21. Those forces had dug in and fought hard to hold their ground, taking many losses. Ukraines success despite this Russian determination and allocation of scarce elite units is in many respects even more impressive than its victory in Kharkiv Oblast in mid-September. Russias campaign to Russify Ukrainians in Kherson failed NYT Russian President Vladimir Putin had been determined to hold this key terrain, possession of which would have allowed him to renew his invasion of unoccupied Ukraine from positions on the west bank of the Dnipro River. That consideration was likely more important in Putins calculations than the symbolic value of retaining the only oblast capital his forces had seized since February 24, 2022.

Ukraines success despite this Russian determination and allocation of scarce elite units is in many respects even more impressive than its victory in Kharkiv Oblast in mid-September. Ukraines success resulted in large part from the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAFs) innovative use of the US-provided HIMARS precision rocket system to disrupt Russian supply lines. The HIMARS munitions the US has given Ukraine are not suitable for destroying bridgestheir warheads are too small and are not optimized for such strikes. The UAF developed a tactic to work around that limitation by conducting multiple precision strikes across the key Antonivskiy Bridge and the road that ran atop the Kakhovka Dam in such a way as to break the roadways in a line across them, rendering them unusable without actually destroying the bridges infrastructure (or badly damaging the dam). The UAF continued to strike the bridges as the Russians sought to repair them, targeting the repair equipment as well as the roadways until the Russians finally gave up. The Russians attempted to construct a pontoon bridge under the Antonivskiy Bridge as a mitigation, but the UAF attacked that effort as well, causing the Russians to abandon it. The Russians were left at the end with barges ferrying supplies, equipment, and reinforcements from the east to the west bank. The UAF attacked the barges and landing areas as well, but the ferry system was in any case insufficient to supply the 20,000-some Russian mechanized troops trying to hold their lodgment on the western bank of the river. It was clear that the Russians would be unable to defend that lodgment by the time Russian Army General Sergey Surovikin took command of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on October 8. Surovikin signaled his intention to withdraw from western Kherson almost immediately and likely began setting conditions to retreat within a couple of weeks. [] Putin likely elevated Surovikin and let him withdraw from western Kherson on condition that he take the rest of Donetsk Oblast using Russian forces recouped from western Kherson as well as newly-arriving mobilized servicemen. This observation offered by Andriy Zagorodnyuk, chairman of the Ukrainian Center of Defense Strategies, is the likeliest explanation for the resumption in the intensity of Russian offensive operations first around Bakhmut and then to the southwest around the Vuhledar area that began on October 28. These offensive efforts otherwise make little operational sense. [] Russian offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast will intensify in the coming weeks as additional mobilized servicemen arrive along with forces withdrawn from western Kherson. Ukrainian forces in the area will find themselves hard-pressed, and Kyiv will very likely have to divert troops to defend against these renewed Russian offensives. The Russians are not likely to make operationally significant gains despite their renewed efforts, although they could conceivably take Bakhmut over time at enormous cost. Russian mobilized servicemen have shown themselves to be inadequately trained, poorly equipped, and very reluctant to fight. They are not arriving in cohesive units but rather are being sent largely as individual or small unit replacements to units that have been fighting without rest for nine months, have suffered devastating losses in men and equipment, and are largely demoralized themselves. Russian forces operating in Donetsk Oblast include conventional units of the regular Russian Armed Forces, mobilized servicemen, Wagner Private Military Company troops, BARS (Russian volunteer reserve) formations, militia units from the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics, soldiers from Ramzan Kadyrovs Chechen units, and volunteer battalions. This bizarre congeries of combat forces will have considerably less effective combat power than would a grouping of regular units of similar size. It is extremely unlikely that Surovikin will be able to forge it into a force able to conduct large-scale offensive mechanized maneuver warfare, particularly since he is not even taking (or being allowed to take) the time to build a coherent strike force before hurling it into the attack. This weird mix of forces will likely make some gains through sheer weight of numbers, but Ukrainian defenders, likely reinforced, will most probably force it to a halt over the next few months not far from its starting points. Ukraine will also likely recoup combat power from western Kherson and redeploy it to other areas for both defensive and counter-offensive operations. The UAF could conceivably try to chase the Russians across the Dnipro River at various points but is unlikely to do so because the logistics of supporting a Ukrainian lodgment on the eastern bank are very daunting. The UAF is therefore more likely to consolidate its control of the western bank, leave enough force to deter any Russian attempt to cross the river again, and reallocate forces to other areas. The Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast will likely require the UAF to divert some forces to defend in that area, but the UAF will likely send at least part of the recouped combat power either to reinforce its ongoing counter-offensive in Luhansk Oblast or to open another counter-offensive somewhere else (we will not speculate about where that might be). Ukrainian forces have continued to make limited gains in Luhansk Oblast and will likely be able to make more gains if they are reinforced by troops from western Kherson. The Russians are also reinforcing their defensive positions in Luhansk Oblast, to be sure, but the UAF has been grinding forward nevertheless, and there is no reason to forecast that the ill-trained, ill-equipped, and low-morale Russian reservists will be able to stop Ukrainian troops, buoyed by their victories, from advancing. A cessation or prolonged slowing of combat operations over the next few months is therefore very unlikely. The Russians are emphatically not attempting to establish and strengthen defensive positions all along the line but are rather renewing offensive operations in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainians will almost certainly continue their counter-offensive operations already underway. Both sides are already fighting in very muddy conditions. They will not likely stop fighting when winter freezes the ground and makes it even more conducive to large-scale mechanized maneuver warfare. Combat is more likely to intensify than to slacken as temperatures drop. Any attempt at a ceasefire or cessation of hostilities at this time would overwhelmingly favor Russia. Putin should desire such a ceasefire in his own interest. He should recognize that he needs to give his forces time to recover and allow the reservists flowing into the theater time to integrate into their units, train up, and prepare for serious combat. He should want to stop the Ukrainians from capitalizing on the emotional lift of their recent victories. The fact that Putin continues to whip his generals to offensives in these circumstances is thus a grave error from a military perspective. It likely results from whatever psychological factors led Putin to order the invasion in the first place but also increasingly from Putins need to show his toughness to the hardline faction led, at least in public, by Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin. Putin is unlikely to be willing to seek a ceasefire, therefore, unless it is accompanied by tremendous Ukrainian or international concessions. Napoleon famously quipped: Never interrupt your enemy whilst he is in the midst of making a mistake. That aphorism has never been truerUkraine and its backers should take advantage of Putins error by continuing to press the counter-offensive in circumstances far more favorable to Kyiv than to Moscow. Ukraine has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival even with the victory in western Kherson, finally. The city of Melitopol and surrounding areas, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, land on the east bank of the lower Dnipro River, and territory in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are all vital terrain for Ukraine, as ISW has previously argued. Discussions about the future of Crimea and other Ukrainian lands illegally occupied by Russia after 2014 are premature. Ukraine must liberate tens of thousands of square kilometers short of those areas if it is to be able to defend itself against future Russian attacks and reestablish a functional economy. Ukrainians and the West must bend every effort to enabling the liberation of those lands as rapidly as possible before worrying about what lies beyond them. Momentum is an important factor in war. Ukraine has it now. Kyiv and its partners must make the most of it.

Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed an amendment to a draft law that would allow Russian officials to revoke Russian citizenship for disseminating \"false\" information about the Russian military, participating in extremist or undesirable organizations, or calling for violations of Russian \"territorial integrity.\"\n\nRussias war hawks step up criticism of the military over Khersons withdrawal, The New York Times reports. \"Even Vladimir Putin and the Russian government were targeted, but there was no evidence that the volume of blame would be a real liability. Russias pro-war activists delivered over the weekend their most cutting criticism of the militarys performance in Ukraine to date, following the humiliating withdrawal of Russian troops from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson. By Sunday, the drumbeat of denunciations broke the taboo against singling out President Vladimir V. Putin himself and Russias very system of government.\n\nAleksandr Dugin the right-wing ideologue whose concept of a \"Russian World\" helped inspire the war wrote online that the main job of an autocratic leader is to protect the people and the lands under his control. \"The authorities in Russia cannot surrender anything else,\" Mr. Dugin wrote. \"The limit has been reached.\" []\n\nThe Communist Party faction in the Duma, or Russian Parliament, which rarely challenges the Kremlin, proposed demanding an explanation from the Ministry of Defense for ordering the withdrawal from Kherson. Mr. Putins governing United Russia faction torpedoed that proposal.\n\nSome analysts suggested that the flow of criticism indicated that Mr. Putin had failed to distance himself from the repeated setbacks in the war but that the volume had yet to constitute a real liability.\n\nMatters are definitely getting worse for Putin, but it is hard to know the extent because he has crossed so many lines and has still been able to keep control of his inner circle and those who matter, said Maxim Trudolyubov, a political analyst and former newspaper editor now living in exile. So far they have been successful in doing damage control.\n\nTop Russian officials and the state news media have taken the line that the withdrawal from Kherson was a temporary, tactical measure and that Russias annexation of the territory a move condemned as illegal by Ukraine and the West still holds.\n\nSome of the most pointed criticism of the military comes from social media accounts linked to the Wagner Group, a mercenary army whose founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has been critical of the generals. So the military might be prone to dismiss the criticism as trying to make them look bad. Wagner, in general, advocates greater violence as the answer to any setbacks. []\n\nThe Dugin post, which appeared on the website of the Tsargrad TV network, owned by a right-wing tycoon who endorses the restoration of a czar, suggested that the Kremlin was failing because it was relying on public relations rather than a real commitment to the \"Russian idea.\" The post did not name Mr. Putin directly, but made reference to a study of myths and religions that included the African tale of Kings of the Rain, slain for failing to make it rain amid a drought. []\n\nOleg Pakholkov, the editor in chief of Bloknot, a southern regional outlet, noted that the defenders in Stalingrad had the choice to fall back across the Volga River but did not so they could break Russian forces and grind him down and to prove to the world that we can. The surrender of Kherson says the opposite, he wrote. So soon those who took Kherson will come to other places. It looks like we have nothing with which to stop them.\n\nA few commentators wondered aloud why Russia did not use its nuclear arsenal, and why the Russian military was not bombing the routes in western Ukraine used to import military supplies from the United States and Europe. Although it is a crime to question the war or the military directly, Mr. Putin thus far has been tolerant of zealots on the right who have criticized Russia as not fighting hard enough.\n\nStill, even those charged with selling the official line that the withdrawal was merely a maneuver and that Russia would be back had trouble explaining Kherson. Vladimir Solovyov, one of the chief Kremlin cheerleaders on state television, swung between anger and frustration on his several talk shows. One minute he was blaming the West for arming Ukraine, and the next railing against the incompetence and cowardice of some Russians who refused to fight. []\n\nSome critics took the opportunity to raise questions about a system that vested so much authority in one man. His decisions are not up for discussion, an editorial in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper, said of Mr. Putin. Therefore, he himself cannot make mistakes because there is no mechanism to correct them. A leader who admits a mistake lowers his status, which puts his qualities into doubt. Nezavisimaya Gazetas owner and editor, Konstantin Remchukov, is a member of the Russian establishment. []\"\n\nRussia faces a medicine shortage and planned operations are being postponed due to sanctions Ukrainian intelligence, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU). \"Russias Ministry of Health has reportedly ordered every region to create an emergency four-month reserve stock of medication. [DIU] offered a number of reasons why the order has been issued:\n\nthe effect of international sanctions on the Russian economy, as a result of which the pharmaceutical industry is not able to produce sufficient quantities of medicine;\n\nthe real risk of [medical] supplies from abroad coming to a complete halt;\n\nan increase in the intensity of combat action, causing a rise in the number of injured soldiers.\n\nAccording to [DIU], Russian surgeons privately admit that medicine stocks are plummeting. This is having a knock-on effect on surgery planned operations are being postponed indefinitely and the medical sector in general. In addition, medical stocks are not being replenished, which is driving up prices for medicine.\"\n\nWinter will be a major factor in the Ukraine war, officials say, The New York Times reports. \"Senior Biden administration officials say Russias military operations in Ukraine will remain stalled well into next year, as recent Ukrainian advances upset Moscows hopes to seize more territory in areas that President Vladimir V. Putin has tried to portray as historically part of Russia. While the officials say that Moscow is likely to continue to attack Ukrainian troops, bases, infrastructure and the electrical grid, the coming winter is expected to bring a slowdown in military advances on both sides. []\n\nThe winter pause could last as long as six months. Rain and soft ground in late November will slow the movements of both militaries. Then, as temperatures fall and the ground freezes, it will be easier for tanks and trucks to move. But the possibility of heavy snows and even colder weather could make it difficult for the poorly equipped Russian army to mount any new offensive.\n\nYoure already seeing the sloppy weather in Ukraine slow things down a little bit, Colin H. Kahl, the under secretary of defense for policy, told reporters this past week. Its getting really muddy, which makes it hard to do large-scale offensives.\n\nWith a weather-enforced pause in major military movements, the war will enter a new phase. Russia will likely intensify its attacks on infrastructure to terrorize Ukrainians, US officials said. And Ukraine could step up a covert campaign designed to show that it can strike back even on Russian soil, according to analysts. []\n\nBiden administration officials say that it is imperative to use the winter slowdown to rebuild Ukraines defensive and offensive weapons supply. On Thursday, the Pentagon announced another $400 million in weapons, including mobile short-range Avenger air defense vehicles that fire Stinger missiles.\n\nBut officials in Kyiv say they will need more air defense systems, beyond the SA-11s and S-300s Ukraines military already has, which have kept Russian pilots largely out of Ukrainian airspace, and more tanks and even fighter jets to retake areas that Mr. Putin has illegally annexed over the past nine months of war. During the looming pause, both sides will also retrain troops and gear up for a renewed push in February, military analysts said. []\n\nThe Kremlin would certainly like to see a cease-fire put into place in the coming months to replenish its military and strengthen its position on the ground, two Russia military analysts wrote in a Royal United Services Institute analysis last week. The analysts, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds, said the Russian government was encouraging Ukraines international partners to pressure the government in Kyiv into negotiating a truce. []\n\nAnd several military analysts say it is not in Ukraines interests to let up this winter, particularly as Russia continues targeting civilian infrastructure and the electrical grid. Ukrainian officials say they believe Russia is also likely to attack the countrys water supply systems. But Biden administration officials said there could be a limit to how long Russia can continue its campaign to destroy infrastructure as its supplies of long-range precision-guided missiles dwindle. []\n\nWith the equipment problems and an infusion of newly drafted soldiers who will need to be trained, Russia is most likely hoping to use a winter pause to rebuild, American officials said.\n\nFor Ukraine, winter conditions will make the logistics for conventional operations to reclaim territory more difficult, while the lack of vegetation and other cover will make advances with limited armor risky, the Royal Institute analysts wrote. For Russia, with demoralized forces and poorly prepared positions, the winter is likely to see a further slump in morale and significant casualties from exposure injuries.\n\nHans Petter Midttuns assessment\n\nThe Russian-instigated war in Europe has lasted for nearly 9 years. It has already lasted nearly as long as both World War 1 and 2 combined. The war has triggered a nuclear stand-off and the biggest refugee crisis since WW2. More than 7,8 million have sought shelter outside Ukraine while as many as 17,7 million are internally displaced. Ukrainians are being forcibly displaced. Filtration and concentration camps an echo of a horrific past have been set up. The war has potentially killed 150-200,000 Ukrainians and 80,000 Russians (soldiers).\n\nLike the two world wars, this has also turned into a war with global repercussions. Hunger and poverty have increased. The international finance market is weakened. Maritime trade and the freedom of navigation are suffering. The international security architecture that is the basis for our security, stability, and well-being is being challenged. This war is dividing the world.\n\nWorse still, the divide is increasing the longer Russia is allowed to wage war against Ukraine and the West. Not because of Russian \"military success\", but because the US and NATO remain deterred by Russia despite its many defeats and systematic problems.\n\nTwo blocks are clearly emerging over the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia is being supported militarily by Syria, Iran, and North Korea, but indirectly by the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). They have abstained from joining the Western sanctions and condemnation of the Russian aggressions. Its invasion of Ukraine has resulted in growing tensions between China and the West.\n\nIn his speech at the Valdai International Discussion Club on 27 October, President Putin tried to rally non-Western countries to join it in its fight against the \"evil empire\". The message is: Russia is fighting Western global dominance. Join us, or suffer the consequences of its efforts to colonize and enslave nations. He portrayed the ongoing war in Ukraine as evidence of the Western quest for global dominance. He mirrored Russian aggressions and atrocities upon the US and Europe.\n\nUkraine, however, is receiving defense aid from the US-led Defense Contact Group tomorrow of more than 50 countries. Both NATO, the EU, and their member states are committed to the support of Ukraine with non-military means.\n\nAdditionally, the great majority of the UN General Assembly has remained steadfast in its condemnation of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe General Assembly resolution from March 2 demanding an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its troops, and protection for all civilians was supported by 141 (5 opposed and 35 abstentions).\n\nThe resolution from March 24 blaming Russia for Ukraines humanitarian crisis and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools, and hospitals critical to their survival, was supported by 140 (5 opposed and 38 abstentions).\n\nOn April 7, 93 countries supported the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council over allegations that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were engaged in human rights violations. 24 opposed and 58 abstained.\n\nOn October 12, the assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn Russias \"attempted illegal annexation\" of four Ukrainian regions and demand an immediate reversal. 143 in favor, 5 against, and 35 abstentions.\n\nWhile the West has been seeking to contain Russia and reduce its ability to wage war, Russia is not isolated. On the contrary, the world finds itself increasingly divided. According to University of Cambridge researchers, global public attitudes toward international politics are merging into two opposing blocks: liberal democracies versus authoritarianism a long-lasting process accelerated by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Russias war has led people in the West to feel ever greater allegiance to both the US and NATO and brought wealthier democracies in Latin America and Eastern Europe towards a pro-American stance.\n\nHowever, the report also identifies a zone of illiberal and undemocratic societies, stretching from East Asia through the Middle East and out towards West Africa, characterized by the exact opposite trend: populations that have steadily increased support for China, Russia, or both, in recent years.\n\nAmong the 1.2 billion people who inhabit the worlds liberal democracies, three-quarters (75%) now hold a negative view of China, and 87% a negative view of Russia, according to the report, published today by the Universitys Centre for the Future of Democracy (CFD).\n\nYet among the 6.3 billion who live in the worlds remaining 136 countries, the opposite is the case with 70% of people feeling positively towards China and 66% towards Russia.\"\n\nThe 9 year-long war has become a war of attrition. It has come down to who has the biggest resilience and resolve. Who is willing to do what it takes to end the war on its terms? Who is willing to go the extra mile and is willing to take additional risks? Not least, who are willing to escalate and take additional costs to ensure victory?\n\nOne of the first things I remember learning at the Naval Academy decades ago was that both \"will and ability\" are crucial for the conduct of military operations. While the US and NATO have superior capabilities, Russias will to do what it takes is by far greater.\n\nWhile Russian public support for the war is dwindling, the voice of the pro-war fraction is becoming increasingly louder. For each military setback, they advocate greater violence as a response. This has been reflected on the battlefield.\n\nUnfortunately, the pro-war fraction has President Putins attention. The Times alleges that:\n\n\"By the beginning of 2020, the only men in Putins inner circle were his oldest, most trusted and tragically for Russia and Ukraine most hawkish and paranoid allies. The invasion of 2022 was, in the minds of the Soviet-era fantasists who planned and pushed it, first and foremost a pre-emptive strike to save Russia from a looming strategic threat from the West.\n\nUkraine was merely the battlefield where the two former superpowers interests came into direct confrontation the location for what Putins closest circle imagined was a millennial battle between the two sides. \"Ukraine does not exist,\" Viktor Zolotov, Putins former bodyguard who now heads the powerful Russian National Guard, told Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of the Echo Moskvy radio station. It is the border of America and Russia.\"\n\nKremlin is still being asked to do what it has been doing since 2014: Escalate. Do what it takes to be victorious.\n\nTheir advice will continue unrelenting until they realize that the war cannot be won. They are not there today and the ones capable of convincing them to remain reluctant to do what is needed. In the meantime, the global repercussions increases in scale and scope.",

And he never acknowledged Bogdan as his son,\" Olenikova told RFE/RL.\n\n\"And then Bogdan died\" and that acknowledgement followed quickly afterward, she said.\n\nTens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin launched the unprovoked invasion in February, according to Kyiv and Western intelligence agencies.\n\nFotin's quest for a big chunk of the compensation is not unique: Among other strains in Russian society, the war is shedding light on the problem of absentee fathers and widening rifts in families that have already fallen apart.\n\nNearly one-fifth of Russian children are raised by single mothers, with fathers in many of those cases refusing to pay alimony in full or at all and taking no part in the upbringing of their child.\n\nRussia has promised compensation of at least 12 million rubles ($200,000) to families of soldiers killed in what the government calls the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nFor the vast majority of Russians, that is a very large sum -- and in some cases it is fueling fights over compensation payments as the bodies of the dead return home, particularly when the soldier killed has been raised by a single parent.\n\n'A Normal Practice'\n\nMany of the soldiers fighting in Ukraine today were born in the 1990s, when the breakdown of the two-parent family in Russia accelerated amid severe economic hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"This is generally a normal practice in Russia, when the father appears and takes the money,\" said Olenikova, adding that an acquaintance just won a similar fight against her ex-husband.\n\nAs the Russian death toll rises, more stores of disputes between parents emerge.\n\nOlesya Badrtdinova, 42, who raised three boys mostly by herself in the Transbaikal region in Russia's Far East, is fighting to prevent her ex-husband -- who has another family -- from receiving millions of rubles in compensation for the death of their 21-year-old son, Vladislav.\n\nIn the Volgograd region in the south, Marina Gorbunova is suing to prevent her ex-husband from receiving compensation for the death of their 28-year-old son, Sergei Semyonov. Gorbunova described her ex-husband as an alcoholic who had taken no part in their son's life since he was 5 years old.\n\nAt the request of a mother, a court in Saratov in Russia's Volga region ruled a biological father was not entitled to receive compensation for the death of their son after she proved that he had not helped raise him or paid alimony.\n\nGorbunova and Olenikova also said that their ex-husbands did not pay alimony.\n\nCritics say that Russian authorities do not hold fathers accountable for supporting their children, and women are often hesitant to turn to a legal system widely seen as corrupt for help in obtaining child support. Even if they win in court, there is no strong mechanism to ensure enforcement and many men hide their full income.\n\nSome single Russian mothers who had not been receiving support from their ex-husbands saw a silver lining in Putin's September 21 announcement of a mobilization under which the state says more than 200,000 men have been drafted into service.\n\nThey began informing recruitment centers about the whereabouts of their ex-husbands.\n\nThe Defense Ministry announced on October 31 that mobilization had ended, though many experts say the Kremlin could again resort to a draft as the war carries on.\n\nDead To Me\n\nThe government has promised to pay mobilized men around 200,000 rubles ($3,300) a month, roughly triple the average wage in Russia. Because the payments are official, ex-wives can legally demand their share as alimony or child support.\n\nYekaterina Kotova told RFE/RL that she sent the contact information of her ex-husband to enlistment officers because she, like other women, believes they will be \"faster than court bailiffs\" at securing alimony.\n\nIf their ex-husbands were killed, they and their children would be entitled to millions of rubles.\n\n\"For me, my ex-husband as a person died a long time ago,\" Lilia Sergeyeva, who also handed over information about her husband to enlistment officials, told RFE/RL. \"If he is sent to fight and he does not survive, I will receive official confirmation that he does not exist and, accordingly, all payments due to the heirs.\"\n\nOlenikova and Gorbunova said they were not after the money that that their ex-husbands are seeking following the deaths of their sons, but would be happy for it to go to charity.\n\nOlenikova says she only decided to sue Fotin after he tried to claim Bogdan's car as his inheritance. \"That was the last straw for me. He doesn't need a car, he'll sell it. For me, the car is the only remaining memory of my son,\" she said.\n\nGennady Korovin, Fotin's lawyer, declined to comment when reached by RFE/RL. Olenikova says that Fotin has refrained from appearing in court, claiming he is \"embarrassed\" by his own behavior.\n\nOlenikova buried her son as Bogdan Khoryushin, using the last name of her second husband of 19 years, who helped raise him.\n\n\"My son never wanted to bear this surname -- Fotin. He hated his father with a fierce hatred,\" she said.\n\nWritten by Todd Prince based on reporting by RFE/RL's Siberia.Realities",

                "cc_text": "November 10, 8pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nUkrainian forces steadily advanced in Kherson Oblast on November 10 as Russian forces conduct a withdrawal to the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian military officials and geolocated social media footage confirm that Ukrainian troops have made gains northwest, west, and northeast of Kherson City in the past 24 hours and advanced up to 7km in some areas.[1] Russian forces so far appear to be withdrawing in relatively good order, and Ukrainian forces are making expected gains without routing Russian forces, as they did in the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Ukrainian strikes since August have successfully degraded Russian supply lines on the west (right) bank to force Russian forces to withdraw and will liberate Kherson Oblast to the Dnipro River in the coming days or weeks. The Russian withdrawal will take some time to complete, and fighting will continue throughout Kherson Oblast as Ukrainian troops advance and come up against pre-prepared Russian defensive lines, especially around Kherson City.\n\nISW does not assess the fighting in Ukraine will halt or enter a stalemate due to winter weather, despite faulty Western assumptions. NBC News reported on November 9 that some US and Western defense officials are eyeing an \"expected winter slowdown in fighting as an opportunity for diplomacy to begin between Russia and Ukraine.\"[2] Autumn and springtime mud can slow or halt military advances, as can faulty or insufficient wintertime equipment. Some military equipment may need to be adapted for colder weather, and shortages of equipment or ammunition could slow advances due to logistical difficulties not winter weather.[3] Winter weather could disproportionately harm poorly-equipped Russian forces in Ukraine, but well-supplied Ukrainian forces are unlikely to halt their counteroffensives due to the arrival of winter weather and may be able to take advantage of frozen terrain to move more easily than they could in the muddy autumn months. If fighting does halt this winter, it will be due to logistical challenges and the culmination of several campaigns on both sides. The Russian campaigns to capture all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts all culminated months ago (despite the repeated insistence of Russian forces on launching ineffective attacks), and Russian forces are firmly on the defensive across most of the frontline.\n\nUkraine holds the initiative and is in the process of securing a major victory in Kherson. A ceasefire would provide the Kremlin with the pause it desperately needs to reconstitute Russian forces. The major Ukrainian victory underway in Kherson Oblast will not be Ukraines last. Fighting will continue on the southern axis; in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast (the only place Russian forces are still attempting meaningful offensives); and in northern Luhansk Oblast as Ukrainian forces continue counteroffensive operations. Russian officials are busy attempting to train 120,000 conscripts to deploy to the frontlines in the spring.[4] Ukrainian forces likely aim to liberate as much occupied territory as possible before those Russian reinforcements arrive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on November 7 that Ukraine is unwilling to negotiate with Russian forces until certain conditions are met, including the restoration of Ukraines territorial integrity, the prosecution of Russian war criminals, payment for war damages, and promises that Russia will not again invade Ukraine.[5] A wintertime ceasefire would only benefit Russian forces, who would use that opportunity to bolster their faltering defenses and continue their genocidal campaign to eradicate Ukrainian identity in occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nWagner Group financier Yevgeniy Prigozhin is increasingly wrestling with St. Petersburg officials over expanding Wagner Group operations in the city. Prigozhins press service stated that St. Petersburg officials refused to provide a permit for the newly opened Wagner Center in St. Petersburg on a technicality.[6] The press service noted that St. Petersburg officials are deliberately refusing to issue the permit based on their \"ideological\" differences, given that Wagner received the permission to construct the center in July.[7] The press service added that Wagner had petitioned the court and will take the issue further if the court recognizes St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov and his government have committed any \"crimes.\"[8] Prigozhin also accused Beglov and other St. Petersburg \"liberal\" businessmen of financially supporting Ukrainian \"nationalists\" and betraying Russia in response to the situation.[9] Prigozhin has previously accused Beglov of failing to support the Russian war effort and demanded his resignation, likely as a result of resistance from Beglov on expanding Wagners presence in St. Petersburg.[10] ISW also reported that a Russian nationalist outlet Pravda.Ru, which consistently reports on Prigozhin-related news, published a defamatory piece on Beglovs uninterest in creating volunteer battalions in August.[11] Prigozhin is increasingly weaponizing his role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine to push his business aspirations.\n\nUkrainian Air Force Command spokesperson Yuriy Ignat stated that Russian forces will likely further reduce the pace of their campaign to strike Ukrainian critical infrastructure, likely enabling Ukrainian authorities to address most of the damage to infrastructure. Ignat announced on November 10 that on the night of November 9 to 10 Russian forces did not conduct any air or cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian critical infrastructure facilities.[12] Ignat stated that Russian forces have begun to stockpile high-precision weapons systems to launch a future massive campaign reminiscent of the October 10 strikes, because small numbers of daily cruise missile and drone strikes are now generating few results.[13] Ignat stated Russian forces spent months accumulating the high-precision weapons systems they used in the October campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.[14] ISW has previously assessed that Russian forces have greatly depleted their arsenal of high-precision weapons systems and have suffered significant aviation losses and therefore would struggle to maintain the pace of their campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure.[15] It will likely take Russian forces months to accumulate the number of high-precision weapons systems needed to return to the pace of strikes it conducted in mid-October despite Ignats reporting that Russian factories are drastically increasing the manufacturing of cruise missiles.[16] Ukrainian officials have previously stated that they could restore energy supplies to communities in Ukraine within a matter of a few weeks if the pace of the Russian campaign dramatically slowed.[17] ISW also assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have ordered the campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure to curry favor with the Russian pro-war nationalist camp that has been consistently demanding escalation in Ukraine.[18] A reduced pace in the campaign will likely contribute to renewed criticisms from the pro-war nationalist camp. Russian forces likely retain the capability to damage Ukrainian critical infrastructure and impose costs on Ukrainian civilians in the winter but are unlikely to be able to inflict decisive and lasting damage.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nUkrainian forces steadily advanced in Kherson Oblast on November 10 as Russian forces conduct a withdrawal to the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nThe Russian withdrawal will take some time to complete, and fighting will continue throughout Kherson Oblast as Ukrainian troops advance and come up against pre-prepared Russian defensive lines, especially around Kherson City.\n\nISW does not assess the fighting in Ukraine will halt or enter a stalemate due to winter weather, despite faulty Western assumptions.\n\nUkraine holds the initiative and is in the process of securing a major victory in Kherson.

We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesSouthern and Eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts)\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces continued to conduct counteroffensive operations on the Svatove-Kreminna line on November 10. Deputy Chief of the Ukrainian General Staff Oleksiy Hromov announced that Ukrainian forces advanced by two kilometers in an unspecified area of Luhansk Oblast.[19] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults on Novoselivske and Makiivka, about 19km northwest and 21km southwest of Svatove, respectively.[20] The Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation characterized Russian assaults in Luhansk Oblast as unsuccessful small-arms battles.[21] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces made over a dozen unsuccessful assaults along the Svatove-Kreminna line, including an assault on Kuzemivka, about 15km northwest of Svatove.[22] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) also claimed to have repelled Ukrainian attacks in the direction of Stelmakhivka (15km northwest of Svatove) and Ploshchanka (about 16km northwest of Kreminna).[23] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces suppressed Ukrainian reconnaissance-in-force attempts on Orlianka and Kyslivka, about 32km northwest of Svatove.[24] A Russian source also claimed that Ukrainian forces carried out a reconnaissance-in-force in the direction of Chervonopopivka, northwest of Kreminna.[25]\n\nUkrainian forces continued to target Russian logistics in Luhansk Oblast on November 9 and November 10. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Russian forces are moving large quantities of supplies and many reserves in the direction of Svatove-Kreminna but noted that Ukrainian forces continue to shell Russian main supply routes.[26] Social media footage also showed ruined asphalt and muddy roads in Svatove due to the Russian transfer of heavy equipment on poor roads, which may also complicate Russian equipment transfers.[27] Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) ambassador to Russia Rodion Miroshnik claimed on November 10 that Ukrainian forces struck Svatove with two HIMARS missiles.[28] Geolocated images posted on November 10 show the aftermath of Ukrainian HIMARS strikes on Stakhanov and a mine near Krynychne on the night of November 9 to 10.[29]\n\nSouthern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces made substantial gains throughout Kherson Oblast on November 10. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny stated that in the past day, Ukrainian forces have advanced 7km and liberated six settlements in the Petropavlivka-Novoraysk direction (towards Beryslav) and advanced 7km and liberated six settlements in the PervomaiskeKherson City direction (towards Kherson City).[30] Ukraines Southern Operational Command noted that Ukrainian forces have advanced the frontline by 7km and liberated 12 settlements, amounting to over 260 square kilometers of territory in the past day.[31] Zaluzhny stated that since October 1, Ukrainian forces have taken back 41 settlements in the Kherson direction.[32] Ukrainian military sources also reported that Russian troops continue efforts to partially withdraw troops from the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River but emphasized that Russian forces are conducting continued maneuvers on the west bank, statements in line with ISWs assessment that Russian forces will conduct a fighting withdrawal.[33]\n\nSocial media footage and imagery confirmed Ukrainian gains in several sectors. Footage posted to social media shows Ukrainian troops in Kyselivka, a critical settlement along the M14 highway about 14km northwest of Kherson City.[34] Footage also shows Ukrainian soldiers in Pravdyne and Myroliubivka, both within 25km northwest of Kherson City.[35] Social media imagery additionally shows Ukrainian forces have advanced into Oleksandrivka and Stanislav, both about 33km west of Kherson City.[36] Ukrainian forces also made advances north of Beryslav, and social media footage confirms the presence of Ukrainian troops in Kachkarivka (36km northeast of Beryslav), Kucherske (33km north of Beryslav), Borozenske (36km north of Beryslav), Bruskynske (38km northwest of Beryslav), Yehenivka (47km northwest of Beryslav), Bobrovyi Kut (45km northwest of Beryslav), Chkalove (29km northwest of Beryslav), Starystya (34km northwest of Beryslav), and Ishchenka (39km northwest of Beryslav).[37] Geolocated imagery confirms Ukrainian forces liberated Snihurivka, Mykolaiv Oblast (about 43km northeast of Kherson City) and the surrounding settlements of Vasylivka, Pavlivka, and Tamryne.[38]\n\nRussian sources discussed Ukrainian ground maneuvers in Kherson Oblast on November 10, with some confirming that Ukrainian troops have taken control of several settlements northwest, west, and northeast of Kherson City.[39] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) continued to emphasize claimed strikes on Ukrainian concentration areas through Kherson Oblast, likely to detract focus on Russian territorial losses.[40]\n\nUkrainian forces continued their successful interdiction campaign against Russian concentration areas and military assets to support ongoing counteroffensive actions in Kherson Oblast on November 10. Advisor to the Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Head, Serhiy Khlan, stated that a Ukrainian strike hit Russian equipment in Oleshky, 7km southeast of Kherson City.[41] Local residents and Ukrainian officials also reported strikes in the BeryslavNova Kahkovka area between November 9 and 10.[42]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on November 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults around Bakhmut near Soledar (10km northeast), Klishchiiivka (6km southwest), Mayorsk (20km south), Yakovlivka (15km northeast), Andriivka (9km southwest), and Bilohorivka (20km northeast).[43] Ukrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksiy Hromov reported that Russian forces continued to suffer significant losses in the Bakhmut direction and National Guard of Ukraine representative Mykola Urshalovych stated that Russian forces continue to make suicidal attempts to launch assaults on Ukrainian positions around Bakhmut with \"maniacal persistence.\"[44] Urshalovych noted that Russian forces are constantly conducting reconnaissance-in-force, which he said indicates that Russian forces have a low level of equipment within intelligence units. A Russian source stated that the Wagner Group is trying to advance to the city limits of Bakhmut on the eastern outskirts of the city, and that Russian forces attacked Ukrainian positions northeast of Bakhmut near Yakovlivka.[45] Ukrainian and Russian sources also claimed that Russian forces, including elements of the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) 6th Cossack Regiment, continued fighting northeast of Bakhmut in Soledar.[46] Russian sources also claimed that Russian forces fully captured Bakhmutske and that Russian forces and the Wagner Group control 4050% of Bilohorivka.[47] Russian forces continued routine shelling along the line of contact in the Bakhmut area.[48]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in the AvdiivkaDonetsk City area on November 10. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Vesele, Nevelske, Pervomaiske, and Novomykhailivka, all along an arc of the western outskirts of Donetsk City.[49] The Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) militia claimed that Russian forces struck Ukrainian transports, ammunition depots, and strongholds in the vicinity of Pervomaiske.[50] A Russian source reported that Russian forces conducted ground assaults near Novomykhailivka to reach Konstantinivka and cut off the road to Marinka from the south.[51] Russian sources claimed that tense battles are ongoing towards Opytne and Marinka.[52] Russian forces conducted routine shelling in the AvdiivkaDonetsk City area.[53]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast on November 10. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces entered Pavlivka (45km southwest of Donetsk City) and claimed that Ukrainian forces retreated to the northern outskirts of the settlement, where they retain control.[54] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) posted footage of the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet operating in southern Donetsk and reported that Russian forces struck down a portion of nine Ukrainian UAVs near Yehorivka.[55] As ISW has previously observed, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade recently sustained substantial losses in this area and is likely fighting severely understrength.[56] Ukrainian Eastern Joint Forces Operation reported that Russian forces carried out a missile attack on Vuhledar.[57] Russian forces otherwise continued routine shelling along the line of contact in western Donetsk Oblast and eastern Zaporizhia Oblast.[58]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces have begun constructing second-line defensive fortifications in Crimea and southern Ukraine, standard military practices that do not necessarily indicate an imminent Russian expectation of defending Crimea. American satellite imagery company Planet Labs published satellite photos on November 10 showing new trenches and restored defensive fortifications near Armiansk in Russian-occupied Crimea and near Chonhar, Kherson Oblast.[59] Ukrainian Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov reported on November 10 that Russian forces have also begun strengthening fortifications near Melitopol to protect the land corridor to Crimea.[60] The construction of defensive fortifications on secondary lines of defense is standard military procedure, one that Russian forces have not previously conducted at scale in northern Crimea and elsewhere in southern Ukraine. The construction of these new defensive fortifications is not an indicator that Russian forces expect to defend Crimea from a Ukrainian offensive in the near future.\n\nRussian forces continued routine air, missile, and artillery strikes west of Hulyaipole and in Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv Oblasts.[61] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Vilniansk, Zaporizhia Oblast.[62]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nMobilized men and their relatives continue to oppose the war through protests, social media dissent, and attempted desertions. Poor treatment and provisioning of mobilized Russian personnel are likely driving surrenders and desertions, as well as protests by the families of mobilized personnel within Russia. Russian forces are reportedly detaining those who refuse to fight (refuseniks) in a network of inhumane prisons in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, according to a November 10 report by the Ukrainian Telegram channel ASTRA.[63] Russian authorities reportedly beat, starve, and pressure the refuseniks until they agree to return to the frontlines. A group of imprisoned men in Zaitseve, Luhansk Oblast told the outlet that they were sent to the frontlines around October 20 after very little training, whereupon their officers abandoned them without communications or logistics capabilities for eight days. The men walked about 60km to Starobilsk, where their relatives rented a bus to bring them home. Russian forces detained the men at the border and imprisoned them in a Zaitseve basement instead. Relatives of forcibly mobilized Russian men in Vologda Oblast shared a video on November 10 demanding that their mobilized family members be returned from Svatove, Luhansk Oblast due to poor training and leadership on the front.[64]\n\nRussian mobilization efforts are channeling mobilized Russian personnel to the Wagner Group, indicating the increasing importance of Wagner to Russian combat capabilities. Russian-language opposition outlet Agency News reported on November 10 that mobilized men from Omsk Oblast received military IDs that did not identify them as mobilized personnel, which then allowed Russian authorities to send the mobilized men to fight alongside the prisoners recruited by Wagner.[65] Private military companies are unconstitutional in Russia, and mobilized personnel cannot legally be deployed to fight with any armed group other than the Russian military. Wagner forces reportedly use the prisoners as cannon fodder to draw Ukrainian fire and keep actual Wagner personnel out of harms way, as ISW has previously reported.[66] Ukrainian National Guard Colonel Mykola Urshalovych noted on November 10 that Wagner prisoner recruits are the most likely demographic of all Russian forces to surrender to the Ukrainian National Guard, likely due to their poor treatment and dangerous deployments.[67]\n\nPro-Russian milbloggers and military units continue to call for economic mobilization to support the war effort. A Telegram channel affiliated with the BARS-13 reservist militia argued on November 10 that Russian authorities need to begin mobilizing the Russian economy and engaging in economic activities that will support Russian forces at the front.[68] A Russian milblogger wrote on November 10 that Russias reliance on Iranian-made drones and other systems humiliates the Russian military industry and deprives Russia of the chance to develop and produce suitable Russian-made modern weapons systems.[69] The milblogger called for better funding to the Russian military-industrial complex and warned that the West will likely eventually cut Russias access to Iranian-made equipment like drones and missiles by overthrowing the Iranian regime.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are likely facing economic repercussions stemming from their policy of forcibly mobilizing men in Russian-occupied areas. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on November 10 that local businesses in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast are suffering major labor shortages because most men are either hiding from mobilization summonses or in the process of being mobilized.[70] The Center reported that Russian forces regularly conduct raids on homes and businesses to find men who are evading mobilization and that several businesses in Makiivka have shut down due to labor shortages. The Center also claimed that Russian officials send mobilized personnel from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine to the front lines with insufficient training and ammunition because deaths among those forcibly mobilized personnel may result in their families hating Ukraine longer-term, driving a wedge between the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian civilians in Russian-occupied areas.\n\nSome Russian citizens are likely continuing to oppose the war through planned or executed attacks on Russian military locations. The Deputy Interior Minister of the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR), Vitaly Kiselev, claimed on November 10 that FSB agents detained an unnamed Russian citizen in Yekaterinburg, Sverdlovsk Oblast and uncovered five incendiary devices which they claimed the person planned to use to attack unspecified \"administrative facilities\" in Yekaterinburg.[71] Kiselev claimed that the Russian citizen was affiliated with \"terrorist\" and \"extremist\" organizations.\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities are reportedly continuing their efforts to identify pro-Ukraine residents in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine but are less invested in creating pro-Russian sentiments among occupied populations. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on November 10 that Russian occupation officials have reduced payments to \"socially vulnerable\" populations in occupied parts of Zaporizhia Oblast since the September 30 pseudo-referenda.[72] The Center reported that those payments were used to acquire passport data to rig the referendum vote and that Russian authorities are stepping up filtration measures and other \"terror tactics\" because they no longer need to buy the goodwill of the occupied population. The Ukrainian Luhansk Oblast Military Administration reported on November 10 that occupation officials installed cameras and microphones in a Novopskov hospital and ordered hospital staff to \"conduct casual conversations with visitors to identify untrustworthy individuals.\"\n\nRussian occupation officials are continuing their attempts to erode Ukrainian national identity among residents of occupied territories while setting conditions to mobilize additional forces from the occupied Ukrainian civilian population years from now. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on November 10 that Russian occupation officials opened branches of the Young Army Cadets National Movement in Henichesk, Kherson Oblast and in Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[73] The Center reported that \"Yunarmia\" is a militaristic association of schoolchildren under the auspices of the Russian Ministry of Defense that is responsible for the \"militarization\" of children. The Center reported that participation is supposedly voluntary, but that Russian officials forcibly enroll schoolchildren in Yunarmia in many Russian oblasts. Yunarmia recruits cadets between the ages of 8 and 18.\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

Meanwhile, public sentiment within Ukraine remains strongly against negotiations unless Russia withdraws from occupied territories, suggesting that domestic pressures could complicate international diplomatic efforts (2,5).",
                "summary": "US officials have been urging Ukraine to demonstrate a willingness to engage in diplomatic discussions with Russia to maintain the moral high ground and to prevent \"Ukraine fatigue\" among international allies concerned about the prolonged conflict and its economic impacts (1,4). Despite substantial US aid, which totals $18.9 billion, there is an awareness that global inflation and the strain on energy and food prices may lead to decreased support from nations already hesitant to back Ukraine's war effort (3,4). Ukrainian President Zelensky has consistently refused negotiations unless Ukraine regains all its territory, but US officials believe he may become more open to talks in the winter (3). The pressure for Ukraine to negotiate is complicated by the Ukrainian public's resistance to talks before Russian withdrawal and concerns over legitimizing Putin's actions amidst allegations of war crimes (2,5).",
                "more_detailed": "US officials have been urging Ukraine to show a willingness to engage in diplomatic discussions with Russia, concerned that the continued conflict with no visible end could lead to a decline in international backing for Ukraine's war effort. This push is not intended to prompt immediate negotiations but rather to maintain the perception of Ukraine's moral high ground and to sustain public support as global fatigue over the war grows (1,3,4,7). With the potential for a change in the US Congress following elections, there is an anticipation that US support for Ukraine may not continue at the current levels, especially if Republicans gain control, as indicated by comments from leading party members about ceasing to offer \"blank checks\" to Ukraine (6,7).\n\nThe Ukrainian populace and its leadership, however, have expressed that meaningful negotiations can only take place once Russia withdraws from Ukrainian territories, with President Zelensky previously stating that talks with Putin are ruled out so long as he remains in power (2). Despite this firm stance, there is a nuanced shift in Zelensky's rhetoric, suggesting a conditional openness to peace talks, although the likelihood of such negotiations leading to a resolution remains low given the preconditions set by Ukraine which Moscow is unlikely to accept (9,10). This complex dynamic underscores the challenges faced by the international community in balancing the need for a peace process with the principle of respecting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Additionally, high-level discussions, such as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's meeting with President Zelensky, have involved urging Ukraine not to categorically rule out talks with Putin, as this could reinforce the Kremlin's narrative and potentially impact Ukraine's international support (9). While ensuring Ukraine's autonomy in decision-making, U.S. officials like Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Milley, have publicly stated that opportunities for negotiation and peace should be seized when they arise, emphasizing that the U.S. is not dictating terms to Ukraine but is ready to support the country in its diplomatic efforts (10)."

                "summary": "The U.S. midterm elections have the potential to reshape the nation's foreign policy, particularly in relation to aid for Ukraine, with predictions that a Republican-controlled Congress might limit the financial support currently provided to Kyiv (2,3). Statements from Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy suggest a growing reluctance within the party to provide Ukraine with unconditional aid, indicating a possible shift in the bipartisan consensus that has thus far characterized U.S. assistance (2). If Republicans take control, President Biden could face challenges in maintaining the same level of support for Ukraine, as well as in his approach to other foreign policy issues like relations with China and Saudi Arabia (1). Despite this, some analysts believe that the fundamental aspects of America's Ukraine policy are unlikely to undergo dramatic changes due to the attitudes of the U.S. establishment and electorate, which have not prioritized Ukraine as a key concern in the elections (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The outcome of the U.S. midterm elections has the potential to reshape the extent and form of American support for Ukraine amidst its conflict with Russia. The existing bipartisan consensus on aiding Kyiv could face challenges if Republicans, who have expressed growing skepticism regarding continued financial commitments to Ukraine, gain control of Congress (2,3,4,5). Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's statement about not providing a \"blank check\" to Ukraine and the Wall Street Journal poll indicating dwindling support among Republican voters for the level of U.S. involvement in Ukraine underscore this shift (2,8). Additionally, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's assurance of unwavering American support to Ukrainians suggests that the administration's stance might face opposition from future lawmakers (7).\n\nThe geopolitical implications of the U.S. elections are significant, with experts positing that the results could influence key global issues such as the war in Ukraine, the U.S.-China relationship, and the global economy (1,6,9). A change in Congressional control could lead to more difficulty for President Biden's administration in pushing through aid for Ukraine, potentially affecting the country's ability to counter Russian aggression (3). This could, in turn, impact the overall geopolitical landscape, as the conflict in Ukraine has become a central point of contention between the U.S.-led West and Russia (10). The possibility of an executive agreement over a formal treaty illustrates the challenges in navigating foreign policy in a politically polarized environment, where bypassing Congress could provoke domestic backlash (4)."

To ensure discussions of peace talks do not undermine Ukraine's position, the country seeks international support, including increased air defense, fighter jets, and calls for a NATO summit to prevent escalation (2). Meanwhile, emphasizing the non-negotiable terms for negotiations serves as a strategy to preserve the morale and focus of the Ukrainian people and their military (1,4).",
                "more_detailed": "Ukraine faces the delicate task of balancing the pursuit of peace talks with the maintenance of strong national resolve and military momentum. Despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decree banning talks with Putin and demands for a full withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations, and punishment for war criminals (1), the U.S. has urged Ukraine to signal openness to diplomatic discussions (7). This approach is aimed not at immediate negotiations but at ensuring Ukraine retains the moral high ground and public support, which could wane without an end to the conflict in sight (7). Additionally, the U.S. advocates for Ukraine to start any potential talks from the strongest position possible, ensuring that negotiations are on Kyiv's terms (6). Maintaining such a stance helps to reinforce Ukrainian resolve and supports the ongoing military efforts, which have been bolstered by significant U.S. aid, enabling Ukraine to regain initiative and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces (6).\n\nTo strengthen its position, Ukraine could adopt measures, as suggested by nuclear experts and military dialogues, that do not require formal treaties but aim to prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use, including maintaining communication lines and holding consultations on military operations (3). By continuing to equip Ukrainians with what is necessary for victory, the nation can seek a fair and lasting peace on its terms (4). Ukrainian officials have already emphasized that any settlement must include the restoration of occupied territories (5), while also pushing back against perceptions of Western pressure to negotiate, reaffirming that talks can only occur if Russia relinquishes territory occupied since the invasion (10). Ukraine's commitment to these principles ensures that discussions of peace talks do not undermine the country's resolve or military efforts and keeps the focus on achieving a sustainable resolution that honors Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity (4,5,10)."

Officials including National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan began more urgently pressing the Ukrainians to shift their rhetoric after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree in early October ruling out any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That decree came in response to Russia's self-declared annexation of territories in eastern Ukraine following sham referendums there. Sullivan discussed the issue directly with Zelensky during a trip to Kyiv last week, the sources said. He expressed the US' view that categorically ruling out any talks with Putin plays into the Russian leader's hand by fueling the Kremlin narrative that the Ukrainians are refusing to talk. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson DmitryPeskovsaid that Russia is \"open to\" negotiation with Ukraine but \"at the moment we do not see such an opportunity, because Kyiv turned into a law [their decision] not to continue any negotiations.\" The Washington Post first reported that the US is urging Ukraine to appear open to talks. The advice to the Ukrainians is also coming ahead on the eve of what could be a tough winter for Europe, which has already been experiencing soaring energy costs tied to Russia's invasion and warnings has warned of potential blackouts and gas rationing stemming from the energy crunch.

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) Ukraines president has suggested hes open to peace talks with Russia, softening his earlier refusal to negotiate with Moscow while President Vladimir Putin is in power while sticking to Kyivs demands.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyys appeal to the international community late Monday to \"force Russia into real peace talks\" reflected a change in rhetoric for a man who signed a decree in late September stating \"the impossibility of holding talks\" with Putin. But since his preconditions appear to be non-starters for Moscow, its hard to see how Zelenskyys latest comments would advance any talks.\n\nZelenskyy reiterated that his conditions for dialogue were the return of all of Ukraines occupied lands, compensation for damage caused by the war and the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nWestern weapons and aid have been key to Ukraines ability to fight off Russias invasion, which some initially expected would tear through the country with relative ease. But U.S. midterm elections Tuesday will define the amount and the shape of Washingtons future political and financial support for Ukraine.\n\nWhile that support has garnered strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, a growing conservative opposition could complicate that next year if Republicans take control of the House.\n\nRecent comments from Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, saying lawmakers would not cut a \"blank check\" to Ukraine have more clearly reflected the partys growing skepticism about the cost of support for Kyiv.\n\nIn private, Republican lawmakers who support aid to Ukraine say there could be an opportunity to pass one more tranche of assistance this year with the current Congress.\n\nRussia and Ukraine held several rounds of talks in Belarus and Turkey early on in the war, which is now nearing its nine-month mark, and Zelenskyy initially even called for a personal meeting with Putin something the Kremlin has brushed off.\n\nThe talks stalled after the last meeting of the delegations, held in Istanbul in March, yielded no results.\n\nZelenskyy said Monday that Kyiv has \"repeatedly proposed (talks) and to which we always received crazy Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail.\"\n\nRussia resumed calls for talks after Ukraines successful counteroffensive in the east and the south of the country began in September but ever since Putin illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine, Kyiv has rejected the possibility of negotiating with him.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday listed conditions for the dialogue to begin, including the \"restoration of (Ukraines) territorial integrity compensation for all war damage, punishment for every war criminal and guarantees that it will not happen again.\"\n\nRussias deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, stressed on Tuesday that Moscow is not setting any conditions for the resumption of talks and accused Kyiv of lacking \"good will.\"\n\n\"This is their choice, we have always declared our readiness for such negotiations,\" Rudenko said.\n\nUkraines presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak insisted in a tweet Monday that \"Ukraine has never refused to negotiate,\" but first, Russia needs to withdraw its troops from the country. \"Is Putin ready? Obviously not,\" Podolyak wrote.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, which the Russians are struggling to take full control of, Moscows shelling killed three civilians and wounded seven others over the past 24 hours, according to Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nKyrylenko said the fatalities occurred in the city of Bakhmut, a key target of Russias grinding offensive in Donetsk, and the town of Krasnohorivka. Ukraines deputy defense minister last week described the Bakhmut area as \"the epicenter\" of fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, two civilians were seriously wounded by unexploded mines in Ukraines northeastern Kharkiv region, where Kyivs forces retook broad swaths of territory in September, Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\n\nIn the partially occupied Kherson region in the south, where Ukraines troops are conducting a successful counteroffensive, Russian-installed authorities said they have \"completed\" measures to evacuate residents ahead of anticipated Ukrainian advances.\n\nThe Kremlin-appointed administration had sought to relocate tens of thousands of people in anticipation of a Ukrainian advance deeper into the region. Ukrainian military and civilian officials have previously described the relocation measures as \"forced displacement.\" Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kremlin-backed administration, has repeatedly denied that.\n\nRussian-backed officials in Kherson announced that motorized ferries transporting civilians across the Dnieper River and deeper into Russian-held territory were no longer running. According to the announcement, made Monday on Telegram, the main remaining relocation route is across the Antonivskiy Bridge, which Ukrainian attacks have repeatedly damaged and is now operated by the Russian military.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations reassured Ukrainian farmers that extending a wartime deal that allowed Ukrainian grain and other commodities to be shipped on the Black Sea was a priority for the U.N. The agreement is set to expire on Nov. 19.\n\n\"I am here seeing Ukraine as the breadbasket of the world. This (war) really has had an impact on the entire global food market,\" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said while speaking to farmers and reporters at a grain storage facility in Kyiv.\n\nBrokered by the U.N. and Turkey, the shipping initiative has allowed more than 9 million tons of grain in 397 vessels to leave Ukrainian ports and travel along a designated corridor. Russia briefly suspended its participation in the deal last week, alleging that a Ukrainian drone had attacked its Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Oct. 29.",

It could serve as a springboard for more advances into occupied territory.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden called it a \"significant victory\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"I can do nothing but applaud the courage, determination and capacity of the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian military,\" he said on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Indonesia. \"They've really been amazing. ... were going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves.\"\n\nLarge parts of eastern and southern Ukraine are still under Russian control, and the city of Kherson itself remains within reach of Moscow's shells and missiles. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere in Ukraine. Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti reported the town of Oleshky, in Russian-held territory across the Dnieper River from Kherson, came under heavy artillery fire.\n\nZelenskyy awarded medals to soldiers in Kherson and posed with them for selfies while striking a defiant note.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the end of the war,\" he said. \"We are step by step coming to all the temporarily occupied territories.\"\n\nBut he also grimly noted the fighting \"took the best heroes of our country.\"\n\nThe end of Russias occupation of the city the only provincial capital seized since the February invasion has sparked days of celebration. But as winter approaches, its remaining 80,000 residents are without heat, water and electricity, and short on food and medicine. Zelenskyy says the city is laced with booby traps and mines. And Ukrainian authorities say there are signs of atrocities emerging, just as in other liberated areas.\n\nRussian forces \"destroyed everything in their path, wrecked the entire electricity network,\" he said. Communications operators said cellphone service was being restored and the regional governor said a public wireless internet access point would begin working Tuesday.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has won \"an important victory\" in Kherson and other areas west of the Dnieper, but the Washington-based think tank noted that \"it has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Moscow should not be underestimated.\n\n\"The Russian armed forces retain significant capability as well as a large number of troops, and Russia has demonstrated their willingness to bear significant losses,\" he said in The Hague.\n\nIn Ankara, Turkey, CIA Director Bill Burns met with his Russian intelligence counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, to underscore the consequences if Moscow were to deploy a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, according to a White House National Security Council official.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Burns and Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR spy agency, did not discuss settlement of the war. Their meeting was the highest-ranking face-to-face engagement between U.S. and Russian officials since before the invasion.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have warned for months of the prospect that Russia could use weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine amid battlefield setbacks, Biden administration officials have repeatedly said nothing has changed in U.S. intelligence assessments to suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin has imminent plans to deploy nuclear weapons.\n\nThe UN General Assembly, meanwhile, passed a resolution calling for establishing a mechanism to assess Russian reparations for damages and injuries in Ukraine. The resolution is not binding and Russia's ambassador said it had no legal validity.\n\nZelenskyy's trip to Kherson was another in a series of unexpected visits to front-line areas at crucial moments of the war. It was laden with symbolism and the common touch aimed at boosting the morale of soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nIn a video, a visibly moved Zelenskyy stood with his hand on his heart and sang the national anthem as troops saluted and stood at attention and a soldier raised the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag.\n\nResidents draped with flags on their shoulders cheered, cried and shouted in gratitude as Zelenskyy walked by.\n\n\"Its amazing. Weve been waiting for him for nine months. Thank you,\" said Danila Yuhrenko.\n\nSerhii Yukhmchuk, 47, said he and his wife spent the occupation mostly at home to avoid any Russians and protested by refusing to use the ruble as currency.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on Zelenskyys visit, except to say: \"You know that it is the territory of the Russian Federation.\" Russia illegally annexed the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian provinces earlier this year, in addition to annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nIn his Sunday night address, Zelenskyy said that \"investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, and the bodies of both civilians and military personnel have been found.\"\n\n\"In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country,\" he said. \"We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt.\"\n\nResidents said Russian troops plundered the city and wrecked key infrastructure before retreating across the wide Dnieper River to its east bank last week.\n\nReconnecting the electricity supply is the priority, regional Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said.\n\nThe arrival of winter is making the situation more difficult, with Stoltenberg saying that Putin is aiming \"to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter.\"\n\nBiden said he expected things to slow down somewhat militarily \"because of the winter months and the inability to move as easily around.\"\n\nIn the past two months, Ukraines military claimed to have retaken dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson, a key gateway to Crimea to the south.\n\nBut the grinding war continued with shelling, civilian casualties and each side reporting gains.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had captured the village of Pavlivka in the eastern Donetsk region. Multiple Ukrainian officials have reported heavy battles there in recent weeks.\n\nIn Luhansk, another eastern region illegally annexed by Moscow, Kyivs forces have retaken 12 settlements, said regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said missile and drone strikes have slowed down a bit in Ukraine since the end of October. The U.S. doesnt know the specific reason for the decline, the official said, but noted that Russia continues to see its weapons stockpiles decrease, particularly precision-guided munitions.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide the U.S. military assessment, said Russia continues to hit civilian infrastructure, including the electrical grid, and the U.S. has no reason to believe Moscow will let up on its attacks any time soon.\n\nAsked if the U.S. will scale back its weapons contributions to Kyiv as winter takes hold, and fighting is likely to level off a bit, the official said Washington will continue to work with allies to ensure it has what it needs and that air defence systems will be an ongoing priority.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers John Leicester in Kyiv, Hanna Arhirova in Odesa, Ukraine, and Aamer Madhani and Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed.",

The occupiers destroyed everything themselves - on purpose. This is their special operation.\"\n\n\"On the eve of winter, the Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people. Absolutely all important objects in the city and region are mined,\" he added.\n\nIn a visit to the city on Monday, Mr Zelensky said that Ukraine is \"moving forward\".\n\nKherson was captured in March, weeks after the invasion began. The region was then one of four to be illegally annexed after self-styled referendums in September.\n\nLosing the southern city is a major setback for Russia - though Moscow insists it remains Russian territory. Russia declared it the centre of the illegally annexed Kherson region, and it was the only regional capital to be occupied since the invasion.\n\nPro-Russian billboards on the drive in to the city - along with periodic crumps of artillery - act as a reminder that Russian President Vladimir Putin's men have not left completely, though.\n\nAt a ceremony in Moscow, Putin said the annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson was \"non-negotiable\". Russia still occupies the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014.\n\nThe invasion has left Russia internationally isolated - a fact underlined on Monday by a UN General Assembly resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable over Ukraine.\n\nIt was supported by 94 of the assembly's 193 members and is not binding, but carries political weight.\n\nIt said Russia \"must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts\". Four previous UN resolutions have also criticised Russia's invasion.\n\nIn recent weeks Ukraine has made gains in the south of the country, driving towards Kherson and putting Russian forces under increasing pressure.\n\nLast week, Russian forces withdrew and Ukrainian troops entered the city on Friday.\n\nLocals were seen celebrating, some reuniting with loved ones they had not seen for months. The mood in the city was one of jubilation and relief, but also trepidation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen reports.\n\nEchoing that caution was Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who warned it would be a \"mistake\" to \"underestimate Russia\".\n\n\"The coming months will be difficult,\" he told Dutch government officials. \"Putin's aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course.\"\n\nFootage from social media shows a Ukrainian soldier shouting \"Greetings from Kherson\".\n\nDuring his visit on Monday, Mr Zelensky sang the Ukrainian national anthem as the country's flag was hoisted above the main administrative building.\n\n\"We are ready for peace, but peace for our whole country,\" he said. \"This is the territory of our entire country... That is why we are fighting Russian aggression.\"\n\n\"Step by step,\" he said, \"we are moving towards all the occupied territories of our country. Of course this is difficult. This is a long and difficult path.\"\n\nHe thanked Nato and other allies for their support, adding that high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) from the United States had made a big difference.\n\nThe president also addressed a crowd in the city's main square, some of whom waved Ukrainian flags or wore them draped across their shoulders.\n\nAsked where Ukrainian forces might advance next, he said: \"Not Moscow... We're not interested in the territories of another country.\"\n\nThe president also joked he had come to Kherson because he \"wanted a watermelon\" - in reference to the locally grown fruit which has become a popular Ukrainian symbol of resistance.\n\nUnlike other liberated areas, Kherson is relatively undamaged. The Kremlin tried to make its occupation appear legitimate here.\n\nAs the city emerged from its own kind of lockdown - an oppressive eight-month Russian occupation - shops could this week accept Ukrainian hryvnia for the first in a long time. They had previously been forced to trade with the Russian rouble.\n\nAt a grocery store, which stayed open throughout the occupation, workers said Russian soldiers would \"come in for free beers\". If refused, the soldiers \"said they'd come back and kill us\", the workers claimed.\n\nOne supermarket was pleased to be trading in local currency again\n\nIn response to Mr Zelensky's visit, the Kremlin said that Kherson was part of Russia.\n\n\"We leave this without comment,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding: \"You know, this territory is part of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia would not agree to withdrawing troops as a prerequisite for peace talks.\n\n\"Such conditions are unacceptable,\" the Russian news agency Interfax quoted him as saying on Monday.\n\n\"Our president has repeatedly said that we are ready for talks. But these talks, naturally, should take into account the situation on the ground.\"\n\nEarlier Mr Zelensky said investigators had uncovered more than 400 war crimes in areas of Kherson abandoned by Russian forces as they retreated.\n\nThe BBC has been unable to verify these allegations, and Moscow denies that its troops intentionally target civilians.\n\nReuters\n\nPresident Zelensky with soldiers on Monday",

                "cc_text": "When Russia's defence minister appeared on state media to report that he had ordered a withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River, including from the city of Kherson situated on the east bank, the news was immediately hailed by the western media as a great victory for the Ukrainian army.\n\nThis jubilation was something everyone could understand. Kherson was the only major Ukrainian regional capital city to be occupied by the Russians since the start of the war last February. Recapturing it and pushing the Russians out of the west bank of the river would therefore have immense symbolic and logistical value for Ukraine.\n\nIt would also be a colossal setback for Russia, which needs the area to secure a water supply to Crimea. For those reasons, they had every incentive to defend it.\n\nFor Vladimir Putin, the loss of Kherson was obviously a most embarrassing setback. He had presided over a ridiculously ostentatious ceremony in the Kremlin, striking the studied pose of a nineteenth century Tsar to celebrate the annexation of Kherson and the other three oblasts.\n\nHe was televised signing a document that proclaimed the newly conquered territories were now an inalienable part of the Russian Federation. And he declared to the whole world that: \"We will defend our land with all the powers and means at our disposal.\"\n\nNow, only a few weeks later, he is publicly humiliated by the surrender of Kherson. What better news could there be for the Kyiv government and its western backers? One might have expected an explosion of popular joy and euphoria, accompanied by the sound of trumpets and drums, military parades and defiant speeches from Zelensky announcing new, even more spectacular advances and the imminent defeat of Russia.\n\nInstead, to the worlds astonishment, Zelensky warned against an excessively triumphant interpretation of this development, which he said may be only a move to regroup forces. In the immortal words of Alice in Wonderland, curiouser and curiouser.\n\nHow is it possible to make sense of all this?\n\nTo start with, in this life, not everything is as it seems to be. It is one thing for Putin to make grandiose declarations in the Kremlin, or for Zelensky to make stirring speeches to the adoring dignitaries of foreign parliaments.\n\nBut the practical conduct of the war is in the hands of local commanders, whose most pressing need is to deal with the realities of the situation on the ground and to take the appropriate decisions.\n\nThe Ukraine war is a reflection of the inherent weakness of a bourgeois Bonapartist regime. One can say that, so far, on the Russian side, it has been a war in which political factors have played a far greater role than purely military ones.\n\nFrom the beginning, the driving force has been, on the one hand, NATOs aggressive push towards Russias borders, on the other, the exaggerated ambitions of Vladimir Putin and his desire to enhance his personal prestige and his grip on power, which is closely related to it.\n\nThe desire to confront the aggressive expansion of NATO that is, fundamentally, US imperialism is an aim that can be understood and enjoys widespread support amongst the Russian people, in particular, the working class.\n\nBut the Bonapartist nature of the regime stands in the way of a successful military campaign. Putins personal interference in military decisions played a negative role from the beginning, when he clearly underestimated the dimensions of the problem that he had set out to resolve by the only means he knows violent force.\n\nPutin is the product of capitalist restoration in Russia. He poses as a strong man but in reality, he is the creature of a corrupt and rapacious class of oligarchs who have enriched themselves through the massive theft of state property, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nCorruption is rife in such a system. It is built into its DNA and is its heart and soul. It penetrates all layers of society, from the very top to the bottom. And since any army is only the mirror image of the society that created it, the same corruption will be found there also.\n\nIt is impossible to have an accurate idea of the scale of corruption, robbery, theft, nepotism, favouritism, bullying, bungling and inefficiency that exists in Russias army. There can be little doubt that such factors as these have played a significant role in the failures of the Russian army in the Ukrainian campaign.\n\nA series of embarrassing reversals highlighted serious weaknesses on the Russian side. It has also damaged the personal prestige of Vladimir Putin potentially a serious problem for the \"Strong Man\" in the Kremlin.\n\nIt was this that finally persuaded him that it was necessary to take a step back and leave important tactical issues related to the running of the war more in the hands of commanders of proven worth who are in direct contact with the realities of the battlefield.\n\nThis, together with the long-delayed order to mobilise new forces for the front, might represent a significant change for the better in Russias fortunes.\n\nGeneral Surovikin\n\nEnter General Sergei Surovikin, who was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine on 8 October after the terrorist attack that damaged a strategically important bridge that connected Russia to Crimea. He has been given a bad press in the West, which portrays him as a ruthless man with a reputation for brutality and for bombing civilians in Russias campaign in Syria.\n\nGeneral Surovikin was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine on 8 October / Image: Vitaliy Pikov\n\nThey conveniently forget the brutal American bombing that reduced Mosul to a pile of smoking rubble. They also forget to add that Surovikins Syria campaign was also highly successful. That fact, and not any moral considerations, explains their extreme dislike of the man.\n\nIt is necessary to approach war in its own terms, just as one must approach art, science, or any other subject in its own terms, since what is applicable and appropriate for one is wholly inapplicable and inappropriate to another.\n\nHumanitarianism and the desire to prevent human suffering are, of course, highly praiseworthy. These values are very important, for example, for nursing. But a heavyweight boxer who placed such considerations high on his list of priorities would not win many fights.\n\nBy the same token, a general whose main interest was in saving lives would not win many wars, since wars are, by definition, about killing people. Sad to say, it is precisely the most ruthless generals who are likely to win battles. And we must judge Surovikin, just as we would judge a professional in any other field: solely by the results he achieves.\n\nObviously, the Russian decision to withdraw its troops to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River was of considerable propaganda value for Ukraine and its western backers. But wars are not won or lost on the basis of propaganda. And from a military point of view, it actually made perfectly good sense for the Russians to do just what they have done.\n\nThe western media have made a lot of noise to the effect that the delivery of modern \"smart\" weapons to Ukraine represent a \"game-changer\". That is an exaggeration. HIMARS and other advanced weapons systems in and of themselves are not enough to tip the overall balance of forces.\n\nNevertheless, they were sufficient to create a lot of problems in the Russian rear, weakening their supply lines. In particular, the supply of advanced artillery pieces to the Ukrainians by the west before the summer allowed them to destroy the bridges over the Dnipro and created serious difficulties for keeping the defenders of Kherson supplied with food and ammunition.\n\nThe Ukrainians were advancing on two fronts towards Kherson, threatening to surround the city and effectively cut off its garrison, which would be faced with the alternative of surrendering or being cut to pieces. That indeed would have represented a major defeat for Russia.\n\nFaced with that possibility, Surovikin decided that it was best to preserve the Russian forces and equipment by withdrawing to the east bank of the river, which forms a natural defensive line.\n\nThe fall of Kherson was not achieved by a heroic assault by the Ukrainian army. Indeed, battlefield reports from the BBC on Ukraines side of the Kherson frontline indicated that Kyivs forces might still lack the necessary equipment to achieve that aim.\n\nSo, when reports began to circulate that the Russian forces would probably leave the city and withdraw to the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, they were not taken seriously.\n\nIn fact, the first reaction was incredulity. Was this just a trick? Are they trying to lure us into an ambush? The spokesperson for Ukraines southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, described it as a ruse to draw Ukraine into battle.\n\nEven so, it seems hard to explain the extraordinary degree of caution with which the news of the Russian withdrawal has been met on the Ukrainian side. And there are other things that are even harder to explain.\n\nWhy was there hardly any fighting around Kherson? Why was the capital city taken with hardly a shot being fired? More importantly, why were the withdrawing Russian forces not subjected to a merciless bombardment?\n\nTens of thousands of Russian troops crossing across the Dnipro through a small number of pontoon bridges would have been like sitting ducks for Ukrainian artillery and drones. Yet the withdrawal was carried out in good order and seemingly without significant loss of life.\n\nWas there a deal?\n\nNow the Ukrainians are belatedly trying their best to make this sound like a great victory. But reading between the lines (which one always had to do in this war), it is becoming clearer that the situation was not all that it seemed to be.\n\nGeneral Surovikin took one look at the map and immediately grasped the fact that, once the bridges across the Dnipro were down, the only real possibility open to him was to withdraw / Image: War Mapper\n\nThere are only two alternatives. Either the Ukrainian commanders are deaf, blind, dumb and very stupid (which we do not believe). Or else they had reached some kind of deal with the Russians. They would be allowed to take the city of Kherson without a bloody battle, on condition that they allowed the Russians free passage to the eastern shore with the bulk of their forces intact.\n\nSuch a suggestion may seem to come straight out of the cyberworld of the craziest conspiracy theories. But any student of military history will know that it has plenty of historical antecedents.\n\nIn the 18th century, there was no such thing as standing armies or conscription. The armies of the absolute monarchs of Europe were largely made up of mercenaries, recruited from different countries who fought for their pay. That meant that wars were a very expensive business.\n\nIn order to reduce the losses caused by deaths that all too often occur on battlefields, they invented the most ingenious schemes. On the eve of a battle, the two opposing generals would meet like proper gentlemen and discuss the disposition of their armies.\n\nFollowing the accepted rules of warfare, as one would study a chess board, they would conclude that one side clearly had the advantage and therefore would be entitled to declare victory. The other side would gracefully concur and the whole matter would be settled amicably, without the expense and unpleasantness of fighting.\n\nThese methods were finally shattered by the French Revolution, which fought wars by revolutionary means, mobilising the entire male population through what was called the Leve en masse (mass levy).\n\nThe mass of raw soldiers went into battle without any of the necessary military training, but fired by the ideals of the Revolution. These bare-footed sans-culottes threw themselves against the professional soldiers with no fear of losing their lives. The armies of Austria and Prussia had never seen anything like it and fled in terror. Such is the power of the revolutionary people.\n\nThe French Revolution changed the face of Europe in many ways. It also changed the nature of war itself. Beginning with Prussia, every European state was compelled to introduce conscription, following the French example, but of course, without any of its revolutionary content. The new way of war was seen in all its bloody reality in two world wars. But the Kherson business suggests that the old ways of the 18th century have not died out altogether\n\nGeneral Surovikin took one look at the map and immediately grasped the fact that, once the bridges across the Dnipro were down, the only real possibility open to him was to withdraw from a place that could not be supplied and retreat to the safety of the east bank.\n\nThe successful movement of several thousand Russian troops across the Dnipro without significant loss of life or equipment provides powerful confirmation to the Russian version that the withdrawal from Kherson city was a tactical manoeuvre, aimed at avoiding a catastrophic defeat.\n\nThis decision was forced upon them by the unfavourable circumstances already commented on. But it is the duty of a commander in the field to take account of such changes and act accordingly, which is what Surovikin did. There was absolutely nothing reprehensible about it from a strictly military point of view.\n\nThe complaints from the ultra-nationalist wing in Moscow merely show how far removed these gentlemen are from the realities of war. Even more ridiculous were the statements made by Medvedev and others to the effect that \"nothing has changed\" and Kherson remains within Russia.\n\nThat is clearly false. From the point of view of the Russian campaign, the value of the bridgehead on the west bank of the Dnipro was mainly as an advance position for an offensive on Mykolayiv and Odessa. Those plans have now been abandoned for the foreseeable future and any attempt to cross the river again will be much more difficult.\n\nPutin showed more sense than the others when he simply kept silent and slid quietly into the shadows, on the very sound principle that it is better to keep your mouth shut and let people think you are a fool than open it and let them know you are a fool.\n\nIn any case, the loss of Kherson is far from the end of the story and even if it causes some embarrassment to Putin, it will not do him any lasting damage.\n\nThe west is constantly harping on the theme of the imminent overthrow of Putin. But most people in Russia especially the working class believe (correctly) that this is a war of Russia against NATO and their hatred of US imperialism far outweighs any other consideration.\n\nThey will therefore continue to support Russias war and to tolerate Putins leadership until that becomes absolutely untenable. But that moment has not yet arrived.\n\nWhat has been achieved?\n\nThe question has to be asked: what has been achieved by the Russian withdrawal from Kherson? The Ukrainian army has been left in control of a largely deserted city, presumably full of mines and booby traps, while the Russian forces, by withdrawing to the other side of the Dnipro, have placed themselves in a strong defensive position.\n\nThe river Dnipro is itself a formidable barrier, which bars the eastward thrust of the Ukrainian forces. The surrounding area is mostly open ground with little or no cover for advancing troops to shelter from enemy fire. And the Russians have had plenty of time to fortify the eastern bank with concrete bunkers.\n\nThis means that the Ukrainians now have no realistic prospect of any further advance on the southern front. True, having come up to the Dnipro means that the supply lines into Crimea are now within the range of their artillery in the west bank. And true, they now have more troops which can be deployed elsewhere on the front line. There are reports that they are moving them to the Zaporizhzhia front where they might attempt to cut the Russian land corridor. It is impossible to verify these reports. But the Russians will also now have more troops free to defend the front wherever necessary.\n\nThe numbers of Russian soldiers mobilised continues to grow, and as winter grows closer, the frozen ground will make it possible to move their tanks into action. There is talk of a Russian winter offensive, which may not materialise. But it cannot be excluded.\n\nMeanwhile, constant air bombardment is destroying the Ukrainian infrastructure to the point that there is even talk of evacuating major cities including Kiev which the constant degradation of the infrastructure threatens to render uninhabitable.\n\nWashingtons response\n\nThe reality of the situation is not lost on serious military strategists in Washington. Speaking at an event at The Economic Club of New York, Joint Chiefs Chair general Mark Milley commented on the withdrawal of up to 30,000 Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro:\n\n\"I believe theyre doing it in order to preserve their force, to re-establish defensive lines south of the river, but that remains to be seen.\"\n\nBut Milley emphasised something else. He insisted that:\n\n\"[T]here may be a chance to negotiate an end to the conflict if and when the front lines stabilise during winter. When theres an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it. Seize the moment.\"\n\nThe generals enthusiasm for negotiations is no accident. It arises from his sober-minded appraisal of the real balance of forces:\n\n\"There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably in the true sense of the word may be not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Mark Milley's enthusiasm for negotiations is no accident. It arises from his sober-minded appraisal of the real balance of forces / Image: U.S. Secretary of Defense\n\nThis is the authentic voice of US imperialism. And this, not the rhetorical declarations of Zelensky, is what ultimately determines the fate of Ukraine.\n\nIn an even more significant development, The Wall Street Journal revealed that the Biden administration has refused to give Ukraine advanced drones that could target positions inside Russia.\n\nThe decision deprives Ukraine of the kind of advanced weaponry Kyiv has been requesting for months. Despite pleas from Kyiv and a bipartisan group of members of Congress, the Pentagon declined the request to provide the Gray Eagle MQ-1C drones which could negatively affect the extensive use by Russia of Iranian drones.\n\nThis was a clear reflection of the limit of the kinds of weaponry Washington is willing to provide for Ukraines defence. It was intended to send a signal to Moscow that the U.S. was unwilling to provide weapons that could escalate the conflict, creating the potential for a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO.\n\nIt was also a warning to Zelensky that there were definite limits to the willingness of the US to continue to foot the bill for a ruinously expensive war with no clear end in sight.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the Ukrainian President appealed for continued bipartisan support following the midterm elections. He is clearly a worried man and his worries are well founded.\n\n\"Politics by other means\"\n\nClausewitz pointed out long ago that war is only the continuation of politics by other means. The present war will end when the political ends of the key players are satisfied or when one or both sides are exhausted and lose the will to continue fighting.\n\nZelensky will, he says, settle for nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian army / Image: (C) Ukraine Presidency/Ukraine Presi/Planet Pix via ZUMA Press Wire\n\nWhat are these goals? The war aims of Zelensky are no secret. He will, he says, settle for nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian army from all Ukrainian lands including Crimea. He has said he will refuse to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. He even signed a decree specifying that Ukraine would only negotiate with a Russian president who has succeeded Putin. But that assumes rather optimistically that there is someone else he could negotiate with.\n\nThis standpoint is enthusiastically supported by the hawks in the western coalition: the Poles, the leaders of the Baltic States, who have their own interests in mind, and, of course, the wooden-headed chauvinists and warmongers in London, who imagine that Britain, even in its present state of economic, political and moral bankruptcy, is still an imperial power.\n\nThese deranged ladies and gentlemen are pushing the Ukrainians to go further much further than the Americans would like. Their most ardent desire is to see the Ukrainian army driving the Russians, not just from Donbas, but also Crimea, provoking the overthrow of Putin and the total defeat and (though they do not often speak of this in public) the complete dismemberment of the Russian Federation.\n\nBut the more sober-minded strategists of US imperialism know that all this delirium is just so much hot air, like the bullfrog in Aesops fable, who blew himself up to the point where he simply exploded. It is the stuff of dreams and has absolutely nothing in common with the real world.\n\nAlthough they make a lot of noise, no serious person pays the slightest attention to the antics of the politicians in London, Warsaw and Vilnius. As leaders of pygmy states that lack any real weight in the scales of international politics, they remain second-rate actors who can never play more than a minor supporting role in this great drama.\n\nIn fact, all the noise they make is merely an annoying distraction for US imperialism, for it is the USA that pays the bills and dictates everything that happens.\n\nThe war aims of US imperialism\n\nIn reality, the war aims of Washington do not coincide with those of the men in Kyiv, who long ago surrendered their so-called national sovereignty to their Boss on the other side of the Atlantic, and who no longer decide anything.\n\nThe goal of US imperialism is very simple: to weaken Russia / Image: NATO\n\nThe goal of US imperialism is not and never has been to defend a single inch of Ukrainian territory or help the Ukrainians win a war or in any other way.\n\nTheir real aim is very simple: to weaken Russia militarily and economically; to bleed it dry and to inflict harm on it; to kill its soldiers and ruin its economy, so that Russia will no longer offer any resistance to American domination of Europe and the world.\n\nIt was this aim that induced them to push the Ukrainians into an entirely unnecessary conflict with Russia over NATO membership. Having achieved this aim, they sat back and watched the spectacle of the two sides slugging it out, at a safe distance of several thousand miles.\n\nThey are entirely indifferent to the sufferings of the people of Ukraine, who they regard as mere pawns on the local chessboard of their power struggle with Russia. And it must be noted that, up to the present day, Ukraine has not been admitted to NATO membership, which was supposed to be the central business in the whole affair.\n\nThis is no accident. The present conflict suits Americas interests in many ways. They have the luxury of embroiling their enemy in a war in which no American soldiers are involved (at least, in theory), and all the fighting and dying is obligingly carried out by others.\n\nIf Ukraine was a member of NATO, this would mean that American combat troops would end up in a European war, fighting the Russian army, which possesses nuclear weapons. No. Far better to leave things as they are.\n\nWhen Zelensky complains that his western allies are not sending him all the arms he needs to win the war, he is not wrong. The Americans are sending him just enough arms to keep the war going, but not enough to score anything that resembles a decisive victory that could escalate into a direct conflict between Russia and NATO. But this is completely in line with Americas war aims.\n\nSanctions have failed\n\nOne important factor is the effects of the war on the world economy and the threat to social and political stability in the west that derives from it.\n\nThe sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine have been a spectacular failure. In fact, the value of Russian exports actually grew since the start of the war.\n\nAlthough the volume of Russias imports plunged as a result of sanctions, a number of countries have increased their trade with Russia. According to a detailed study by The New York Times imports from Turkey have increased by 113 percent, and Chinese imports by 24 percent.\n\nThe volume of trade with Russia after the start of the war was as follows:\n\nBritain: -76%\n\nSweden: -76%\n\nUSA: -35%\n\nGermany: -3%\n\nJapan: +13%\n\nSouth Korea: +17%\n\nNetherlands: +32%\n\nSpain: +57%\n\nChina: +64%\n\nBelgium: +81%\n\nBrazil: +106%\n\nTurkey: +198%\n\nIndia: + 310%\n\nMoreover, the high prices of oil and gas have offset revenue that Russia lost to sanctions. India and China have been buying much more of its crude, albeit at a discounted rate.\n\nThus, the lost income resulting from sanctions has been compensated by the rising price of oil and gas on world markets. Vladimir Putin continues to finance his armies with the proceeds, while the West is faced with the prospect of a freezing winter with soaring energy bills and rising public anger.\n\nSupport weakening\n\nThe question is: which side will tire of the war first? It is clear that time is not on the side of Ukraine, either from a military or a political point of view. And in the final analysis, the latter will weigh most heavily in the scales.\n\nWashington has been putting pressure on Zelensky to negotiate with Putin / Image: U.S. Department of State\n\nAs winter sets in and Europe is hit by a serious shortage of gas and electricity, public support for the war in Ukraine will weaken.\n\nNor can US support be taken for granted. In public, the Americans are keeping up the idea of their unshakable support for Ukraine, but in private, they are not at all convinced about the outcome.\n\nBehind the scenes, Washington has been putting pressure on Zelensky to negotiate with Putin. That was shown by Blinkens surprise visit to Kyiv in September and the more recent visit by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in November. But the strategists of US imperialism are very unsure how to proceed.\n\nThe Americans saw the Ukrainian advances on the battlefield (won mainly as a result of the active involvement of US imperialism) merely as a bargaining chip, designed to give the Ukrainians greater leverage at the negotiating table.\n\nIn practice, however, the successful Kharkiv offensive and the Russian withdrawal from Kherson has complicated the state of play on the diplomatic chess board. On the one hand, Zelensky and his generals were puffed up with their unexpected gains and wished to go much further.\n\nOn the other hand, the military setbacks represented a humiliating blow for Putin, who has drawn the conclusion that he needs to step up his \"special military operation\". Thus, neither side is in a mood to negotiate anything meaningful at present. But that will change.\n\nZelenskys demagogy, constantly insisting that they will never give up an inch of land, is clearly designed to put pressure on NATO and US imperialism by showing that the Ukrainians will fight to the end, always on condition that the West continues to send huge amounts of money and arms.\n\nBut the polls show that public support for the war in Ukraine is rapidly evaporating, as the New York Times already pointed out on 19 May 2022:\n\n\"Americans have been galvanized by Ukraines suffering, but popular support for a war far from U.S. shores will not continue indefinitely. Inflation is a much bigger issue for American voters than Ukraine, and the disruptions to global food and energy markets are likely to intensify.\" () \"But as the war continues, Mr. Biden should also make clear to President Volodymyr Zelensky and his people that there is a limit to how far the United States and NATO will go to confront Russia, and limits to the arms, money and political support they can muster.\"\n\nAnd as Business Insider reported on 27 September 2022:\n\n\"A new poll suggests that many Americans are growing weary as the US government continues its support of Ukraine in its war with Russia and want to see diplomatic efforts to end the war if aid is to continue. \"According to a poll conducted by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and Data for Progress, 57% of likely voters strongly or somewhat support the US pursuing diplomatic negotiations as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, even if it requires Ukraine making compromises with Russia.\"\n\nNuclear war?\n\nBiden would like to prolong the present conflict in order to weaken and undermine Russia. But not at any price, and certainly not if that involves a direct military clash with Russia.\n\nSpeaking about Putin, Biden invoked the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 / Image: James Vaughan Flickr\n\nPutins hint that he might consider using nuclear weapons was almost certainly a bluff, but it caused alarm in the White House. Speaking at a fundraiser in New York, Biden said Russias president was \"not joking\" about the \"potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming\".\n\n\"We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since [President John] Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,\" Biden said, adding that \"we have a direct threat of the use of nuclear weapons if in fact things continue down the path they are going\".\n\nThe Financial Times understands that secret negotiations are taking place between Washington and Moscow:\n\n\"President Joe Bidens sobering remarks about the threat of the use of nuclear weapons show that the White House is clear-eyed about the risk of escalation. For understandable reasons, Washington wants to maintain strategic ambiguity in public while communicating its views to the Kremlin in private. \"However, attempts to use a combination of new sanctions, more diplomatic isolation and possibly conventional NATO strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine to deter a desperate Putin from using weapons of mass destruction, should he feel cornered, are by no means guaranteed to succeed. To improve the chances of preventing a showdown, the quiet groundwork for crisis diplomacy should be laid now.\"\n\nDespite all the noise about Putin planning to use nuclear weapons, there are no credible reports to suggest that this is the case. He has no need for such weapons. On the Russian side, this is evidently a bluff (and one that has had some effect).\n\nBut the Russians have accused the Ukrainians of preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\", that is, conventional explosives laced with radioactive material.\n\nThis may be true or just part of the propaganda war. But it is very clear that the Ukrainian side is getting increasingly desperate and looking for any excuse to stage a provocation that they hope will finally drag NATO into direct participation in the war. It is not at all excluded that the Russian claim may be true.\n\nThis underlines the dangers that are implicit if the war is allowed to continue. There are too many uncontrollable elements in play, which might give rise to the kind of downward spiral that could lead to a real war between NATO and Russia.\n\nIn the event of a general European conflagration, it would be impossible for the Americans to stand on the sidelines, warming their hands on the flames. There would have to be American troops on the ground. But that was not supposed to be part of the script!\n\nBiden has said he was trying to find a way for Putin to back down. \"Im trying to figure out: what is Putins off-ramp?\" Biden said. \"Where does he find a way out?\"\n\nIn other words, it is Joe Biden who is now looking for a way out. But that is easier said than done.\n\nTo negotiate or not negotiate?\n\nIn the first month of the war, Ukraine and Russia held talks in which Ukraine promised it would remain neutral in exchange for the return of its territories.\n\nBut Russia called for Ukraine to recognise its annexed territories and the \"demilitarisation\" and \"denazification\" of Ukraine terms that Ukraine and its western allies refused to consider.\n\nAs noted, since then, Zelensky has said Ukraine is only prepared to enter negotiations with Russia (though not with Putin) if its troops leave all parts of the country, including Crimea and the eastern areas of the Donbas, de facto controlled by Russia since 2014, and if those Russians who have committed crimes in Ukraine face trial.\n\nBut these declarations have caused much irritation in Washington and beyond. The Washington Post revealed that US officials have warned the Ukrainian government in private that \"Ukraine fatigue\" among allies could worsen if Kyiv continues to refuse to negotiate with Putin.\n\nWhile the US has so far given Ukraine $18.9bn (16.6bn) worth of aid and says it will support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", allies in parts of Europe, not to speak of Africa and Latin America, are concerned by the strain that the war is putting on energy and food prices as well as supply chains.\n\nFor the Ukrainians, acceptance of the US request to negotiate would mean a humiliating retreat after so many months of belligerent rhetoric about the need for a decisive military defeat against Russia in order to secure Ukraines security in the long term.\n\nIs Putin in danger of overthrow?\n\nThe western propaganda is mere wish-fulfilment. It is based on a fundamental misconception. Putin has huge support and this has risen to new levels in recent months. He is not in any immediate danger of overthrow.\n\nPutin is not in any immediate danger of overthrow / Image: gov.ru\n\nThere is no significant anti-war movement in Russia and what little exists is led and directed by the bourgeois-liberal elements. That is precisely its main weakness. The workers take one look at the pro-western credentials of these elements, and turn away, cursing.\n\nThe only pressure on Putin comes, not from any anti-war movement, but on the contrary, from the Russian nationalists and others who want the war to be pursued with greater force and determination.\n\nAs for Russia, at the moment the war has the support of the majority, even if some have doubts. The imposition of sanctions and the constant stream of anti-Russian propaganda in the West, the fact that NATO and the Americans are supplying modern weapons to Ukraine, confirms the suspicion that Russia is being besieged by its enemies.\n\nThe weakness (more correctly, the absence) of the anti-war movement has already been commented on. However, if the war drags on for any length of time without significant proof of a Russian military success, that can change.\n\nIn early November more than 100 conscripts from Russias Chuvash Republic organised a protest in Ulyanov Oblast because they had not received payments promised by the Russian president.\n\nThe protesters were quickly \"pacified\" by riot police and Russian National Guard officers. But the rebellious mood of the troops was an ominous symptom for the authorities. The video of the disturbance included such comments as:\n\n\"Were risking our own lives and going to certain death for the sake of your security and peace. Our government is refusing to pay us the 195,000 roubles that President Vladimir Putin promised us! So why should we go to war for this state, leaving our families without support? \"We refuse to take part in the special military operation and will seek justice until were paid the money that was promised to us by the government led by the President of the Russian Federation!\"\n\nA small symptom, no doubt. But if the present conflict is prolonged, it could be multiplied on a far-bigger scale, posing a threat, not just to the war, but to the regime itself.\n\nThe most significant symptom is the protests of the mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine. These are still small in size and mainly concentrated in the Caucasian Republics like Dagestan, where high levels of unemployment meant that large numbers of young men volunteered for the army.\n\nIf the war continues and the number of deaths increase, we may see protests of mothers in Moscow and Petersburg, which Putin cannot ignore and will be unable to repress. This would undoubtedly mark a change in the whole situation. But it has not materialised yet.\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe war in Ukraine has now become an important factor in world perspectives. However, there are so many variables in this equation that it is impossible to predict accurately the outcome of this war. Nor is it possible to determine with any degree of accuracy how long it may last.\n\nWar is a moving picture with many unforeseeable variants. Napoleons saying that war is the most complex of all equations retains its full force.\n\nThe variant that has been confidently advanced by the western propaganda machine ever since the commencement of hostilities appeared to be validated by the success of the Ukrainian offensive in September, and now by the Russian withdrawal from the western part of Kherson.\n\nHowever, we must guard against impressionistic conclusions drawn from a limited number of events. The outcome of wars is rarely decided by a single battle or even by several battles. The question is: did this victory, or that advance, materially alter the underlying balance of forces, which alone can determine the final result?\n\nThus far, the Ukrainians have shown a remarkable level of resilience. But how long the morale of both the civilian population and the soldiers at the front can be maintained is unclear.\n\nMore importantly, how long will America and the West be prepared to spend vast amounts of money on a war that appears to have no clear end in sight, and which is placing intolerable strains on the world economy, driving social contradictions to the limit and testing political stability to breaking point.\n\nThese fundamental questions have yet to be determined. Time will tell which link in the chain will break first. For the time being, the bloody conflict will grind on, bringing untold misery to millions of people.",

                "cc_text": "Known loosely as the Mariupol plan, after the strategically vital port city, it called for the creation of an autonomous republic in Ukraines east, giving Putin effective control of the countrys industrial heartland, where Kremlin-armed, -funded and -directed \"separatists\" were waging a two-year-old shadow war that had left nearly 10,000 dead. The new republics leader would be none other than Yanukovych. The trade-off: \"peace\" for a broken and subservient Ukraine.\n\nThe scheme cut against decades of American policy promoting a free and united Ukraine, and a President Clinton would no doubt maintain, or perhaps even harden, that stance. But Trump was already suggesting that he would upend the diplomatic status quo; if elected, Kilimnik believed, Trump could help make the Mariupol plan a reality. First, though, he would have to win, an unlikely proposition at best. Which brought the men to the second prong of their agenda that evening internal campaign polling data tracing a path through battleground states to victory. Manaforts sharing of that information the \"eyes only\" code guiding Trumps strategy would have been unremarkable if not for one important piece of Kilimniks biography: He was not simply a colleague; he was, U.S. officials would later assert, a Russian agent.\n\nTheir business concluded, the men left by separate routes to avoid detection, though they continued to text deep into the night, according to federal investigators. In the weeks that followed, operatives in Moscow and St. Petersburg would intensify their hacking and disinformation campaign to damage Clinton and help turn the election toward Trump, which would form the core of the scandal known as Russiagate. The Mariupol plan would become a footnote, all but forgotten. But what the plan offered on paper is essentially what Putin on the dangerous defensive after a raft of strategic miscalculations and mounting battlefield losses is now trying to seize through sham referendums and illegal annexation. And Mariupol is shorthand for the horrors of his war, an occupied city in ruins after months of siege, its hulking steelworks spectral and silenced, countless citizens buried in mass graves.\n\nPutins assault on Ukraine and his attack on American democracy have until now been treated largely as two distinct story lines. Across the intervening years, Russias election meddling has been viewed essentially as a closed chapter in Americas political history a perilous moment in which a foreign leader sought to set the United States against itself by exploiting and exacerbating its political divides.\n\nYet those two narratives came together that summer night at the Grand Havana Room. And the lesson of that meeting is that Putins American adventure might be best understood as advance payment for a geopolitical grail closer to home: a vassal Ukrainian state. Thrumming beneath the whole election saga was another story about Ukraines efforts to establish a modern democracy and, as a result, its position as a hot zone of the new Cold War between Russia and the West, autocracy and democracy. To a remarkable degree, the long struggle for Ukraine was a bass note to the upheavals and scandals of the Trump years, from the earliest days of the 2016 campaign and then the presidential transition, through Trumps first impeachment and into the final days of the 2020 election. Even now, some influential voices in American politics, mostly but not entirely on the right, are suggesting that Ukraine make concessions of sovereignty similar to those contained in Kilimniks plan, which the nations leaders categorically reject.",

Those who remain regularly take cover as the crump of shelling echoes through the village.\n\n\"The winter starts and it is very cold and so we try to support the people with warm shoes and food what they need,\" said Benjamin, a German volunteer among aid workers who are helping residents prepare for winter.\n\n4:10 p.m.: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said another meeting on Sweden's NATO membership bid would be held later this month after hosting Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in Ankara on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nKristersson was hoping to persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Sweden joining the U.S.-led military alliance, with Ankara accusing Stockholm and Finland of harboring outlawed Kurdish militants.\n\nAfter meeting Kristersson at the presidential palace in the Turkish capital, Erdogan said a joint meeting would be organized in Stockholm later this month, without specifying the date.\n\n3:18 p.m.:\n\n2:30 p.m.: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Ankara conveyed its expectation to see concrete steps from Sweden to fulfil anti-terrorism obligations under a deal clearing bids by the Nordic country and neighboring Finland to join NATO.\n\nIn a joint news conference after a meeting in Ankara, Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he understood Turkey's fight against terrorism and vowed to fulfill security commitments the Nordic country made to get Ankara's backing for its entry into NATO.\n\n\"In our meeting, we have openly shared our expectations for concrete steps regarding the implementation of the provisions in the memorandum,\" Erdogan said.\n\n2:05 p.m.:\n\n1:30 p.m.: Russia's invasion of Ukraine has distracted world governments from efforts to combat climate change, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video message played at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\n\"There can be no effective climate policy without the peace,\" he said, highlighting the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on global energy supplies, food prices and Ukraine's forests.\n\n\"This Russian war has brought about an energy crisis that has forced dozens of countries to resume coal-fired power generation in order to lower energy prices for their people ... to lower prices that are shockingly rising due to deliberate Russian actions.\"\n\n\"(It) brought an acute food crisis to the world, which hit worst those suffering the existing manifestations of climate change ... the Russian war destroyed 5 million acres of forests in Ukraine in less than six months,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n12:50 p.m.:\n\n12:25 p.m.: Satellite photos analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press show a rapid expansion of a cemetery in southern Ukraine in the months after Russian forces seized the port city of Mariupol.\n\nThe images from Planet Labs PBC highlight the changes in the cemetery in Staryi Krym, an occupied town located northwest of the city. Comparing images from March 24, when Mariupol was under attack by the Russians, to one taken October 14, months after the citys fall, shows significant growth to the cemeterys southern fringes.\n\nAn area of some 1.1 square kilometers (less than half a square mile) appears to have been freshly dug over that period in the cemeterys southwestern corner. Another area of just over half a square kilometer was dug in the southeast corner.\n\nIt remains unclear how many people were buried in the cemetery during the roughly 7-month period.\n\nThe Center for Information Resilience, a London-based nonprofit that specializes in digital investigations and has monitored the Staryi Krym cemetery, estimated that more than 4,600 graves have been dug since the beginning of Russias war in Ukraine.\n\n11:40 a.m.:\n\n11:15 a.m.: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Tuesday he saw no need at present to evacuate Kyiv or any other cities that are not near the front lines in the war against Russia, Reuters reported.\n\nHe made his comments at a cabinet meeting following Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system, and after the mayor of Kyiv told residents to consider everything including a worst-case scenario where the capital loses power and water completely.\n\n\"Right now, the situation is far from (needing to) announce an evacuation,\" Shmyhal said. \"We must say that to announce the evacuation of any city not near the front lines, especially the capital, would not make any sense at present.\"\n\n10:30 a.m.:\n\n9:45 a.m.: The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, reassured Ukrainian farmers Tuesday that extending a wartime deal to facilitate Black Sea shipments of Ukrainian grain and other commodities is a priority for the U.N., The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe agreement, which Russia and Ukraine signed separately with the U.N. and Turkey, is set to expire on November 19. A Russian diplomat on Tuesday cited Moscows dissatisfaction with its implementation.\n\nSpeaking to farmers and reporters at a grain storage facility in Kyiv, Thomas-Greenfield said she saw Ukraine \"as the breadbasket of the world.\"\n\n\"This (war) really has had an impact on the entire global food market that you are not able to get your grains out,\" Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\nRussia briefly suspended its participation in the deal last week, alleging a Ukrainian drone attack on its Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Oct. 29. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nUkraine and Russia both are major global exporters of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other products, and the war has caused shortages and fueled worries of a hunger crisis in poorer nations.\n\n9:15 a.m.:\n\n9:05 a.m.: White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan has been engaged in confidential talks with senior Russian officials aimed at lowering the risk of a broader war over Ukraine, Reuters reported Tuesday, quoting a source familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe source, who asked to remain unidentified, said Monday that the talks are ongoing. The Sullivan talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSullivan said in September that the United States had communicated publicly and privately with the Russians about Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.\n\nWhile Sullivan had said publicly that there would be tragic consequences should Russia resort to nuclear weapons, it was unclear how this message was being communicated privately. The source said the talks had been taking place in recent months.\n\n8:50 a.m.: The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, is in Kyiv, Ukraine, to meet with government officials and humanitarian aid workers, VOAs U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer reported Tuesday.\n\nThomas-Greenfield said she was there \"to reiterate the United States unwavering support as Ukraine defends its freedom and territorial integrity amidst Russia's brutal and unprovoked invasion,\" according to a media statement released by her office.\n\nShe will discuss Americas commitment to Ukraines sovereignty, the Black Sea grain initiative aimed as easing the global food security crisis, and she will meet with humanitarian agencies working to support vulnerable Ukrainians impacted by the war, the statement said.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was due to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Tuesday, in a bid to persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Sweden joining NATO, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden and Finland abandoned their long-held policy of non-alignment and applied to join the military alliance. But Turkey has stalled ratification of their bids, accusing them of harboring outlawed Kurdish militants.\n\nErdogan who is seeking re-election next year is in a position of strength, having persuaded Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to stop blockading Ukraine's grain exports.\n\nHe and Kristersson were due to meet at the presidential palace at 14:15 GMT and then give a press conference. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg visited Ankara last week to press the countries' case.\n\n8:10 a.m.:\n\n8 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will take part in a summit of the Group of 20 major economies next week, most likely attending virtually, his spokesperson told the Suspilne public broadcaster on Tuesday.\n\nZelenskyy had said last week he would not take part if President Vladimir Putin attended the November 15 to16 summit in Indonesia. Serhiy Nykyforov, the spokesperson, did not say whether Zelenskyy had changed his position.\n\n7:45 a.m.:\n\n7:30 a.m.: Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said Tuesday that his country has started paying for some of the natural gas imported from Russia in roubles, Reuters reported.\n\nIn an interview with broadcaster TRT Haber, Donmez said that in the coming months the share of local currency payments in energy trade with Russia would increase.\n\nRussia, hit by Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, is increasingly asking buyers of its energy to pay in roubles to help bolster its currency. Most international energy deals are settled in U.S. dollars or euros. Turkey is also trying to boost trade using the lira, which has been hammered by unorthodox monetary policies.\n\nAnkara and Moscow agreed in September to start rouble payments for natural gas supplies.\n\nWhen asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a natural gas hub in Turkey, Donmez said Ankara would layout a roadmap by the end of this year and may hold a conference for suppliers and buyers.\n\n\"We could organize an international gas conference, perhaps in January or February, to bring together gas suppliers and importer countries to take their opinion, we will proceed according to that,\" Donmez said.\n\nLast month, Putin proposed Turkey as a base for gas supplies as an alternative route after the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged by blasts. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he agreed with the idea.\n\nThe European Union, which previously relied on Russia for about 40% of its gas needs, is seeking to wean itself off Russian energy following the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\n7:15 a.m.:\n\n7:05 a.m.: The U.S. Treasury and the State Department have tacitly asked major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup, not to refuse to cooperate with \"certain strategic Russian companies\" to minimize the adverse effects of sanctions, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nIn particular, officials urged banks not to refuse to provide \"basic services\" (money transfers and conversion into dollars) to companies that are not directly under sanctions, such as Gazprom, Uralkali, and PhosAgro.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly said it wants banks and businesses to keep the money flowing to non sanctioned sectors of Russia's economy. But the extent of its conversations with the banks hasn't been previously reported.\n\n6:50 a.m.: Kremlin-installed authorities in Ukraine's southern region of Kherson said Tuesday that power had been fully restored to its main city, after blaming Kyiv for attacks that disrupted water and electricity supplies, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nKherson city was the first urban hub to be captured by Russia after Moscow announced its \"special military operation\" in February and it has suffered outages after strikes Sunday for which Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame.\n\n\"There is electricity, despite sabotage and attacks,\" Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy head of the Kherson region said on social media Tuesday.\n\nUkraine troops have been pushing closer towards the city in recent months and its capture by Kyiv would be a significant defeat for Moscow.\n\n6:40 a.m.:\n\n6:30 a.m.: A senior Moldovan official said Tuesday that his government could sue Russian state energy company Gazprom over a sharp cut in natural gas supply and is studying its options, Reuters reported.\n\nThe small ex-Soviet state is reliant on Russian natural gas supplied by Gazprom and is grappling with a 40% cut in deliveries that has hurt its ability to supply enough electricity to its 2.5 million population.\n\n\"The lawyers are analyzing the possibility of applying sanctions for non-compliance with the contract on the issue of supplying the entire volume of gas,\" Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu told the PRO-TV television channel late on Monday.\n\n\"When it becomes clear, we will decide what actions to take and in what direction to act.\"\n\nMoldova, which has denounced the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, has a contract with Gazprom that fluctuates from month to month based on the spot market price of gas and oil.\n\n5:58 a.m.: German investigators are searching branches of Swiss bank UBS in Frankfurt and Munich in connection with a case involving Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing Spiegel weekly.\n\nThe searches were focused on gathering evidence related to a money-laundering case, Spiegel quoted a spokesperson for the attorney general's office as saying.\n\n5:28 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said he was open to talks with Russia, but only \"genuine\" negotiations that would restore Ukraine's borders, grant it compensation for Russian attacks and punish those responsible for war crimes.\n\n5 a.m.: The secretary of Ukraine's Security Council said on Tuesday the \"main condition\" for the resumption of negotiations with Russia would be the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nThe powerful official, Oleksiy Danilov, said on Twitter that Ukraine also needed the \"guarantee\" of modern air defenses, aircraft, tanks and long-range missiles\n\n4:28 a.m.:\n\n4 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin will join next week's G-20 leaders summit \"if the situation is possible,\" his Indonesian counterpart and the meeting's host said on Tuesday, adding that Putin could attend virtually instead.\n\nJoko Widodo, who is this year's chair of the bloc of major economies, said Putin during a phone conversation last week had not ruled out attending the summit in Bali, and would join if possible, Reuters reported.\n\n\"But if not ... maybe he'll ask to do it virtually,\" Jokowi, as the Indonesian president is popularly known, told reporters during a visit to Bali. He did not elaborate.\n\nThe Financial Times newspaper earlier quoted Jokowi as saying that his conversation with Putin had left him with a \"strong impression\" he would not attend. The Bali meeting is expected to be dominated by tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a \"special operation.\"\n\nThe Indonesian foreign ministry and presidential palace did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.\n\nAs G-20 host, Indonesia has resisted pressure from Western countries and Ukraine to disinvite Putin from the leaders summit and expel Russia from the group, saying it does not have the authority to do so without consensus among members. Jokowi in an interview with the Financial Times said Russia was welcome at the summit, which he feared would be overshadowed by a \"very worrying\" rise in international tensions.\n\n\"The G-20 is not meant to be a political forum. It's meant to be about economics and development,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nIndonesia has also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy, who has said he would not take part if Putin does. Several other world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, are expected to attend.\n\n3:40 a.m.:\n\n2:25 a.m.: Chinese authorities behind a major trade expo in Shanghai pulled an opening ceremony address by the European Council president that was set to criticize Russia's \"illegal war\" in Ukraine and call for reduced trade dependency on China, diplomats said.\n\nThe pre-recorded video by Charles Michel was meant to be one of several from world leaders and heads of international organizations including Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening of the China International Import Expo (CIIE) on Friday, three European diplomats told Reuters.\n\nThe diplomats, who cannot be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters they were surprised the speech was removed.\n\n\"President Michel was invited to address 5th Hongqiao Forum/CIIE in Shanghai,\" Barend Leyts, a spokesman for Michel told Reuters. \"As requested by the Chinese authorities, we had indeed provided a pre-recorded message which was ultimately not shown. We have addressed this through the normal diplomatic channels.\"\n\nNo one from China's foreign ministry or the co-organizers of the expo, China's commerce ministry and the Shanghai city government, responded to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n2:00 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.: Russia and the United States are discussing holding talks on strategic nuclear weapons for the first time since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing Russian newspaper Kommersant which quoted four sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nTalks between the two sides on strategic stability have been frozen since Russia began its military campaign in Ukraine on February 24, even as the New START treaty on nuclear arms reduction stays in effect.\n\nThe talks may take place in the Middle East, the paper said, adding that Moscow no longer saw Switzerland, the traditional venue, as sufficiently neutral after it imposed sanctions on Russia over Ukraine.\n\n12:52 a.m.: For much of the past month, Russian strikes have heavily targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, severely damaging the electricity network.\n\nTo ease the strain on the grid and avoid a total blackout, national energy operator Ukrenergo has imposed controlled power cuts in the capital and elsewhere across the war-torn country.\n\nResidents can consult the official schedule for rolling blackouts to pinpoint exactly when their lights will go out.\n\nThe buildings in the neighborhood in northern Kyiv experienced three four-hour power cuts on Saturday from midnight to 4:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and again from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Residents who spoke to Agence France-Presse describe the daily struggles as Kyiv adapts to blackouts.\n\n12:02 a.m.: North Korea denied American claims it's shipping artillery shells and ammunition to Russia for use in its war against the Ukraine, and on Tuesday accused the United States of lying, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe denial came in the wake of dozens of weapons tests by North Korea, including nuclear capable missiles with the ability to strike the continental United States. It said it was testing the missiles and artillery so it could \"mercilessly\" strike key South Korean and U.S. targets if it chooses to. U.S. officials recently confirmed a U.S. intelligence finding that Russia was in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

Experts are continuously present at the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, which has been under Russian military occupation since March.\n\n\"From the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the IAEA has been doing everything it can to prevent a nuclear accident with potentially serious consequences for public health and the environment,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement.\n\n\"Immediately after I received this latest request from Ukraine, we developed concrete proposals and began preparing the technical and logistical details and we are now ready to deploy these new missions soon,\" he said. \"While the world is focused on the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, we must not forget the other nuclear facilities located in a country at war.\"\n\nEach mission should last for about a week, according to Grossi, but more may follow if needed.\n\nThe IAEA has regularly carried out safeguard activities in these facilities.

                "cc_text": "Several Delegates Underline Need to Review Sanctions Regime, Mission Mandates\n\nUrging support for regional organizations and sustainable financing to counter terrorism in Africa, the Deputy Secretary-General stressed that the spread of terrorism is a concern for the entire international community and requires a preventive approach that includes respect for human rights and international law, as the Security Council held a high-level debate on counter-terrorism in Africa today.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, Amina Mohammed emphasized that nowhere has terrorism been felt more keenly than in Africa, underscoring that terrorists and violent extremists, including Daesh, Al-Qaida and their affiliates have exploited instability and conflict to increase their activities and intensify attacks across the continent.\n\n\"In todays hyperconnected world, the spread of terrorism in Africa is not a concern for African Member States alone. The challenge belongs to us all,\" she underscored. Countering international terrorism requires effective multilateral responses that address concurrent and converging threats, such as the worsening climate crisis, armed conflict, poverty and inequality, lawless cyberspace and the uneven recovery from COVID-19.\n\n\"We must strike a better balance and ensure coherence and complementarity between preventive and militarized responses,\" she said, highlighting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Unions Agenda 2063 as crucial tools. The numerous regional initiatives to counter terrorism in Africa, including the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin and the joint force of the Group of 5 for the Sahel (G5 Sahel), need the international communitys full support and durable commitment. The Security Council must ensure predictable funding for African Union operations it authorizes, including to counter-terrorism, she urged.\n\nMoussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, said African initiatives, such as the Accra Initiative and the Peace Fund, demonstrate that the continent can mobilize its resources and its men and women in the fight against terrorism. However, the traditional means of responding to threats to peace, peacekeeping and peacebuilding no longer correspond to new menaces. The mandates of United Nations missions should be revised to make them more effective. The Union stands ready to work with the United Nations and the Council to initiate a new approach to counter the scourge, and its direct and indirect causes, he said.\n\nBenedikta Von Seherr-Thoss, Managing Director for Common Security and Defence Policy and Crisis Response, European External Action Service, said that in September, the European Union assumed the role of co-chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and made the threat of terrorism in Africa a key priority for its two-year tenure. Detailing the European Unions various counter-terrorism efforts, she stressed that women and girls must be actively included in the international communitys prevention approach. Empowering them to be active members of society will make them, and their societies, more resistant to extremist influences in the long run.\n\nComfort Ero, President and CEO of the International Crisis Group, warned that conflicts involving non-State armed groups including jihadist groups will be a source of instability in Africa for a while. Although African-led missions are well positioned to counter such threats, they can only be effective if they are properly and reliably resourced. A political strategy for counter-terrorism missions must also encompass projects to provide basic services and better governance in areas where non-State armed groups have gained influence. Moreover, stakeholders must contemplate engaging in dialogue with non-State armed groups often seen as a taboo to resolve both humanitarian and political issues.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, many Council members underscored the crucial need to address the drivers of instability and adopt a preventive, holistic and inclusive approach to counter terrorism in Africa. Several speakers called for the international communitys strengthened support to regional organizations and initiatives, while others urged sustainable funding for African-led operations. Delegates also pointed to the need to review the sanctions regime and United Nations mission mandates.\n\nNana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, which holds the Security Council presidency for November, speaking in his national capacity, stressed that international support to countering terrorism must be pre-emptive, rather than reactive. The Council and the wider international community must address the underlying drivers of instability through resilience-building in conflict prone regions, including in the areas of promoting democratic values, development and State services.\n\nGabons representative, on that point, called for a more urgent response from the international community to support Africas own multiplying regional counter-terrorism initiatives, including the G5 Sahel, the Accra Initiative and the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Such support must be lent through adequate financial, logistical and material means, while also helping to dry up the sources of financing of terrorist groups.\n\nKenyas representative, in a similar vein, stressed the need for adequate and predictable funding, including through United Nations-assessed contributions. As well, the Council must review the sanctions regime for Somalia to ensure that the Government is empowered to use its full sovereign will to defeat Al-Qaida and Daesh affiliates in its territory, while tightening sanctions that are most clearly targeted at those groups ability to raise and send funds, assemble explosives, and recruit and transport foreign fighters.\n\nIrelands representative also emphasized that Council-mandated measures to counter terrorism, including sanctions, are crucial to deter and address terrorist threats, but can have unintended negative humanitarian impacts. To address this, his country, together with the United States, introduced a draft resolution providing for a humanitarian exemption across all sanctions regimes, he said, urging all Council members to support that initiative.\n\nChinas representative said that supporting Africa in combating terrorism is an important responsibility of the Council, which must prioritize resources to help the continent address the most pressing challenges it faces. He called for countries sovereignty to be fully respected and for no other political conditions to be attached to support. In this regard, the arms embargo against Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have had a negative impact and must be adjusted or lifted.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation said the necessary counter-terrorism mechanisms have already been developed within the United Nations, primarily in the Council. States have specific obligations to counter terrorism, which if strictly implemented, will produce the desired results. It is not productive to impose additional counter-terrorism obligations on United Nations missions in Africa. Such an expansion of their mandate is not in line with the specific nature of the Organizations presence and diverts valuable resources, he stressed.\n\nNorways representative said that United Nations missions in Africa are not set up to tackle the threat of terrorism due to various factors. However, such missions both peacekeeping and political are complementary to national and regional counter-terrorism efforts and can help contribute to stability and protecting civilians, evident in the partnerships between the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNISOM) and ATMIS.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of the United Arab Emirates, United States, Brazil, Mexico, India, Albania, France and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe meeting began at 10:14 a.m. and ended at 12:48 p.m.\n\nBriefings\n\nAMINA MOHAMMED, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, delivering remarks on behalf of the Secretary-General, said nowhere has terrorism a major threat to international peace and security been felt more keenly than in Africa. Terrorists and violent extremists including Daesh, Al-Qaida and their affiliates have exploited instability and conflict to increase their activities and intensify attacks across the continent, killing and wounding thousands. Many more continue to suffer from the broader impact of terrorism on their lives and livelihoods. Women and girls in particular bear the brunt of insecurity and inequality, she said, pointing out that some terrorist groups have a misogynist worldview that denies women and girls their fundamental rights. The situation in the Sahel and West Africa is particularly urgent, with some of the most violent Daesh affiliate operating in the region. In the last two years, these groups have increased their presence in Mali, penetrated further into Burkina Faso and Niger and expanded southward into countries of the Gulf of Guinea that have so far largely avoided terrorist attacks or have recently emerged from armed conflict. It can be difficult to differentiate between terrorists, non-State armed groups and criminal networks, she pointed out, noting that some have morphed into insurgencies occupying territories and posing as alternatives to State authority.\n\n\"In todays hyper-connected world, the spread of terrorism in Africa is not a concern for African Member States alone. The challenge belongs to us all,\" she underscored. Countering international terrorism requires effective multilateral responses that address it together with concurrent and converging threats, such as the worsening climate crisis, armed conflict, poverty and inequality, lawless cyberspace and the uneven recovery from COVID-19. The New Agenda for Peace envisaged as part of the Secretary-Generals report on Our Common Agenda will embrace that comprehensive approach, propose ways to address new and emerging risks and revitalize the collective peace and security system. In Africa, prevention remains the international communitys best response to terrorism, violent extremism and other threats to peace and security, she said, stressing the need to foster conflict-sensitive approaches and integrate relevant policies across United Nations entities. \"We must strike a better balance and ensure coherence and complementarity between preventive and militarized responses,\" she said, highlighting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Unions Agenda 2063 as crucial preventive tools.\n\n\"Everyone must be included,\" she said, underscoring the need for whole of-society approaches that are community-based and gender-sensitive. Engaging all sectors of society requires sustained political commitment across Government departments, and partnerships with civil society, the private sector and more. As well, countering terrorism can never be an excuse for violating human rights or international law, she said, stressing that successful counter-terrorism policies must uphold the rule of law and respect international law, including human rights law. The Secretary-Generals Call to Action for Human Rights places human rights at the centre of the work of the United Nations from humanitarian action to peace and security to sustainable development, she said, reiterating the Secretary-General's call for renewed efforts to promote State institutions and constitutional order.\n\nRegional organizations have a critical role, she continued, noting that the challenges posed by terrorist and violent extremist groups can only be met through approaches that are adapted to local contexts. The numerous regional initiatives to counter terrorism in Africa the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin, Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G5 Sahel), the Accra Initiative and the Nouakchott Process need the international communitys full support and durable commitment. The Security Council must ensure predictable funding for African Union operations it authorizes, including to counter terrorism, she urged, noting that the Organization is preparing a joint progress report on the financing of African Union peace operations, which is due in April 2023. \"We must put in place an innovative architecture that supports African peace operations in an effective and sustainable manner,\" she emphasized, stressing that the magnitude of the problem calls for bold investment. She added that the upcoming summit on counter-terrorism in Africa, organized jointly by the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and Nigeria to be held in October 2023, is an opportunity to consider ways to strengthen United Nations support to counter-terrorism efforts across the continent.\n\nMOUSSA FAKI MAHAMAT, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, briefing the Council via videoconference, said that, across Africa, from Mali to Mozambique, from Somalia to the Gulf of Guinea, the themes of peace and security torment, agitate and mobilize African minds. Even Europe has been plunged back into a devastating war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, resulting in consequences that risk pushing humanity into a new planetary tragedy. In Africa, terrorism and the increasing use of violence to gain power are fragmenting societies and causing death and psychological damage daily, as well as impacting the health, education and nutrition of populations. He called on the Council to consider such violence and its attendant miseries, as well as the failure of systems to address the scourge of terrorism, which is spreading across the continent.\n\n\"What has the international community, of which the Security Council is the lynchpin, done on issues of peace and security?\" he asked, adding that Africa is tired of hearing promises and deserves to benefit from the prompt concern shown by its partners in other places and in other circumstances. Against this backdrop, he spotlighted African initiatives to counter the phenomenon of terrorism and violent extremism. Such efforts include the Accra Initiative, whose objective is to promote the exchange of information and the conduct of joint cross-border military operations between its member States, as well as the G5 Sahel Joint Force, the Multinational Joint Force in Lake Chad and the recent regional force established in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The African Union has set up a Peace Fund to work towards prevention and support the efforts of countries that are victims of terrorist violence, he said, adding that such measures demonstrate that Africa is able to mobilize its resources, and its men and women, in the existential fight against terrorism.\n\nEfforts to tackle the scourge, however, must be supported through sustainable financial resources and technical and logistical support, he continued. In that regard, the terrorist threat has also lately been compounded by the spread of unconstitutional changes of Government, which present a deceptive illusion of salvation and result in governance practices that damage already weakened States. Commending Ghanian President Nana Akufo Ados commitment to democracy, as vividly demonstrated by his opposition to unconstitutional changes as President of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), he called for strengthened international solidarity with Africas fight against all the challenges it faces.\n\nSuch solidarity, however, would be futile unless it follows a new model, which is more dynamic, less bureaucratized, and more robust, he stressed. The traditional means of responding to threats to peace, peacekeeping and peacebuilding no longer correspond to new circumstances and new threats; their costs and modes of operations are frankly unsuitable, inefficient, and obsolete, he pointed out. There is an urgent need to revise the mandates of United Nations missions to make them more effective. The African Union stands ready to work with the United Nations and the Council to initiate a new approach to counter the scourge and its direct and indirect causes.\n\nBENEDIKTA VON SEHERR-THOSS, Managing Director for Common Security and Defence Policy and Crisis Response, European External Action Service , said the European Union-United Nations Global Terrorist Threat Facility is a good example of the strategic partnership between two organizations on peace operations and crisis management. In September, the European Union assumed the role of co-chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum and made the threat of terrorism in Africa a key priority for its two-year tenure. Highlighting multilateral engagement on the ground, she said several European Union missions currently provide military and civilian support to African countries. The latest is the European Training Mission in Mozambique, which was deployed last year to train and support the Mozambican Armed Forces, with a view to protecting civilians and restoring security in Cabo Delgado.\n\nShe went on to note that five of its civilian missions include a counter-terrorism mandate: the capacity-building missions in Niger, Mali and Somalia; the border assistance mission in Libya; and the security sector reform assistance mission in the Central African Republic. Her bloc continues to support African-led peace operations, she said, noting that earlier this year, it approved 600 million in assistance to the African Union through the European Peace Facility, its financial instrument aimed at preventing conflicts, building peace and strengthening international security.\n\nHowever, despite collective efforts to keep the threat of extremist groups at bay, this has not been enough, she emphasized, urging greater and better cooperation. The European Union plays a role in this by bringing 27 member States together, she said, affirming its strong commitment to work with African nations, the African Union, and with the United Nations to address the growing threat of terrorism and to bolster resilience to violent extremist ideologies. The blocs efforts in preventing and countering violent extremism, whether through addressing youth extremism in Kenya, or intercommunal conflict in Nigeria, have shown real results and will remain key to its counter-terrorism engagement. At present, the European Union provides around 500 million in support to related projects across the African continent, which strengthen local authorities, local communities and civil society actors alike.\n\nGood governance, including respect for the rule of law, human rights and the principles of democracy and international law, is also crucial to truly address the ideologies and driving forces behind emergent violent extremism, she continued. While that political question is primarily the responsibility of national leaders, it also requires the continued attention and, at times, action of the Security Council. Women and girls must be actively included in the international communitys prevention approach. Recognizing this and empowering them to be active members of society economically, politically, and culturally will make them, and their societies, more resistant to extremist influences in the long run. West Africa requires the international communitys immediate attention to stem the risks of spillover from advancing terrorist actors, she stressed, noting that the European Union is stepping up its security support to the Gulf of Guinea coastal countries through the \"Arc of Stability\" policy.\n\nCOMFORT ERO, President and CEO of the International Crisis Group , an international conflict prevention organization with a focus on Africa, said that the Crisis Group has published analyses of the African-led stabilization and counter-terrorism missions under discussion, including the G5 Sahel Joint Force and the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin, as well as one on the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Conflicts involving non-State armed groups including jihadist groups will be a source of instability in Africa for a while, and although African-led missions are well positioned to counter such threats, they can only be effective if they are properly and reliably resourced. \"Like it or not, the best way to resource these missions is through some sort of United Nations mechanism,\" she pointed out. Further, there is a role for the use of force against jihadists, but such operations must be subordinate to a political strategy that also encompasses projects to provide basic services and better governance in areas where non-State armed groups have gained influence. Moreover, such political strategy must contemplate engaging in dialogue with non-State armed groups often seen as a taboo to resolve both humanitarian and political issues.\n\nThere should be support for regionally-led stabilization operations to counter non-State armed groups in Africa, she continued, noting that the continent is now the centre of civil wars in the world. Although the Security Council has sent blue helmet peacekeepers as part of the response to such threats, including to Mali, such forces are not designed or equipped to fight extended counter-terrorism campaigns, as seen in Gao and Kidal. Against this backdrop, she reiterated the Crisis Groups call to the Council to do a serious stock-taking of whether forces, such as the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), are fit for purpose in such cases. On the other hand, she enumerated a number of successes spearheaded by African-led stabilization forces, including AMISOM, in the battle against Al-Shabaab, which paved the way for that countrys most recent successful electoral process.\n\n\"Yet one of the most serious headaches for missions of this type is donor fatigue,\" she observed, noting that African officials and military planners in the Sahel and Somalia are constrained from medium and long-term planning in their operations due to worries that partners who back their missions will keep providing the necessary financial and other resources they need to deliver on their mandate. Such concerns are also mirrored by those of donors, often but not only in North America and Europe. A Crisis Group examination of donor perceptions last year found that European donors appreciated the risks African troops took, but feared they were funding \"an expensive status quo\". \"So, it behoves the Council to ask how to offer missions authorized by the African Union more systematic and predictable funding, to allow them to plan, operate and deliver better,\" she emphasized.\n\nTo this end, she called for obstacles to establishing a solid mechanism for channelling United Nations funding to African-led operations be addressed, recalling the findings of a report published by her organization in 2020. That report found that cash is not the only issue. The United Nations and African Union still have a lot of work to do to define the rules that would govern the political oversight of future United Nations-funded African-led peace operations, the mechanisms for assessing their operational performance and accounting procedures to oversee their finances. \"Therefore, it is time for United Nations and African Union representatives to engage in a serious joint effort to work out answers to questions about how such funding will work,\" she emphasized.\n\nTurning to measures to complement such military operations, so they can defeat deeply entrenched, if not popular, movements, she called for steps to be taken to provide basic services as a crucial short-term counter-terrorism tool and to help win over populations in areas under the control of jihadists; strengthened governance, as a medium-term counter-terrorism tool; and dialogue, as part of the counter-terrorism toolkit. On this point, she noted that the Group has pushed governments in the Sahel to seek dialogue with armed groups that could encourage, for instance, local ceasefire accords that can ease the suffering in rural areas, open up space for the return of state services and allow residents to return to their homes and rebuild livelihoods. Crisis Group, therefore, encourages the Security Council to reinforce the United Nations mechanisms to support African-led missions to fight non-State armed groups, and also encourages the United Nations, African Union and other African actors to keep an open mind about talking to those groups, an approach, notably, that authorities in countries such as Niger have publicly adopted in recent months.\n\nStatements\n\nNANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO, President of Ghana , which holds the Security Council presidency for November, said it is important to leverage the role of the African Union and its regional economic commissions in raising a robust and resourced force to confront terrorists and other armed groups, alongside other peace operation initiatives. The Independent High-Level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, led by the former President of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou, must do so with the best elements of the G5 Sahel Joint Force, Accra Initiative, Nouakchott Process and the Multinational Joint Task Force, and consider recommendations for a unified and restructured regional force, he said, urging the Councils support of those efforts. The burden of confronting terrorism cannot be borne by those in the region alone, he added, stressing the need for strong collaboration between the United Nations, African Union and regional economic communities, especially ECOWAS, to address the question of adequate, predictable and sustainable financing for regional led operations. The African Union has demonstrated its commitment and capacity to effectively manage such financing and to comply with the required human rights standards in such operations. The Council and the wider international community must play their part, if there is a desire to have a continuing relevance.\n\nMoreover, the structure and approach of international support to countering terrorism, including in the Sahel, must be pre-emptive, rather than reactive, he continued. As such, the Council and the wider international community must address the underlying drivers of instability through resilience-building in conflict prone regions, including in the areas of promoting democratic values, development and State services. International support must be placed fully behind deliberate interventions to promote inclusive governance. Support was also crucial for effective State authority in several parts of the region in order to meet the expectations of its largely youthful populations, who, in some instances, have fallen victim to the radicalized messages of extremists. The Councils support for adequate, predictable and sustainable financing of African-led operations would be an important starting point if it is to continue to assume its responsibility as the primary actor for the maintenance of international peace and security. He urged Council members to revisit the vexed issue of the reform of the United Nations system, especially of the Security Council, and to do so on the basis of the African Common Position on United Nations Reform, as enunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus.\n\nHERMAN IMMONGAULT, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon , said terrorism and violent extremism pose a formidable transnational threat that no Government or organization can fight alone in many regions of the world. Since no country is safe from such threats, concerted action at national, regional and global levels is required against it, and it must be as multidimensional as the threat itself. Above all, it must be based on the foundation of a more assertive multilateralism, he stressed. Africa has become one of the main fronts in the fight against terrorism, which impedes development. African leaders have recognized the scale of the challenge and are committed to addressing it, as evinced by the adoption on 28 May in Malabo of a declaration condemning all forms and manifestations of extremist violence and their willingness to fight it on the continent. Such threats spare no African region, from the Sahel to the Lake Chad Basin, and from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, northern Mozambique and Somalia, leading to the loss of life, displacement and misery, he pointed out.\n\nThe scourge is also crippling the so-called tri-border area in the Sahel, which is now the epicentre of an asymmetric war whose end is nowhere in sight and strains the capabilities of national security forces and destabilizes entire regions, he continued. As well, new technologies are being used for propaganda, radicalizing new recruits and perpetrating fresh atrocities. In this regard, he called for a more urgent response from the international community to support Africas own multiplying regional counter-terrorism initiatives, including the G5 Sahel, the Accra Initiative, and the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Such support must be lent through adequate financial, logistical and material means, while also helping to dry up the sources of financing of terrorist groups. An effective fight against terrorism in Africa calls for a holistic approach that also addresses the socioeconomic challenges faced by affected countries. Further, he called for strengthened partnerships in cooperation and intelligence, including the identification and tracking of online sources of finance and monetary transactions, to curb illicit activities that fund terrorism. The Council must redouble its efforts to lend support to African peace support initiatives and operations, he stressed.\n\nSHAKHBOOT NAHYAN AL NAHYAN, Minister of State of the United Arab Emirates , said his country has strongly supported regional and international efforts, including through contributions to the G5 Sahel Joint Force and its membership in the Global Coalition against Daesh, and through the establishment of the Coalitions Africa Focus Group, which will work to counter the threat posed by Daesh across Africa. Offering recommendations for collective action, he stressed the need for an integrated approach, combining all the tools at the disposal of the international community in a way that addresses the local contexts. The extension and maintenance of State authority is key and can only be sustained in the long term through the provision of basic services and support for sustainable development. Such efforts enhance stability and weaken extremist actors abilities to exploit the grievances of affected populations as a tool to radicalize and recruit. Underscoring the importance of inclusive governance, he said cooperation with the local community leaders, including religious leaders, is critical as terrorist groups, such as Daesh, hijack the moral practices of religion, including the peaceful religion of Islam, to spread extremism and recruit fighters.\n\nWell-financed climate adaptation strategies are not just a moral imperative for all, but a security requirement to combat extremism in Africa and elsewhere, he continued. In addition, the frameworks built by the Security Council over the last two decades must be adjusted to ensure that they contain the right tools to address the threats of extremism and terrorism. Daesh, Al-Qaida, and their respective affiliates remain a clear threat to international peace and security. To keep pace with threats to international peace and security, the Council must consider the challenges arising from its counter-terrorism approach focused on Daesh and Al-Qaida to the exclusion of others. The international community must also delegitimize terrorist groups that claim to act in the name of religion or that suggest that they constitute a \"State\" or \"province\". As such, the international community must refrain from using the terms \"Islamic State\" or \"ISIL\" in reference to Daesh and its affiliates in coastal West Africa and the Sahel. \"We must deny terrorist groups their self-proclaimed connections to Islam,\" he stressed.\n\nELIZABETH SHERWOOD-RANDALL, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security of the United States , said that in the years since 11 September 2001, the threat of terrorism has evolved, becoming more ideologically diverse and geographically diffuse, adding: \"Nowhere is this more vivid than in Africa.\" She enumerated a number of places in the continent which face such threats, including in Burkina Faso, where farmers are displaced from their sole source of income; Mozambique, where ISIS-Mozambique lays siege to towns and has held people hostage; and in Somalia, where bombs recently led to the tragic deaths of 100 civilians, including educators. While counter-terrorism successes are hard-won and take place out of public view, unfortunately terrorist acts are far more visible, she said, citing figures that have found such violence to have increased in the continent by 300 per cent over the last decade. Such rising violence affects us all, she said, stressing the need for a collective response.\n\nShe went on to outline the United States efforts to address such threats, including by investing in governance and diplomacy, deepening ties with African partners and leveraging the strength of the international community. The United States follows an integrated strategy, which addresses the drivers of instability, and recognizes that counter-terrorism is not just about fighting terrorism, but also about offering economic opportunities that are more attractive to young recruits, and to build capacity to hold those responsible for acts of violence to account. To this end, she said she has travelled across the continent, from Djibouti to Somalia and Niger, and has witnessed firsthand the vital role played by local partners in addressing terrorist threats. With the substantial changes in such threats over the years, she underscored the need for collaboration, including through the strengthened use of the sanctions committee pursuant to Council resolution 1267 (1999) to induce a change in behavior, and through seeking the help of the Office of Counter-Terrorism to monitor threats. She looked forward to the findings of the joint strategic assessment of security and governance in the Sahel to help her country provide more effective support. Further, she underlined the need for respect for democracy for counter-terrorism efforts to succeed, warning that the activities of armed mercenary groups, such as the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, weaken the security environment, with civilians paying the price.\n\nMICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO ( Kenya ) said the Council must stand with Governments, as it is doing with Somalia, by mandating and deploying robust African forces assembled by the African Union and regional communities. Adequate and predictable funding, including through United Nations-assessed contributions, is also needed. The Council must review the sanctions regime for Somalia to ensure that the Government is empowered to use its full sovereign will to defeat the Al-Qaida and Daesh affiliates in its territory. Simultaneously, it must tighten the sanctions that are most clearly targeted at those groups ability to raise and send funds regionally and internationally, to assemble explosives, and to recruit and transport foreign fighters. The response in the Sahel, West Africa and the Great Lakes, by the Council and the international community, should be more alike to that in Somalia and Mozambique, he pointed out. States in the region must endeavour to undertake ambitious legal and political efforts to be inclusive based on religious, regional and ethnic identity. The Council must equally apply its counter-terrorism architecture against terrorist groups and their affiliates, particularly those in Africa, he said, stressing that the fight against global terrorism cannot and will not be won by applying double standards. This years twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties should lead to a recommitment by countries to meet their climate commitments and contribute to the development of climate-change affected countries in Africa, to deny terrorists the breeding ground to thrive, he said.\n\nRONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) said that the perception that terrorism is less menacing than it used to be is due to insufficient attention paid by the media to some parts of the world. However, the expansion of terrorism in Africa is a reality and seriously impacts the continents security. He emphasized the need for counter-terrorism efforts to be consistent with international law. United Nations peacekeeping operations help consolidate conditions for long-term stability and have an inhibiting effect on terrorism, while regional and subregional organizations efforts in containing its spread also deserve support. He went on to commend progress made by the African Union and regional organizations in countering terrorism, including by ATMIS in the Horn of Africa and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Mozambique, as well as the Accra Initiative, and expressed hope that the G5 Sahel will also overcome current challenges it faces. Turning to the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel and the expansion of terrorist acts towards the West African coast, he called on the international community to lend support to counter-terrorism initiatives in the region. Technical cooperation can help enhance national institutions capabilities in fighting terrorism, and steps must be taken towards tackling terrorisms root causes through development, he added.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said that while the deployment of military counter-terrorism operations in regions such as the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin or the Horn of Africa clearly shows that such efforts are important to halt the advance of extremist groups, such operations must have realistic and more specific objectives and, if possible, shorter time frames. Counter-terrorism forces that are prolonged over time lose effectiveness and can generate counter-reactions to their objectives; this leads to fatigue, both among donors and public opinion in the countries where they operate. Further, the concentration of resources in the security component can act to the detriment of the civil administration responsible for providing basic services. As such, military efforts should be framed within a broad political strategy, the main objective of which is to transform the conditions which foster the emergence of terrorism. Socioeconomic challenges linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and food and energy crises, as well as extreme weather events, threaten to exacerbate inequalities. Thus, it is urgent to strengthen social policies and prioritize peacebuilding actions to prevent the unfolding of an even greater security crisis. The Accra Initiative, G5 Sahel and the Nairobi Process are all examples of regional willingness to respond to the activity of terrorist groups and therefore deserve the full support of the international community. Terrorists must be prevented from accessing weapons, especially small arms and light weapons, by strengthening actions to counter their illicit trafficking, in accordance with resolution 2616 (2021).\n\nRUCHIRA KAMBOJ ( India ) said that even after the end of colonialism for several decades, many African countries continue to face serious security threats from terrorism, armed groups, transnational organized crime, and drugs and arms trafficking, which pose challenges to their socioeconomic development. She called for strong political will to help address African countries in addressing the threat of terrorism in an interdependent and interconnected world. Noting the role of technologies in helping terrorist groups disseminate propaganda and raise and transfer funds, as well as monitor the movements of security forces and peacekeepers, she recalled last months adoption by the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Council of the \"Delhi Declaration on Countering the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes\", which she hoped would pave the way for a normative framework at the United Nations to address this threat. She underscored the need to fully implement Council resolution 2593 (2021, and for the organ to update its toolkit in countering terrorism. Further, the international community should provide sustainable and adequate financial and logistical support to regional and subregional security initiatives. While several States lack capacity to counter terrorism and require support, some are clearly guilty of aiding and supporting it; the international community must call out the latter and hold them accountable for their double speak. The Council must remain wary of attempts and schemes to distract the fight against terrorism though any hypothetical cause-effect linkages, she said, stressing the need to address climate change holistically through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), suggesting that the growing terrorist threat in Africa be viewed from a certain historical perspective, said foreign interventions weaken and destroy State institutions, as was the case in Iraq, Syria and Libya, creating a breeding ground for terrorists, helping criminals to profit and use the artificially created socioeconomic distress of States to recruit new supporters into their ranks. The situation in Africa requires swift responses, including from the United Nations, he said, noting that the necessary counter-terrorism mechanisms have already been developed within the United Nations, primarily in the Council. States have specific obligations to counter terrorism, which if strictly implemented, will produce the desired results, he stressed, pointing out that the only thing required is active cooperation and the rejection of the policy of double standards. In that regard, he said it is not productive to impose additional counter-terrorism obligations on United Nations missions in Africa. Such an expansion of their mandate is not in line with the specific nature of United Nations presence and diverts valuable resources. Effectively rebuffing terrorists requires coordinated national and regional efforts, he said, commending the measures being taken by African countries to develop coordinated approaches to combating terrorism, including within the framework of subregional organizations.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ) said that as terrorism in Africa is a global threat, counter-terrorism deserves global support. On the question of how United Nations missions in Africa can better support regional counter-terrorism efforts, she pointed out that such missions are not set up to tackle such threats due to various factors, which is why counter-terrorism must primarily be a national responsibility. However, United Nations missions both peacekeeping and political are complementary to national and regional counter-terrorism efforts and can help contribute to stability and protecting civilians, as proved by the close and operational partnerships between UNISOM and ATMIS. Affected States need to act holistically to counter terrorist threats and address underlying conditions that cause radicalization and violent extremism. This calls for integrating counter-terrorism efforts with a broader conflict-sensitive strategy, strengthened by civil society, bilateral and multilateral partners, and ensuring the participation of women. Preventive United Nations missions, such as the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA), must be further enabled. Turning to the issue of sustainable funding for counter-terrorism efforts in the Sahel and coastal West Africa, she reiterated her support for the Secretary-Generals call for a United Nations support office for the G5 Sahel Joint Force. Further, it is necessary for any United Nations funding to be matched by sufficient human rights due diligence and African Union compliance frameworks. She added that Norway actively supports the High-Level Panel on Security, Development and Governance in the Sahel and looks forward to its proposals.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) said the international community must fight terrorism with all means available, including with the use of force. However, while there can never be any justification for any act of terrorism, the eradication of that scourge will not be fully achieved only by condemnation and military means, he stressed. Effective counter-terrorism requires strengthening of the rule of law and institutions, ensuring legitimacy through fair elections, protecting human rights, building open and cohesive societies, and ensuring a fair redistribution of resources to address staggering disparities. The emergence of domestic terrorism, which then might have an international impact, is very often linked to disrespect of human rights, lack of legitimacy, and absence of values of freedom and democracy. The international community must find better ways to reduce inequality within and across countries; fully and strictly implement the \"zero finance to terror policy\"; confront extremist ideologies, online and offline; and never legitimize terrorism in any form. While States specific needs can differ, and while terrorism has evolved in nature, the international community must strengthen its engagement with African Member States, recognize their efforts to enhance the African ownership of counter-terrorism initiatives and policies and ensure that counter-terrorism policies and strategies are implemented globally, in a coordinated manner and with a special emphasis on inclusivity.\n\nZHANG JUN ( China ) said that supporting Africa in combating terrorism is an important responsibility of the Council, which must prioritize resources to help the continent address the most pressing challenges it faces as well as their root causes. The experiences of countries including Mali, Mozambique and Nigeria, which have made tremendous efforts and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, are worth summarizing and disseminating. Further, the international community must scale up its funding as well as intelligence and logistic support in this regard. He called for countries sovereignty to be fully respected, and for no other political conditions to be attached to support. In this regard, he said the arms embargo against Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have had a negative impact and must be adjusted or lifted. Further, he called for support to be lent to regional cooperation, noting that the initiatives of SADC in northern Mozambique have showed some success in organizing a regional collective response to threats. Turning to the issue of funding shortfalls, he called for careful study of the Secretary-Generals proposal to support such efforts through the regular budget and assessed contributions. On the operations of the G5 Sahel, he looked forward to the practical and actionable recommendations of the African Union and United Nations in their strategic assessment of security and governance initiatives in the Sahel, which will help revitalize cooperation. Further, the root causes and symptoms of terrorism and violent extremism must be addressed, through strengthened governance and enhanced support for development.\n\nNATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ) said the Security Council must strengthen its support for African initiatives. Commending regional efforts such as the G5 Sahel joint force, African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and the SADC mission in Mozambique, she pointed out that those efforts, however, are hampered by a structural lack of funding and equipment. The European Union, Africa's leading security partner, contributes more than 90 per cent of the African Union's budget for peace operations through the European Peace Facility, she said, noting its contribution of more than 2.25 billion to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and ATMIS. It is time to put in place sustainable and predictable financing for African peace operations, including through mandatory United Nations contributions, or through an innovative mechanism that would combine them with bilateral contributions. She encouraged the members of the African Union Peace and Security Council and the African Union Commission to redouble their efforts so that a common position can quickly be reached on the financing of African Union-mandated operations. Her country has long been committed to helping West African countries fight terrorism and will continue to provide its support to States in the region that request it, with a partnership-based approach, in support of the national strategies of the States concerned.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) stressed the need for a holistic response to the situation in the Sahel and the stability of the region. While regional efforts, including the Accra Initiative, are essential, a holistic approach to addressing conflict requires building long-term stability through humanitarian and development initiatives, she said. The United Kingdom is helping tackle the rise of disinformation and is working with local journalists to promote moderate voices and address ethnic divisions. The Wagner Group plays a destabilizing role in the region, drives conflict and exploits natural resources in the countries where it operates, she said, stressing: \"Whatever the question, they are not the answer.\" Counter-terrorism efforts must conform with international human rights and humanitarian law. She went on to underscore the need for international cooperation in countering terrorism, and to ensure a sustainable response that avoids duplication. United Nations peacekeeping missions must be allowed to do their job, and host States must not hinder the implementation of mandates set by the Council, including United Nations human rights monitoring.

While the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were filled with strategic arms control talks, only one treaty limiting nuclear arsenals has entered into force over the past two decades: New START (the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Notwithstanding the innovations in its verification regime, the treaty relied heavily on the existing principles of the original START Treaty, together with many of the core players experiences negotiating and ratifying it 20 years earlier.\n\nSince then, however, Russias Putin era and, with it, the growing distrust between Russia and the United States, as well as the retirement of Cold War and post-Cold War arms control experts, have stalled any progress. Other treaties such as the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF Treaty) have been abandoned, and other nuclear-armed states remain outside arms limitation agreements. Despite new technologies and a new security architecture requiring more thought than ever before, substantive proposals and good faith negotiations have been replaced by empty talking points. Additionally, in recent years both the United States and Russia have engaged in unconstructive blaming and shaming efforts, which have further soured the arms control environment and lowered the political will for pursuing negotiations in good faith.\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon advance proportional efforts to overcome these forces, it is only prudent to expect that February 4, 2026 will be the last day of bilateral strategic arms control (Albertson 2021, 78). As a first step, the United States and Russia, on August 25, 2022, submitted a statement to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT Review Conference) committing to \"pursue negotiations in good faith on a successor framework to New START before its expiration in 2026, in order to achieve deeper, irreversible, and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals\" (2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 2022). But that commitment so far appears to be blocked by the dispute over Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nTreaty history\n\n1972/1979: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II)\n\nNuclear arms limitation treaties emerged during a period of intense buildup of US and Soviet strategic nuclear forces. In the late 1960s, the United States realized that the Soviet Union was building up its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) forces to reach parity with the United States and had also begun to construct a limited anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense system around Moscow. Concerned that Russia might eventually be able to launch a first strike and then block US retaliation, President Lyndon Johnson called for strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The hope was that US-Soviet relations could be stabilized through limits on the development of both offensive and defensive strategic systems (US Department of State 2022).\n\nBy 1972, the Soviets were convinced that defensive systems had limitations, allowing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and SALT I to be negotiated and enter into force. SALT I was considered an interim agreement that consisted of a simple freeze, not yet including on-site inspections. Its verification relied on national technical means, referring to intelligence satellites and related capabilities. However, the term was officially left undefined to protect intelligence methods and avoid offending Soviet sensibilities (Gottemoeller 2021, 2; Aftergood 2019).\n\nIn 1979, the United States and the Soviet Union completed the negotiation of SALT II which set a limit of 2,400 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (including ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers), banned the construction of new ICBMs, and limited the number of multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to 1,320. However, the treaty never entered into force due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as well as some US senators criticisms of the Soviet Unions crackdown on internal dissent, the Soviets increasingly interventionist foreign policies, the treatys verification process, and SALT IIs failure to sufficiently limit Soviet MIRV technology that would allow missiles to carry multiple warheads (US Department of State n.d.; Cameron 2022). Nonetheless, both sides agreed to voluntarily observe the SALT II-negotiated limits in subsequent years (US Department of State n.d.).\n\nAs former US Secretary of Defense and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Gates noted, the process itself was likely the most useful part of these talks: \"For the first time, the two sides sat down and began a dialogue about their nuclear weapons and, implicitly, their nuclear strategies. Military and civilian leaders on both sides were able to take the measure of one another and, at the same time, engage their political leaders in an unprecedented way in learning about the balance of terror\" (Gates 1996, 45).\n\n1991: Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\n\nPartially due to the further development of MIRV technology on both sides, the Americans and Soviets realized that strategic systems had to be reduced to prevent either sides out-deployment in warhead numbers. This realization led to the 1980s Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), which eventually became the first ratified treaty that required US and Russian reductionsrather than a mere freezeof strategic nuclear weapons. The START Treaty, signed in 1991 with entry into force three years later, limited both countries to 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 6,000 warheads attributed to ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, and included more detailed sub-limits. Once Russia believed that the benefits of on-site inspections outweighed their concerns over giving the United States reciprocal access, nothing was standing in the way of a verifiable arms control treaty to create more predictability. The detailed verification regime of START, including databases, notifications, and on-site inspections, allowed both sides to better calculate necessary deterrence investments while preventing an arms race (Gottemoeller 2021, 3).\n\nThe United States and Russia subsequently negotiated and signed START II in 1993, committing to additional reductions down to 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers by the end of 2007. Importantly, the treaty included a ban on multiple warheads on ICBMs. While the treaty never entered into force despite a decade-long bilateral effort, it strongly shaped the US Strategic Commands long-term force structure planning (Kristensen 2001, 12).\n\n2002: the Moscow Treaty (SORT)\n\nUnder the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), also called the Moscow Treaty, Russia and the United States agreed in 2002 to further reduce their nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic warheads each by December 31, 2012a nearly two-third reduction from the START I limits. While progressive in its numerical limits, SORT was a very simple treaty, with its text barely exceeding one page and not providing any separate verification measures. Instead, Russia and the United States decided they would continue to rely on START to provide verification until its expiration in December 2009 (US Department of State 2002).\n\n2010: the New START Treaty\n\nFinally, the New START Treaty (officially the \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\") succeeded in further limiting the US- and Russian- deployed long-range nuclear forces down to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery vehiclesthe lowest in over 60 years. For that purpose, New START for the first time counted the actual number of warheads found on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, rather than mathematically calculating numbers based on missile tests as in START. Since bombers do not carry nuclear weapons under normal circumstances, each deployed heavy bomber was attributed one warhead by default to make bombers accountable under the treaty (US Department of State 2010). Therefore, the warheads attributed to bombers do not reflect actual warhead loadsunlike for missiles. Delivery vehicles under New START encompass deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear armaments. It was not until far into the negotiations that Russia and the United States determined these numbers, with Russia originally asking for more warheads while the United States requested more delivery vehicles to protect its advantage in that area (Gottemoeller 2021, 34).\n\nIn addition to the further reduction of these limits, New START created an entirely new limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers. Although this concept was originally introduced by Russia, the United States later embraced the idea as it would, first, prevent Russia from building and storing unlimited numbers of mobile missile launchers since these would count toward the non-deployed limit, and, second, provide the United States with the flexibility to convert bombers to conventional use and overhaul submarines since these would not count under the deployed limits during those processes (Gottemoeller 2021, 83, 112).\n\nAnother aspect of New STARTs flexibility is the preserved \"freedom to mix,\" where each side can decide the composition and structure of its strategic offensive forces if it stays below the total limits. Russia, being a great land power, could continue to rely primarily on ICBMs. On the contrary, the United States, being a sea power, was able to keep more SLBMs than Russia (Gottemoeller 2021, 32). The mix chosen by the United States included no more than 400 deployed ICBMs, no more than 240 deployed SLBMs, and no more than 60 deployed heavy bombers. Beyond an additional 100 non-deployed launchers, a significant number of excess launchers had to be denuclearized or destroyed. Because Russia had significantly fewer launchers than the United States, it did not have to reduce its deployed force.\n\nMost importantly, however, the New START Treaty created what has often been referred to as the \"gold standard\" of verification: procedures governing the conversion and elimination of strategic offensive arms, the establishment and operation of a database of treaty-required information, transparency measures, a commitment not to interfere with national technical means of verification, the exchange of telemetric information, the conduct of on-site inspection activities, and the operation of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) (US Department of State 2022).\n\nInnovations in New STARTs verification regime managed to address both sides concerns about the old START treatys verification regime while better balancing information and burdena core military interest on both sides.\n\nFirst, it streamlined STARTs more burdensome verification regime into two types of verifications: one for deployed systems (Type One) and the other for non-deployed systems (Type Two). They largely encompassed the aspects of previously separate types of inspectionsresulting in slightly longer but much less frequent (up to ten Type One and up to eight Type Two) short-notice on-site inspections annually. This solution fulfilled both militaries interest in avoiding too frequent or overly intrusive inspections that could disrupt operational tempo for days (Gottemoeller 2021, 50).\n\nSecond, it enabled real-time tracking of each others forces by introducing unique identifying numbers for launchers and delivery vehicles, utilizing the existing serial numbers each country already used to track and account for its weapons. This gave inspectors a clear idea of the weapons they needed to find at each site (Gottemoeller 2021, 52).\n\nThird, New START addressed rising cost and accuracy concerns about the conversion and elimination of certain weapon systems. To allow satellites to confirm eliminations, for instance, it determined space and time requirements for displaying eliminated missiles and other treaty accountable items and established the right to request reciprocal inspections of such. To address US concerns about overcounting delivery vehicles under the previous treaty, New START also introduced simplified measures to confirm US conversion and elimination processes, particularly the conversion of all B-1 bombers to conventional-only platforms, the conversion of submarine tubes, and the total elimination of B-52 bombers (Gottemoeller 2021, 121122).\n\nIn the end, while Russia had originally urged for a simpler treaty like SORT, it has praised New START as the \"gold standard\" for verification (Alexander and Ferraro 2010).\n\nThe treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011, and provided the parties with seven years to reduce their forces to these agreed-upon limits. Both sides successfully met the central limits by February 5, 2018, and have since stayed at or below them. Russia and the United States extended the originally 10-year treaty to its maximum 15-year length, now set to expire on February 4, 2026 (US Department of State 2022).\n\nTable 1 compares the limits and verification mea- sures from SALT I to New START.\n\nThe New START Treaty remains in force through February 4, 2026. If no follow-on agreement is concluded before its expiration, then February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals. In other words, anyone under the age of 54 will, for the first time, live in a world without strategic arms control.\n\nShort of a new treaty, Russia and the United States would lose mutual predictability and trust. It would also mean that military planners would have to rely more on worst-case scenarios, subsequently accelerating defense spending that could result in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nSuch a gloomy future is, of course, avoidable. The United States and Russia have several options available to maintain strategic limitations on their arsenals, includingin order of increasing resulting predictability but decreasing feasibilitycontinued adherence through mutual moratoria, the negotiation of a new executive agreement, or the conclusion of an entirely new treaty.\n\nWe explore each one of these three options in this issue. But, to illustrate the urgency with which both countries should pursue them, we first offer a realistic scenario of how US and Russian arsenals could evolve if the current trends remain unchangedthat is, if the last bilateral arms control treaty still active is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement.\n\nThe arms race in high gear\n\nUp until now, both countries have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that both countries will not exceed the force levels dictated by New START. Without bilateral arms control, however, this planning will be thrown into an era of unpredictability and distrust. Both sides would need to reassess their programs to accommodate more uncertain nuclear futures. This would likely result in worst-case scenario planning based on fewer data points and the uncertainty of future force levelsincluding those that would likely exceed New START levels. This could drive significant increases in both countries arsenals, and ultimately lead to mutual accusations of arms racing and international accusations of NPT violations.\n\nThe United States and Russia each have significant numbers of additional nuclear warheads in storage that cannot be loaded on the launchers because of the New START limit of 1,550 deployed warheads. If New START fell away, these warheads could be uploaded in days, weeks, or months, depending on the type of launcher.\n\nThe United States has a significant upload capacity for its deployed missiles. Although all 400 of its deployed ICBMs currently only carry a single warhead, 200 of these use the Mk-12A reentry vehicle and are therefore capable of carrying up to three W78 warheads each. Moreover, the United States has an additional 50 \"warm\" ICBM silos which could be reloaded with missiles if necessary. If the 200 Mk-12A-equipped missiles were uploaded to three warheads each and the 50 reloaded missiles were also equipped with three warheads each, the ICBM force loading could potentially increase from 400 to 950 warheads. In the absence of treaty limitations, the United States could also upload each of its deployed Trident SLBMs with a full complement of eight warheads, rather than the current average of four to five. It could also reactivate the four launch tubes on each nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN)56 in totalthat were disabled under New START. This could potentially more than double the number of deployed US SLBM warheads from approximately 944 today to approximately 2,300 warheads.\n\nEither of these actions would likely take months to complete, particularly given the complexities involved with uploading additional warheads on ICBMs. Moreover, ballistic missile submarines would have to return to port for uploading on a rotating schedule. However, deploying additional warheads to US bomber bases could be done very quickly, and the United States could potentially upload nearly 700 cruise missiles and bombs on B-52 and B-2 bombers.\n\nRussia also has a significant upload capacity, especially for its ICBMs. Russias 40 SS-18 Satan ICBMs can carry up to ten MIRVs; however, it is assumed that they have been downloaded to carry only five to meet the New START limitations. The incoming RS-28 Sarmat ICBM is also reportedly capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs; however, it is assumed that these too will be downloaded upon their deployment if the New START force limits are retained. The SS-27 Yars is also assumed to have been downloaded from four MIRVs to three. As a result, without the limits imposed by New START, Russias ICBM force could potentially increase from approximately 812 warheads to approximately 1,185 warheads.\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles on Russian Borei-class SSBNs are also thought to have been downloaded from an estimated six warheads to four to meet New START limits. Without these limitations, the number of deployed warheads on Russian SSBNs could rise from an estimated 576 to approximately 800. As in the US case, Russian bombers could be loaded relatively quickly with hundreds of nuclear weapons. The number is highly uncertain but assuming approximately 50 bombers are operational, the number of weapons could potentially be increased to nearly 600.\n\nTable 2 considers how both US and Russian strategic nuclear forces could increase if New START is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement in place. If both countries uploaded their delivery systems to accommodate the maximum number of possible warheads, both sets of arsenals would approximately double in size. The United States would have slightly more deployable strategic warheads but Russia would still have a significantly larger arsenal of operational nuclear weapons, given its sizable stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear warheads.\n\nTable 2 presents a worst-case scenario for possible warhead uploads if New START is allowed to expire without any follow-on. Because of the relatively low estimated cost of a simple upload across the triad (about $100 million in one-time costs to the United States), this scenario is not impossible from a budgeting perspective (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3).\n\nIn the longer term, both countries could theoretically go further and pursue costly larger expansions of their strategic nuclear forces, such as going back up to the START I level of 6,000 warheads each. Some voices in the United States have already raised doubts about the New START force limits because of Chinas nuclear buildup (Miller 2022). Depending on the desired degree of flexibility and the cost of new strategic delivery systems, such an expansion could cost the United States, for instance, between $88 billion to $439 billion in one-time acquisition costs, plus $4 billion to $28 billion in annual operation and sustainment costs (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3). This does not even include research and development costs or the Department of Energys costs to produce, sustain, or store more nuclear warheads. It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive.\n\nMoreover, there are expected consequences beyond the offensive strategic nuclear forces that New START regulates. If the verification regime and data exchanges elapse, both countries are likely to enhance their intelligence capabilities to make up for the uncertainty regarding the other sides nuclear forces. Both countries are also likely to invest more into what they perceive will increase their overall military capabilities, such as conventional missile forces, nonstrategic nuclear forces, and missile defense (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 79). These would all come with significant additional costs.\n\nOverall, todays technologies and the geopolitical situation would likely lead to a different style of arms racing than during the Cold War; however, it could similarly become unnecessarily costly and dangerous. Moreover, it could trigger reactions in other nuclear-armed states that might also decide to increase their nuclear forces and the role they play in their military strategies. The good news is that this future is certainly not inevitableeven without a formalized treaty structure beyond 2026. The following sections offer a series of options for both countries that would help prevent an escalation of the arms race. The estimated success of each option depends upon a variety of factors, including political will, legal complexities, and relative degrees of formalization. The following sections are listed in order of their projected feasibility, and thus begin with Plan Cthe most feasible but least sustainable optionand end with Plan A the most challenging yet most optimal outcome.\n\nPlan C: continued adherence to New STARTs core provisions beyond 2026\n\nOne option would be for both countries to simply continue abiding by the core provisions of the treatyeven without the treaty being formally in effect. Such a \"gentlemans agreement\" could be made by the leaders of both the United States and Russia without legislative approval, as opposed to a formal treaty. By agreeing to not exceed the New START limits, each side could continue its current strategic force structure planning and therefore avoid a costly expansion.\n\nSuch an agreement, however, also comes with challenges. Practically, the United States and Russia could certainly continue to adhere to the treaty limitsmuch as they did for a brief period of four months in the interim between START and New START. But without the legal structure of a treaty, the main verification benefits of New STARTdata exchanges, notifications, and inspections could be lost due to the legal difficulties surrounding classified information. This could force both parties to rely exclusively on national technical means for verification, which would severely strain both the resources and capabilities of their respective intelligence communities.\n\nWe now examine the feasibility of this option.\n\nCould bilateral data exchanges and notifications continue after 2026?\n\nWithout a treaty framework to enable the legal exchange of otherwise classified or restricted nuclear weapons data, both Russia and the United States would need to prepare legal avenues to allow them to continue sharing this information. According to former New START chief US negotiator, Rose Gottemoeller, the United States continued notifications as a goodwill gesture and was willing to continue data exchanges during the bridge period between START and New START (Gottemoeller 2022). Given this precedent, it should again be feasible for the United States to legally arrange for data exchanges and notifications. On the other side, Russia did not continue reciprocal notifications during the interim period, despite its promise to continue abiding by the treatys limits. To that end, Russia will need to examine whether it might need to first amend its domestic laws concerning the sharing of classified nuclear information.\n\nCould bilateral on-site inspections continue after 2026?\n\nThe question of on-site inspections continuing beyond the scope of a formalized treaty has been considered by Gottemoeller. In her book, Negotiating the New START Treaty, she notes that:\n\n\"The Russians also raised doubts about the legal status of such an agreement. According to them, they needed a full, legally-binding treaty, duly approved by their State Duma and Federation Council, in order to override their domestic law and permit foreign inspectors. According to the Russian state security law, no foreigners are allowed in sensitive nuclear facilities. A treaty can override that domestic law\" (Gottemoeller 2021, 8586).\n\nThe United States also has laws restricting the access of foreign nationals to sensitive military installations. These too could be overridden by an international treaty, as has been the case with New START.\n\nIt would theoretically be possible for both countries to change their domestic laws to enable on-site inspections to continue in the absence of a treaty framework. There is precedent for attempting this in the United States: In 2009, facing the possibility that START might expire without a follow-on treaty in place, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) brought to the table a bill specifically designed to provide Russian inspectors with the ability to continue on-site inspections for seven months or until the entry into force of a new bilateral treatywhichever came first (S.2727 2009). The bill was ultimately not passed, but its introduction to Congress suggests that a similar path could be considered again if necessary. Such a bill could specifically require the continued implementation of the expired treatys verification protocol and annexes that contain highly detailed instructions for how on-site inspections are to be conducted, including requisite flight paths, aircraft call signs, customs exemptions, lodging, accommodations, and the according of diplomatic immunity upon each partys inspectors and aircrew, among other granular details.\n\nIn the absence of a follow-on treaty, rather than attempting to maintain all existing verification mechanisms, another option could be to reduce the scope of the verification regime altogether. While conventional wisdom holds that more verification is always better, recent scholarship indicates that this may not always be the case. In his doctoral dissertation, political scientist Andrew Reddie posits that \"the most intrusive types of verification are not, as is currently believed, more likely to lead to compliance\" (Reddie 2019). Instead, Reddies analysisbased on more than 1,000 agreement-years of historical datasuggests that highly intrusive inspections could yield a statistically significant greater likelihood of noncompliance than less intrusive types of verification regimes. Reddie suggests that this phenomenon could be the result of a \"surveillance bias,\" in which it is possible that \"a hammer (representing a verification regime) will constantly search for and find a nail (noncompliance). Thus, those agreements that have a more stringent verification mechanisma larger hammermay have a higher probability of detecting non-compliance\" (Reddie 2019).\n\nIf a reduction in the intrusiveness of the treatys verification regime would not necessarily increase the likelihood of noncompliance, both parties could use the opportunity of New STARTs expiration to possibly reduce the invasiveness of future verification mechanisms. This would avoid unwanted challenges triggered by the loss of the treatys inspection protocols once it expires while continuing to adhere to its core provisions and central limits. For example, the United States and Russia could place a hold on conducting Type One and Type Two inspections but continue to exchange compliance data and promise not to interfere with the other partys national technical means of verification.\n\nEven though after New START expires there would be no legal requirement to comply with the treatys core provisions, both countries would still likely have strong normative and geopolitical incentives to continue doing so. This is partially because of the riskeven without on-site inspectionsthat any increase would be detected and exposed by the other sides national technical means. Moreover, during the treatys history, there have been several extended periods when Type One and Type Two inspections were suspendedmost notably during the Covid-19 pandemic, when inspections were paused for nearly two years. During these periods there were no accusations of noncompliance by either side.\n\nA reduction of the verification regime may not necessarily create a compliance problem, but it could create a political one. Historically, Congress has been more amenable to support and provide the resources to implement agreements with robust verification regimes, whereas agreements with relatively looser verification mechanisms, such as SORT or the US-Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have faced fierce resistance. This challenge could be exacerbated by relying exclusively on national technical means for verification, which could potentially result in the intelligence community issuing ranged estimates of Russian warheads and delivery systems rather than knowing the exact numbers of warheads and launchers. Even though using a range in place of a definite number may not significantly affect the United States deterrence calculations, it could produce a domestic political backlash. For instance, if the ranges upper boundary ever came too close to the treatys central limits, the public debate would most likely crystalize over such a high-end estimate and cast doubt about Russias compliance. This challenge is evident in the current debate about how many non-strategic nuclear warheads Russia has. Because these warheads are not limited and declared under a treaty, the US Intelligence Community uses a range of 1,0002,000 warheads, of which the Pentagon uses the higher number, even though the Department of State says it includes retired warheads (US Department of State 2022, 11).\n\nUnder such a \"gentlemans agreement,\" any previously existing protocols to facilitate dispute resolution between the state parties would no longer be formally in effect. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC)the joint body authorized to resolve compliance questions, make technical changes to the treatys protocol and annexes as new weapons are deployed, and mediate other treaty-related disputeswould be officially defunct upon New STARTs expiration. As a result, if one party accused the other of materially breaching the agreement, there would be no formal mechanism for mediating and resolving that dispute. This challenge could be mitigated by the establishment of a new mechanism that mirrors the current role of the BCC.\n\nIn effect, continuing to adhere to New STARTs core provisions would be an informal way of extending the treatys benefits. While this informality would certainly create challenges, the tacit knowledge and practices learned through 15 years of successful New START implementation could help transition both parties into such a new framework. While this option may not be sustainable in the long term, it could be considered a short-term bridge between New START and a follow-on agreement. This could prove particularly useful in the interim period if a mutual political commitment to the treaty remains, but time runs out before a new agreement can be concluded.\n\n*************\n\nAnother obstacle to a non-legally binding handshake agreement is Russias historical insistence on having formally ratified treaties. For instance, Gottemoeller explained that Russia previously rejected a non-legally-binding bridging agreement after START, as it was afraid this would take away the necessary pressure needed to eventually reach a ratified treaty with the United States (Gottemoeller 2022). Russias insistence on formally ratified treaties may also be motivated by its fear that a future US administration could easily pull out of a negotiated executive deal. It is not known how flexible Russia might be today given the diminished likelihood that a two-thirds majority of the US Senate will vote to ratify an arms control treaty with Russia, particularly in the context of Putins invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPlan B: pursuing an executive agreement\n\nAnother option for the United States could be to conclude a follow-on (sole presidential or congressional) executive agreement that would not require the Senates advice and consent for ratification as an Article II treaty would, but would still be as legally binding. Today, more than 90 percent of the United States international agreements are executive agreements concluded by the president (Bradley and Goldsmith 2018, 1278). In the field of arms control, however, executive agreements are still largely unexplored.\n\nA distinctive advantage of pursuing an executive agreement over an Article II treaty is that it would allow each countrys head of state to bypass the Senates advice and consent required for Article II treaty ratification. This would be particularly valuable for the United States given the high degree of political polarization and low likelihood of bipartisan Senate support.\n\nThe flip side of this advantage for the United States, however, is that bypassing Congress in this way could create political backlash for a president. Congress could potentially block funding for a president to implement an executive agreement with Russia or even hold other presidential priorities at risk.\n\nMoreover, if such an executive agreement included anything that could be construed to be a \"further arms reduction,\" it could be challenged under the US Arms Control and Disarmament Act:\n\n\"No action shall be taken pursuant to this chapter or any other Act that would obligate the United States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution or unless authorized by the enactment of further affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States\" (22 USC Ch. 35, Section 2573(b) 1961).\n\nA sole-presidential executive agreement inherently has substantially less congressional buy-in than a treaty ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. Similar to politically-binding agreements, such an executive agreement is likely to be associated directly with the president who concluded it and could therefore be subject to violation or withdrawal by a subsequent president wanting to distinguish themselves from their predecessor. The fate of the JCPOA between the United States and Iranin this case a politically- and not legally-binding agreementexemplifies this dynamic. In 2018, against the advice of nonproliferation experts and many of his own advisors, President Donald Trump violated the agreement mainly because of its association with his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who signed the deal in 2015. This can be contrasted with the fate of New START, which was also negotiated under the Obama administration but remained relatively insulated from President Trumps pattern of withdrawing from treaties and agreementspartly because of New STARTs continued bipartisan support within Congress, particularly from those who voted in favor of the treaty in 2010.\n\nA more politically-sound and -sustainable solution might be a congressional executive agreement that would require a simple majority vote in both the Senate and House.\n\nPlan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\n\nThe ideal option for maintaining transparency, predictability, and mutual limitations of US and Russian nuclear arsenals would be the conclusion of a follow-on treaty to replace New START. That is also the least feasible option, especially as bilateral talks have been placed on hold since Russia invaded Ukraine. Nonetheless, a thorough consideration of each countrys respective arms control priorities could yield some opportunities for common ground when negotiations eventually resume.\n\nIn June 2022, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, Mallory Stewart, described the United States current arms control priorities vis--vis Russia as follows: \"We want to sustain limits beyond 2026 on the Russian systems covered under new START; we want to limit the new kinds of nuclear systems Russia is developing; and we want to address all Russian nuclear weapons, including theater-range weapons\" (Stewart 2022).\n\nPriority one: maintaining strategic limits after New START\n\nThe United States first prioritysustaining mutual limitations beyond 2026is likely to be shared by Russia. Both countries are aware of each others significant strategic upload capacities upon New STARTs expiration, such that each country could more than double their total deployed strategic war- heads in the absence of existing limitations (see \"The arms race in high gear\" section). However, neither side appears to have the political appetite or economic capacity to engage in a strategic arms buildup.\n\nRussias significant interest in preserving the bilateral arms control regime was on full display in the months and weeks leading up to New STARTs extension in 2021. As Andrey Baklitskiy wrote at the time for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace:\n\n\"Both chambers of parliament voted on the extension in just one day, and passed it unanimously. Such speed and consensuslast seen over the annexation of Crimea back in 2014shows how important arms control is to the Russian leadership. [. . .] Recently, it has become fashionable in Russias expert circles to opine that traditional arms control is obsolete as a concept, and doesnt correspond to the reality of the modern world. This view partly stems from the fact that existing treaties have disappeared one after the other, while Moscow has not held talks on a new one for more than a decade. The energy the Russian state has put into supporting arms control efforts, along with the first progress made on this front, could now put an end to that trend\" (Baklitskiy 2021).\n\nPriority two: addressing Russias \"exotic\" new nuclear systems\n\nThe United States second prioritylimiting Russias newer nuclear systemswill pose a greater challenge than maintaining the existing limits beyond 2026, but not an insurmountable one. In March 2018, President Putin unveiled a suite of \"exotic\" new nuclear systemsincluding the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, and the Status-6 Poseidon nuclear torpedoimmediately prompting concerns from US lawmakers that these systems would not be covered by New START limitations (President of Russia 2018; Cotton 2019).\n\nWhile some of these systems do pose arms control challenges, two of themSarmat and Avangardappear to be covered by the treaty. The New START protocols have clear provisions for including \"new types\" of strategic ICBMs within the framework of the treaty, and given that Sarmat has already been tested and is scheduled to be deployed by the end of 2022, Russia will have already provided many of the requisite prototype notifications to the United States (Al Jazeera 2022). In a similar vein, the United States incoming LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM will also enter the treaty smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, Avangard is not a particularly complex case: the hypersonic glide vehicle is carried by treaty-accountable ICBMs and the system itself meets New STARTs definition of a \"re-entry vehicle\" under the description \"that part of the front section that can survive reentry through the dense layers of the Earths atmosphere and that is designed for delivering a weapon to a target or for testing such a delivery\" (US Department of State 2010, 60(7)). As a result, any ICBMs deployed with the Avangard system are now counted toward the central limits for both launchers and warheads.\n\nBoth the United States and Russia seem to agree on how New START will consider these two systems. In 2019, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Andrea Thompson, stated in congressional testimony that: \"We assess at least two of them, the Sarmat heavy ICBM and Avangard hypersonic system would count as existing types and be subject to New START at the appropriate point in their development cycle\" (Thompson 2019). Six months later, the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministrys nonproliferation and arms control department, Vladimir Leontiev, stated at the Valdai Discussion Club:\n\n\"As far as new Russian systems are concerned, the situation is dual. There are two systems that clearly fall under the treaty. First, the Sarmat, which can be easily included in the treaty as a new type ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile), for which there is a special procedure, from the creation of a prototype to its authorization for service. [. . .] There are no big problems with Avangard, either, because it is an optional warhead for an ICBM of the corresponding type, to which the treaty applies, too. [. . .] The Avangard will enter the Treaty very smoothly\" (TASS 2019).\n\nThe statuses of the three other new Russian delivery systemsBurevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhalare less obvious. Neither Burevestnik nor Poseidon are likely to be deployed before New STARTs expiration in February 2026; however, it is worth examining whether any of these would fall under the treatys existing counting rules, given that these could form the basis for a potential follow-on agreement.\n\nArticle V of New START stipulates that: \"When a Party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging, that Party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the Bilateral Consultative Commission.\" The treatys supplementary protocol specifies what constitutes a \"new\" kind of strategic offensive weapon:\n\n\"The term new type means, for ICBMs or SLBMs, a type of ICBM or a type of SLBM, the technical characteristics of which differ from the technical characteristics of an ICBM or SLBM, respectively, of each type declared previously in at least one of the following respects: (a) Number of stages. (b) Type of propellant of any stage. (c) Either the length of the assembled missile without front section or the length of the first stage, by more than three percent. (d) Diameter of the first stage, by more than three percent\" (US Department of State 2010, 46(42)).\n\nIt is unclear whether this definition applies to any of Burevestnik, Poseidon, or Kinzhal, given that none could be considered ICBMs or SLBMs. Burevestnik is a cruise missile, Poseidon is a type of underwater torpedo, and Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile. Moreover, at least two of these systems do not travel on ballistic trajectories, placing them outside the treatys definition of either an \"intercontinental ballistic missile\" or a \"submarine-launched ballistic missile,\" regardless of their launch systems or strategic roles in Russias nuclear arsenal.\n\nHowever, in 2019, then-Under Secretary Thompson added during her congressional testimony that all three \"meet the US criteria for what constitutes a new kind of strategic offensive arms for purposes of New START\" (Thompson 2019).\n\nThis interpretation is not likely to be shared by Russia. In December 2018, Russian officials sent a notice to the United States stating that they \"find it inappropriate to characterize new weapons being developed by Russia that do not use ballistic trajectories of flight moving to a target as potential new kinds of Russian strategic offensive arms. The arms presented by the President of the Russian Federation on March 1, 2018, have nothing to do with the strategic offensive arms categories covered by the Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nIn its notice, Russia asserted that because none of the Burevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhal delivery systems are ICBMs, SLBMs, or heavy bombers, they fall outside the scope of the treaty. The statement also noted that \"the Russian approach to the issue of criteria for defining new kinds of strategic offensive arms for the purposes of this Treaty is being worked at. The Russian Side is open for dialogue on this topic although it does not consider it as a priority taking into account pressing issues of the Treaty implementation discussed currently in the Bilateral Consultative Commission\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nThe complex case for counting Kinzhal under the treaty framework depends entirely upon whether its carrier aircraft fits the treaty definition of an accountable \"heavy bomber.\" The treatys protocol states that an aircraft counts as a \"heavy bomber\" if it either (a) has a combat (meaning unrefueled) range of more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) or (b) is equipped for nuclear air-launched cruise missiles with a range exceeding 600 kilometers (370 miles) (US Department of State 2010, 23(80)). Given that Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile, it does not satisfy the latter criterion. However, depending on how Russia intends to deploy the system, it could satisfy the former criterion.\n\nRussia deploys Kinzhal on its specially-modified MiG-31IK Foxhound aircraft and has used the system in combat at least three times during its invasion of Ukraine (Kristensen and Korda 2022a; TASS 2022). The MiG-31IKs combat range is estimated to be approximately 1,250 kilometers (770 miles)significantly below the 8,000-kilometer threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000a). As Pranay Vaddi, now Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, wrote in 2019 for Lawfare: \"In this case, Kinzhal would not be accountable under New START, and neither should it be. Because the MiG-31 has a very limited range, it is not, even when armed with Kinzhal, the kind of strategic weapon that New START was intended to limit. Rather, if Kinzhal is deployed on a MiG-31, it will likely fill a limited, theater-strike role\" (Vaddi 2019).\n\nHowever, news reports have indicated that Russia may also deploy Kinzhal on its longer-range Tu-22M3M Backfire bombers (TASS 2018; RIA Novosti 2018). The upgraded Tu-22M3Ms are currently not classified as \"heavy bombers\" under New START because they are estimated to have a combat range of approximately 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles), whichif correctremains below the 8,000-kilometer (4,971 miles) threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000b). The United States raised concerns about the upgraded Tu-22M3M system to Russia in September 2018, to which Russia responded as follows:\n\n\"The Russian side indeed plans to carry out modernization of Tu-22M3 bomber to the modification Tu-22M3M. This modernization will prolong the service life of the aircraft, as well as improve its systems of maneuverability, navigation and use of air weapon systems. At the same time, the range of the bomber will be below 8000 km, and it will not be equipped for nuclear [air-launched cruise missiles] with range exceeding 600 km. Proceeding from the aforementioned facts, the technical characteristics of the Tu-22M3M aircraft in accordance with paragraph 23 (80) of Part One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty do not allow to classify it as a heavy bomber and it will not fall under the limitations of the New START Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nWhile the combat range of the upgraded Tu-22M3M may remain below 8,000 kilometers, it appears that the modernized aircraft will likely have probes to facilitate mid-air refueling (Interfax 2018). This is a significant alteration of the aircraft that will allow it to potentially reach intercontinental ranges. For this reason, these probes had been previously removed from Russias Tu-22M aircraft under the SALT II process, and the Soviet Union had made a politically binding declaration on July 31, 1991, that \"it will not give the Tu-22M airplane the capability of operating at intercontinental distances in any manner, including by in-flight refueling\" (Vance 1979; US Department of State 1991). However, this long-standing policy appears to now have been reversed, with defense sources telling Interfax in 2018 that: \"The new refueling equipment will significantly increase Tu-22M3Ms combat radius and range of operation. The range will be comparable with one of strategic bombers\" (Interfax 2018).\n\nWhile this may not technically trigger the reclassification of the Kinzhal/Tu-22M3M combination as a treaty-accountable \"heavy bomber\" given that the aircrafts unrefueled range is still likely to remain below the 8,000-kilometer threshold, the de facto transformation of a medium-range aircraft into an intercontinental-range aircraft could be enough for the United States to raise the matter at the BCC or in other bilateral forums. Moreover, in the context of negotiating a follow-on treaty, the United States could seek to close this potential loophole by addressing the fact that mid-flight refueling capabilities could theoretically turn a tactical bomber into a strategic one.\n\nPriority three: addressing all Russian nuclear weapons\n\nThe United States third prioritylimiting all of Russias nuclear weaponslikely poses the greatest challenge given the difficulty of verification and existing force asymmetry.\n\nThe United States is likely aware of the challenge, thus phrasing its goal to \"address all Russian nuclear weapons\" rather broadly. This could, for a start, be achieved through unverified data exchanges. Nonetheless, any negotiations that concern non-strategic nuclear warheads will be complicated by the asymmetry of Russia having up to 10 times more non-strategic nuclear warheads than the United States (1,912 compared to 200) (Kristensen and Korda 2022a, 2022b). Were Russia willing to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in a treaty, it would likely ask for US concessions in another area, although it has not specified so far what this might be. The Russian government did state, however, that a precondition for discussing non-strategic nuclear weapons is that the United States withdraws such weapons from Europe (Berestovaya 2021). Other areas of asymmetry Russia could try to pull into a negotiation package might concern US missile defenses and conventional weapons.\n\nExacerbated by existing political tensions and the current arms control deadlock between the two countries, this issue is not likely to be resolved anytime soon. Rather, an effort to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in an arms control treaty could require several years of negotiations and confidence-buildingpossibly spanning multiple presidential administrations.\n\nLessons learned and next steps\n\nTo address the challenges of building a follow-on framework, we now look at the lessons learned from previous arms control negotiations and identify strategies the United States might follow to eventually achieve a successful outcome.\n\nClarify national security interests and identify corresponding arms control tools\n\nIt is common wisdom that arms control is not an end in itself, but is instead a means to ensure national security. In this view, any future arms control negotiations need to be preceded by a thorough reevaluation of the national security interests they are meant to achieve. During the Cold War, arms control worked in tandem with deterrence and other elements of national power to manage strategic competition. When the Cold War ended, the role of arms control changed to a collaborative tool to manage, first, a controlled drawdown of excess strategic forces, then, deep cuts of nuclear forces, and eventually, elimination. With the pendulum swinging back to strategic competition, arms control may once again have to serve principally as a tool to manage strategic competition. It is therefore important to address expectations about what arms control can tangibly achieve in the coming years.\n\nAs noted above, US officials and leading nuclear scholars have repeatedly listed the following as problems that arms control should address: the loss of transparency with Russia, Chinas buildup, new weapons, risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation, and the deterioration of international norms. This section explores how the United States should prioritize these issues given the return to strategic competition, and which arms control tools it should rely on for each.\n\nFirst, with the war in Ukraine and the generally growing risk of regional conflicts involving China or Russia, the United States most pressing interest should be to minimize the risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation. The United States time would likely not be wasted here as ensuring \"nonevents\" constitutes \"a strong mutual interest among the United States, Russia, and China\" (Talmadge 2022). Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021). Given Putins escalatory language regarding Ukraine, these measureswhich luckily do not require a formal treatycannot wait any further. In the short term, they would complement New START. In the intermediate term, they would provide some limited, but much-needed confidence should there be no immediate follow-on treaty. In the longer term, risk reduction efforts may \"create opportunities for the parties to address and resolve those security concerns that are blocking the path to nuclear disarmament\" (Woolf 2021).\n\nSecond, the United States should prioritize preventing the loss of transparency regarding Russian strategic nuclear weapons as these continue to comprise most nuclear weapons that can reach the US homeland. In the medium-term, these are still owned by Russia, not China. New STARTs verification and monitoring regime continues to be a highly suitable tool in this regard, because it allows the United States to track the numbers, types, sizes, locations, readiness, and movements of these weapons. This information helps avoid misunderstandings and worst-case planning assumptions that would otherwise fuel a new arms race. It would therefore be in the United States best interest to continue a similar mutual verification and monitoring regime of offensive strategic nuclear forces. For non-strategic nuclear weapons, data declarations would likely be the most suitable transparency tool to address the United States concerns for now. Issues surrounding intrusiveness and feasibility make a fully verifiable framework for these weapons rather difficult absent the necessary political will.\n\nThird, given the US bipartisan concern with Russian treaty violations and the resulting deterioration of international norms, it is within US interest to revitalize the latter. The value of any future arms control treaty or agreement diminishes if it becomes common practice to simply violate them or exit them on a whim. Therefore, to ensure that arms control negotiations are worth the effort and that their value does not disappear overnight, it will be essential to revive international norms surrounding nonproliferation. This could be achieved through bilateral and multilateral normative statements, use of doctrine and strategy dialogues, as well as various tools to increase exit costsincluding treaty provisions and allied, or ideally multilateral, commitments to sanction noncompliant parties.\n\nFinally, how do the traditional tools of arms controllimitations and reductionshold up today? Deep numerical reductions are unlikely without Russian and Chinese participation, given the level of prior reductions, expectations of cheating, and especially the new geopolitical order with Chinas growing military power and nuclear arsenal. However, all three countries need to do their best to overcome these forces as soon as possible and fulfill their disarmament obligations under the NPT. Regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons thatunlike strategic weaponsdo not pose a direct threat to each countrys homeland, reductions would not solve the most pressing concern: escalation through first use in a regional, conventional conflict (such as in Ukraine). Any remaining nuclear warheads could still be used first and risk escalation. For this reason, it is important to realize that reductions themselves should be a longer-term interest, and need to be complemented by other arms control tools such as the ones mentioned earlier. More immediate concerns regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons would be better addressed through risk reduction tools, transparency measures, and the strengthening of international norms.\n\nDespite the limitations of traditional arms control tools, however, the United States (and Russia) would continue to benefit from the force predictability if limits on launchers and warheads remained. Opponents of arms control have for a long time tried to argue that these limits lead to decreased deterrence because it makes the United States reduce its nuclear forces while Russia keeps proportionally investing more into modernizing theirs (Trachtenberg 2021, 7). But changes in deterrence are largely the result of countries having different military doctrines rather than the treaties provisions. For instance, Russia relies more on its nuclear arsenal given its conventional forces inferiority. Today, given the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear triad and its higher number of strategic launchers and larger inventory of strategic nuclear warheads, the United States should feel confident that its deterrent will be preserved in respect to Russia under continued limits on launchers and warheads.\n\nThe key challenge is how Chinas growing nuclear arsenal will affect these numerical and qualitative assessments of the US-Russian balance. Is the credibility of the US nuclear deterrent reduced because of Chinas buildup? Will it undermine the US-Russian balance? If the United States increases its nuclear arsenal, will that cause either Russia or China to increase theirs even more? \"The challenge will then be to redress Russias and Chinas worst-case assessments that the capabilities the United States deploys to deter both countries could or would be used to defeat either one of them. If new approaches to arms control cannot be invented, the world is likely to see worsening security dilemmas, arms racing, and instability\" (Dalton et al. 2022, 13).\n\nBeyond that, future negotiators will likely want to focus on issues other than simple numerical reductions of launchers and warheads, such as the asymmetry in the nuclear production complexesthe roots of the nuclear warhead tree (Albertson 2022, 66). China, concerned about the survivability of its nuclear forces, may be reluctant to agree to fissile material production cut-offs. Because these concerns are partially driven by US missile defenses, it might, however, be open to combining this issue with a moratorium on the deployment of space-based missile defenses, the most plausible means for the United States to undermine Chinas nuclear deterrent (Acton, MacDonald, and Vaddi 2021, 5152).\n\nBuild arms control expertise\n\nTo have any chance at preventing the loss of strategic arms controls benefits and develop remedies to safeguard strategic stability, the US government will need to make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise.\n\nOne important factor that contributed to the arms control achievements in the mid-1980s to 1990s was the amount of expertise in the executive and legislative branches. Those who lived through the Cold War were naturally more concerned with, and educated on, nuclear weapons issues. Moreover, Congress still took its role in foreign policy seriously, and the Senate engaged in arms control through the bipartisan Arms Control Observer Group. For instance, Senate members of this group were tasked to consult with and advise US arms control negotiating teams, and \"to monitor and report to the Senate on the progress and development of negotiations\" (Roth 2014).\n\nToday, however, most of these arms control experts in the executive branch and Senate have retired or in other ways moved on. Current staff has not been able to benefit from the direct experience and on-the-job training of the negotiating, ratification, implementation, and verification processes. The New START Treaty negotiations were the last to benefit from the contributions of the remaining experts and champions from this era (Albertson 2021, 78). The Senate, while still somewhat engaged in the New START negotiations through the National Security Working Group, has largely lost the expertise from the days of the more-engaged Senate Arms Control Observer Groupdue to increased partisanship, diminished prestige, and the GOPs growing skepticism of legally binding international commitments (Roth 2014).\n\nTo regain the interest and expertise needed to think through todays arms control issues, the US government should (1) make significant staffing, training, and retention investments; and (2) increase cooperation and exchange between Congress and the executive branch again. The latter could be achieved possibly through a revitalized congressionally-appointed liaison group as former Sen. Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz previously proposed (Nunn and Moniz 2017).\n\nAlthough much of the deep technical expertise needed to develop effective arms control tools will require access to classified information, these efforts can, to some degree, be pursued in concert with civil society. External funding provided by foundations and philanthropic organizations has traditionally played an instrumental role in hiring, training, and empowering future generations of arms control experts. Many of these experts typically rotate through government at some point during their careers, and they rely on their external networks to both brainstorm new arms control ideas and build support for them in the public discourse. To that end, increased funding for civil society could play a pivotal role in fostering the deep bench of political and technical experts needed to pursue successful arms control negotiations in the future.\n\nDemonstrate Presidential leadership\n\nIt is likely that the chances of any follow-up agreement will be closely related to the degree of presidential lea-dership, support, and involvement in the negotiations, even if such an agreement is ratified in Congress and is not an executive agreement. It is essential to articulate national security objectives at the highest level as soon as possible in the process. If leaders are engaged throughout, the rest of the government will set it as a priority (Gottemoeller 2021, 172).\n\nRose Gottemoeller, the US lead negotiator of New START, assesses that the greatest asset to the treatys negotiations was the willingness of both US President Barack Obama and Russia President Dmitry Medvedev to engageand to use their knowledge about treaty issues. The opening of the New START formal negotiations can arguably be attributed to a US-Russian presidential joint statement that laid out the subject and scope of the new agreement. Two months after the first round of meetings, another presidential joint understanding that contained limit ranges likely enabled the negotiators to operate at a relatively quick pace.\n\nMoreover, there was great and important progress when President Obama and President Medvedev agreed on final warhead and delivery vehicle limits during a side meeting at the 2009 Climate Summit in Copenhagen (Gottemoeller 2021, 46, 89, 91). Throughout these and other arms control negotiations, Russian negotiators have in the past been more likely to consider concrete proposals when they came from a presidential level.\n\nFinally, given the Russians skills at slow-rolling, both presidents agreeing on the same timeline was vital to the relatively timely success of the New START negotiations.\n\nPresidential backing, first, ignited the talks and, second, saved much time by allowing the negotiators to focus on the agreed-upon scope. In the context of a future follow-on agreement, it could be possible to negotiate a technical framework using interagency guidance before any public summit if the political environment is too challenging. It is clear that presidential leadership throughout the New START negotiations provided the delegations on both sides with the needed bureaucratic firepower to get things done quickly, and helped move negotiations along when they were seemingly stuck.\n\nUnderstand the other side: Russia\n\nOn the Russian side, it is critical to understand the role that nuclear weapons play in their politics, military strategy, andperhaps most importantlyits perception of itself as a nation (Williams 2016). Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, describes well the crucial role of such an understanding in a report describing his unprecedented visits to Russias nuclear complex in 1992:\n\n\"We quickly discovered that the Russian view of its nuclear enterprise could not have been more radically different than the prevailing American view. Our Russian colleagues and the nuclear ministry viewed their nuclear weapons and nuclear complex as the crowning achievement of Soviet times and essential to Russias political, scientific, and economic future. With Russias conventional forces having atrophied, nuclear weapons were viewed as their guarantor of sovereignty, assuring Moscow a seat at the international table. Nuclear materials were seen as an economic resource and a national treasure. Nuclear experts and their scientific institutions were seen as an engine for the recovery of the national economy\" (Hecker 2017, 6).\n\nIn the 30 years since these visits, Russias view of its nuclear enterprise has not changed much, particularly considering the poor performance of its conventional forces in conflicts, epitomized by its current war against Ukraine. But perhaps surprisingly, this imbalance may be a boon for arms control given that Russia has typically viewed its participation in such negotiations as evidence of its \"great power\" status. Additionally, Russia may view a renewed arms control agreement as a pathway toward renegotiating the global geopolitical order on its own terms. As a result, Russia is likely to view arms control in a relatively positive light compared to other nuclear-armed states like China.\n\nAlthough Russia is likely to be relatively amenable to the prospect of nuclear negotiations (as suggested by their quick extension of New START in 2021), they, like the United States, will not enter into agreements unless these serve their national security interests. Several key Russian security concerns may need to be addressed to ensure a successful follow-on agreement.\n\nChief among these concerns is the development of advanced US missile defenses. Russia has long regarded the limitation of anti-ballistic missiles as the \"cornerstone of strategic stability,\" and has often explicitly characterized missile defense limits as a precondition to strategic arms control. In 2000, President Vladimir Putin noted that \"the mutual reduction of strategic attack weapons . . . is possible only when the ABM Treaty continues to hold\" (Woolf 2002). Additionally, throughout the New START negotiations, Russian negotiators attempted on several occasions to bring the issue of missile defense to the tableparticularly following pressure from Putin, for whom missile defense was a priority issue (Gottemoeller 2021, 97).\n\nGiven the advancements in US defensive capabilities and Putin being back in the presidential seat today, it is likely that Russia will continue pressing the issue of US missile defenses. As Russia has historically been highly effective at drawing out negotiations, they may initially insist again on US concessions in this areabut they should hopefully recognize that it would not be worth jeopardizing strategic offensive arms control over the issue.\n\nIf Russia refuses to yield, however, the United States could again offer to place some limits on its missile defenses as part of a negotiation. At present, the US missile defense architecture appears to be an ever-evolving, open-ended projectrather than a clearly-defined effort to reach specific deterrence objectives. This has been recently underscored by increasingly blurred lines between theater and homeland defenses, as well as President Trumps assertion that US missile defense will continue to evolve to \"detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace\" (Sonne 2019). These factors likely validate the concerns of Russian strategists who largely never believed previous US assurances about the limited nature of their defenses (Woolf 2002).\n\nTo that end, the United States could consider establishing clear goals and limitations for its missile defense architecture, clearly communicate them to Russia, and then assess which constraints would be acceptable to unblock the path toward strategic arms control. Such constraints would not necessarily have to affect existing US capabilities but could involve placing a cap on interceptors at a higher level than what is currently deployed (Arbatov 2021). Given Chinas similar concerns about US defenses, such actions could potentially also help bring China to the negotiating table.\n\nFinally, regarding one of the United States core concernsnonstrategic nuclear weaponsRussia has so far repeatedly posed preconditions to even begin talks that have been perceived as a pretext to avoid negotiations: the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and the elimination of NATOs nuclear-sharing arrangements and related infrastructure. While the Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons posture has been transitioning to a combination of assets in support of specific missions, the Russian military, political leadership, and elites still believe that Russia needs a larger non-strategic nuclear weapons force than does NATO. This is primarily because Russia sees its non-strategic nuclear weapons to some extent as compensation for the larger US strategic nuclear arsenal.\n\nBecause Russia is unlikely to agree to equal ceiling and intrusive verification measures, a phased approach starting with transparency measures would be more promising. However, Russia might be susceptible to an effort to put its 2020 political commitment to freeze its nuclear stockpile back on the table (Pomper et al. 2022, 4647). In the longer term, to overcome Russias perceived need to compensate for having less strategic nuclear weapons, actual reductions might need to wait for future negotiations including the United Kingdom, France, and China (against whom Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons could be used in a strategic way).\n\nUnderstand the other side: China\n\nThe Chinese side is more difficult to understand. First, China has never engaged in nuclear arms control talks with the United Statesunlike Russia, with which the United States has half a century of experience. Second, while China formally maintains a no-first-use policy, doctrinal debates are still ongoing about the limits of this policy (Leveringhaus 2022). To make matters worse, the security concerns related to the two countrys growing competition have restricted opportunities for US-Chinese academic exchanges that would allow the United States to better understand Chinas goals and doctrine (Zhao 2021).\n\nWhat seems clear, however, is that it would be almost impossible to include China in an immediate follow-on treaty to New START. First, the remaining time until February 2026 is not enough to include an entirely new negotiating partner with whom no such negotiating history or relations exist. Notably, it took the United States and Russia decades to get to their first verifiable arms control treaty. Second, Chinese officials have explicitly and repeatedly rejected joining arms limitation talks and previously suggested that they will join such negotiations only after the \"huge gap\" between their arsenal and the US and Russian nuclear arsenals has been closed. Until then, however, they have signaled that they stand ready to discuss \"all issues related to strategic stability and nuclear risk reduction in the framework of P5, [the UN Security Councils five permanent members, including] China, Russia, US, UK, and France\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peoples Republic of China 2020).\n\nChina likely perceives time to be on its side and is probably waiting until it gains the needed leverage to become a more equal negotiating partner in this area. The projected increase in the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenalperhaps with up to 1,000 warheads by 2030 (US Department of Defense 2021, 90) and potentially as many ICBMs as each of the United States and Russiacould potentially create new opportunities for arms control discussions around the end of this decade. But, even then, China is unlikely to agree to strategic arms control limits until it feels confident enough in its nuclear forces continued survivability. Moreover, China has traditionally relied on secrecy and opacity to help safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal (Riqiang 2016). It would have to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime like the New START treaty.\n\nMeanwhile, to make any progress, the United States should continue to explore the following questions: What are the lessons from previous nuclear dialogues with China that may form the basis for future joint efforts? A previous track 1.5 dialogue (a term of art to describe situations in which both official and non-official actors cooperate) with China clarified that China, seeking recognition for its prominent role in the new international order, is interested in discussing a \"new paradigm of strategic stabilityone not built around deterrent threats, especially nuclear blackmailbut broader ideals of cooperation and mutual respect \" (Santoro and Gromoll 2020, 11). The United States needs to therefore think about possible ways to make China feel this interest is being addressed while preserving its national security priorities.\n\nMoreover, Chinas strategic stability concerns all center around the fear that the United States might be after \"absolute security,\" looking to overcome mutual vulnerability. Therefore, the current and future US administrations should consider tools to build confidence in this area with China. Even if informal and on a track 1.5 basis, these could eventually lay the groundwork for a first treaty with China.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for cooperation with China, the United States should also explore the following questions: Is there any room for the United States and China to slowly start exchanging certain types of information about each others strategic nuclear forces, in particular those types about which China might not feel as protective? What would the United States be prepared to offer China in exchange for limits on Chinese nuclear forces? Is a more creative French-style approach to negotiations neededthat offers to combine unrelated issues, which in Chinas case would include tariffs, special economic zones, and other economic issues? How can the United States best leverage the P5 forum for risk reduction with China?\n\nMake long-term investments\n\nBecause of the difficulty of achieving the United States current objectives, especially the inclusion of China, in a follow-on treaty, it is advisable to develop and pursue a long-term strategy for achieving these goals. Given the current geopolitical context, a treaty covering Chinese strategic nuclear forces might not happen until the 2030s when China feels secure enough in its nuclear deterrent capability and negotiation leverage.\n\nTo be ready once the other side agrees to talk, the United States should start making the following long-term investments. First, it should develop its positions on priority demands and possible concessions it would be willing to make in negotiations with both Russia and China. Second, it should explore all possibilities for the national laboratories to engage in technical verification exchanges and preparations with both Russia and China to ensure technical details will be ready once circumstances are ripe for new treaties and agreements. Additionally, to increase cooperation with China that may lead to more cooperation in the area, the United States may consider offering early warning training to China which is intensively developing its early warning capability. Something similar was considered for Russia during the Cold War and would have the added benefit of reducing miscalculation risks. Finally, the United States should view even unfruitful negotiations as a means to build and maintain arms control negotiation expertiseas well as to uphold communication channelsuntil a treaty can be successfully negotiated and concluded.\n\nGet the militarys support\n\nHaving the militarys support is key to both negotiations and ratification. First, the US Department of Defense is one of the most important US interagency stakeholders, and the interagencys support has proven crucial during negotiations. During the New START negotiations, Gottemoeller assesses the strong Pentagon support to be one of the core factors in the negotiations success (Gottemoeller 2021, 96). Getting the two top military leaders together helped overcome institutional resistance in each military bureaucracy (Gottemoeller 2021, 70). US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen and Russian Gen. Makarov, by simply agreeing on the main issues and their priority, gave the Russian delegations military members a high-level boost within the Russian Ministry of Defense for working the details (Gottemoeller 2021, 74).\n\nSecond, the militarys support increases the chances of ratification. Many senators simply do not wish to be on the record for voting against the military.\n\nThe militarys support is best achieved primarily by listening to and addressing its concerns. In the New START negotiations, for instance, the US military services were worried about the costs of elimination procedures and the operational interruptions due to inspections (Gottemoeller 2021, 63). The negotiators focus and dedication toward this issue helped ensure their support. Moreover, involving the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as much as possible throughout the negotiations can be key in this effort too as it will make the military feel like it partially owned the process.\n\nFuture arms control will have to solve several problems for the US military. First, old problems that are likely to resurface without a follow-on to the New START Treaty should not be discounted. These concern primarily the lack of constraints on Russian nuclear forces which would incentivize a new arms race and the costs of the additionally-needed intelligence collection and analysis in the absence of a verification mechanism. In fact, after the New START Treatys executive extension in 2021, US Gen Hyten, who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to 2021, expressed his and other Department of Defense officials support of the treaty especially because of its nuclear weapons limits and verification process (Vergun 2021).\n\nAdditionally, the amount of military backing is likely to increase with the number of new problems the negotiations manage to address. Gen. Hyten is one of many Department of Defense officials to reiterate that new Russian weapons and Chinas buildup are increasingly posing strategic problems for the US military (Vergun 2021). Addressing these issues in some form or another through future arms control approaches would likely help this US administration, or the next, get the necessary military support. Moreover, maintaining deterrence through a strong nuclear triad has historically been a strong military interestalthough there is reasonable debate on what is needed in this regard. Overall, it is advisable to frame any future arms control approaches within a framework that seeksand getsthe militarys support.\n\nGain bipartisan support\n\nTo be sustainable, a follow-on agreement would need broad bipartisan support to remain insulated from politicization. This is particularly critical given the likelihood of political fluctuation in the House, Senate, and presidency over the coming years. New STARTs survival throughout the Trump administrations pattern of treaty withdrawals can be partially attributed to continued bipartisan support within Congressincluding from senators who initially voted in favor of the treaty in 2010 and remained in Congress throughout that tumultuous period.\n\nTo that end, a follow-on agreement must address the concerns of both major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans. Chief among these are concerns over breakout potential and verification.\n\nOne prominent critique of New START is that it could incentivize warhead uploading in a crisis because both parties are permitted to retain an unlimited number of non-deployed strategic warheads (Smith 2020). As discussed earlier, both countries do indeed have a significant upload capacity and could more than double their number of deployed warheads if necessary. However, a potential breakout scenario is likely to be more of a Russian concern than a US one: given that the United States has a larger number of empty launch spots on its missiles than Russia does, the United States has a significantly larger upload capacity. As a result, a potential breakout capacity should be more of a fear for Russia than for the United States, making the prospect of a Russian breakout unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, even though a significant upload would accelerate the arms race, it may not necessarily affect strategic stability between the United States and Russia. In 2012, a joint report by the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to Congress noted that: \"The Russian Federation . . . would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty, primarily because of the inherent survivability of the planned US strategic force structure, particularly the OHIO-class ballistic missile submarines, a number of which are at sea at any given time\" (US Department of Defense 2012). This argument could potentially be used in the future to mitigate fears among US policy makers of a future breakout scenario.\n\nAnother critique of New START centers around the treatys verification regimespecifically, that a limited number of on-site inspections may not be enough to verify compliance with the treatys central limits on deployed warheads. As explained by Bryan Smith, a senior fellow at the George Mason Universitys National Security Institute:\n\n\"[E]ven if a US inspection revealed that a particular missile was loaded with a number larger than Russia had declared, there is no logical way to infer from thisor any such discrepancythat the entire force had exceeded the 1,550 warhead limit. Conversely, neither could we logically conclude that the entire force complied with the 1,550 limit, even if the 20-30 percent lifetime sample inspections all confirmed that the observed warhead loadings matched their declarations.\" (Smith 2020)\n\nGiven Russias pattern of violating arms control agreements, such concerns should be taken seriously. Yet, perfect verificationthat is, accurate and exhaustiveis not necessary for the success of an agreement. Rather, the United States should be satisfied with ensuring Paul Nitzes definition of effective verification that \"if the other side moves beyond the limits of the treaty in any militarily significant way, we would be able to detect such violations in time to respond effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of the violation\" (Nitze 1988).\n\nIt is therefore possible for the United States to achieve effective verification of a treaty through limited on-site inspections. Ivan Oelrich, a former vice president of the Federation of American Scientists, comprehensively addressed the prospect of Russian cheating in 2010:\n\n\"Say the Russians wanted to cheat by putting more warheads than allowed on, say, 10% of their missiles. [. . .] They would have to put the warheads on missiles and then lie on the data exchange and hope they dont get caught. So, if we pick our inspection sites randomly, then there is a 10% chance they will get caught in one inspection and a 90% chance they will get away without detection on that one inspection. But there is only an 81% chance of getting past two inspections, 73% chance away with three, and so on. If we do 10 inspections, there is a 2/3 chance we will catch a violation of only a 10% cheat, hardly odds that would appeal to a prospective cheater. There is a 90% chance we would catch a 20% cheat. Just in the first 10 inspections. Remember that inspections continue over the years and our confidence will increase over time, approaching near certainty that even small violations will be detected by the time the warhead limits are reached\" (Oelrich 2010).\n\nAs a result, to alleviate these broader political concerns over verification, the United States should aim to incorporate a sufficient number of on-site inspections into any follow-on agreement. A rough calculation to determine an acceptable number of inspections can be derived, as done above, by estimating the percentage of missiles where Russia will try to cheat and selecting a confidence percentage of acceptable risk. The formula is expressed as follows: 1-x = yz, where x is the desired confidence percentage, y is the likelihood of not catch- ing a cheating Russia during each independent inspection, and z is the number of necessary inspections.\n\nFor example, if the United States suspects that Russia could try to cheat with 10 percent of its missiles, then it will need at least 21 inspections to achieve a 90 percent confidence rating that Russia is not cheating at that rate. It would need at least 28 inspections to achieve a 95 percent confidence rating, and at least 229 inspections to achieve a 99 percent confidence rating. The desired confidence rating, coupled with an educated assessment of Russias capability and intent to cheat, will help determine how many on-site inspections would be sufficient to verify an agreement. However, these will need to again be carefully weighed with the militarys operational costs and sensitivity concerns. Due to the US Senates concerns about Russian cheating and the return to great power competition since New STARTs negotiations, the right balance might end up requiring a higher confidence rating today.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon put in proportional efforts to overcome the political forces stalling meaningful dialogue, February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals.\n\nRussia and the United States would lose mutual predictability, and military planners would have to consider an increased worst-case scenario, starting with the possible upload of nearly doubleor possibly more, in the case of the United Statesthe total number of warheads on strategic delivery vehicles. Both sides would inevitably accelerate defense spending, resulting in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nTo preserve bilateral arms control in these times of strategic competition, the United States and Russia should consider and prepare for several options, with trade-offs between feasibility and ambition: continued adherence through mutual moratoria the negotiation of a new executive agreement, and the conclusion of an entirely new treaty. The first two options have the benefit of not requiring legislative approval. However, their value would depend on the amount of political will on both sides to legally enable continued verification and refrain from cheating or exiting the agreement. At the same time, the United States and Russia need to carefully examine and prioritize their underlying interests for the option of a follow-on treaty. Even if a follow-on treaty fails to be ready by February 2026, strategic arms control treaty history has demonstrated that there are reasonable options for bridging treaty-less periods.\n\nThe history of treaty negotiations informs the next steps for the US government: (1) re-evaluate the full box of arms control tools in the light of strategic competition, (2) make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise, (3) understand Russian and Chinese strategic priorities, (4) ensure readiness to negotiate once Russia and eventually China agree to talk, (5) get the militarys support, (6) ensure presidential leadership, and (7) gain bipartisan support. The best practices for each of these steps should help guide the next generation of arms control champions and ensure that the United States, Russia, and China can temper the most dangerous impulses of geopolitical competition and pursue their mutual security priorities through strategic arms control.\n\n(Editors note: The text on pages 354 and 355 of the PDF version of this articlestarting from one paragraph above the subheading \"Plan B: pursuing and executive agreement\" and ending at the subheading \"Plan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\"has been corrected for issues of fact.)",

                "cc_text": "Washington CNN\n\nSenior US officials have in recent weeks been urging Ukraine to signal that it is still open to diplomatic discussions with Russia, amid concerns that public support for the countrys war effort could wane with no end to the conflict in sight and neither side willing to begin peace talks, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nThe discussions are not aimed at encouraging the Ukrainians to negotiate now rather, the US wants Kyiv to convey more clearly that it wants to find a resolution to the conflict and that Ukraine has the moral high ground, sources said.\n\nOfficials including National security adviser Jake Sullivan began more urgently pressing the Ukrainians to shift their rhetoric after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree in early October ruling out any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That decree came in response to Russias self-declared annexation of territories in eastern Ukraine following sham referendums there.\n\n\"We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,\" Zelensky said last month.\n\nSullivan discussed the issue directly with Zelensky during a trip to Kyiv last week, the sources said. He expressed the US view that categorically ruling out any talks with Putin plays into the Russian leaders hand by fueling the Kremlin narrative that the Ukrainians are refusing to talk.\n\nOn Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is \"open to\" negotiation with Ukraine but \"at the moment we do not see such an opportunity, because Kyiv turned into a law [their decision] not to continue any negotiations.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that the US is urging Ukraine to appear open to talks.\n\nThe advice to the Ukrainians is also coming ahead of what could be a tough winter for Europe, which has already been experiencing soaring energy costs tied to Russias invasion and has warned of potential blackouts and gas rationing stemming from the energy crunch.\n\n\"I dont think theyre nave that now is the moment for talks. Just talking about talks more,\" a Western official told CNN, referring to the White House. \"They recognize that theres not any clear signal from the Russians that theyre open for serious negotiations.\"\n\n\"You can get everyone to agree on the principle, but the devil is in the details,\" the official added.\n\nBack in the US, Republicans have also begun to signal they might be less willing to support Ukraine financially and militarily should the GOP take back control of the House of Representatives.\n\n\"I think there has to be accountability going forward,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN. \"You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.\"\n\nSullivan has also spoken with Russian officials, including his Russian counterpart Nikolai Patrushev and Putins foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, about de-escalating the Kremlins rhetoric around the war, sources said, and the consequences should Russia move to use a nuclear weapon.\n\nUS not pushing Ukraine to negotiating table\n\nZelensky has said repeatedly over the last eight months of war that Ukraine is willing to engage in diplomatic talks with the Russians, and the US understands why he would not want to sit down with the man who is bombing his country daily. US officials have therefore not been trying to push Ukraine to the negotiating table, the sources said, especially because it is clear that Russia has not shown any willingness to negotiate, either.\n\nRather, the US more immediate goal has just been to try to get the Ukrainians to change their messaging strategy, the sources added, so that the country can maintain its international coalition of financial and military support for as long as necessary.\n\n\"The United States is going to be with Ukraine for as long as it takes in this fight,\" Sullivan said in Kyiv last week. \"There will be no wavering, no flagging, no flinching in our support as we go forward.\"\n\nAfter Sullivan left Kyiv, Zelensky said in his nightly remarks that \"we are ready for peace, for a fair and just peace, the formula of which we have voiced many times. The world knows our position. This is respect for the UN Charter, respect for our territorial integrity, respect for our people and due responsibility for terror - this is punishment for all those who are guilty and full compensation by Russia for the damage caused to us.\"\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said that any diplomatic solution needs to be worked out by Ukraine and Russia and refused to weigh in on what the negotiations could look like. But asked if there can be a diplomatic solution without regime change in Russia, Price said regime change is not the goal of the US, or that of the Ukrainians.\n\nThe discussions also come as some US officials question the ability of Ukraines armed forces to completely remove Russia from all of the areas it has occupied in Ukraine a concern the US has privately harbored for months.\n\nZelensky has stated that Kyivs goal is to liberate all of Ukraine, including Crimea, and Ukraines military has repeatedly exceeded most Western expectations. But Russia has been preparing defense lines designed to slow Ukrainian advances, and Ukraines counter-offensives in the east and the south are still relatively small compared to the size of the occupied areas, even though they have reclaimed thousands of square kilometers.\n\nThe swiftness of the initial advances has transitioned to a slower, more brutal battle along front lines that shift less and less by the week. And with winter fast approaching, a defense official says the battlefield is likely to become more static and less dynamic. That could create a window for diplomacy, as an outright military victory becomes increasingly unlikely for either Russia or Ukraine.\n\nThe outcome of the fighting around Kherson in southern Ukraine may become clear in the next two to three weeks, the official added.\n\nIt is not the first time that the US and Ukraine have disagreed over messaging about the war. US officials have urged Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, to appear more outwardly grateful for the aid they have received from the West.\n\nIn a phone call with US President Joe Biden in June to discuss another $1 billion US aid package to Ukraine, Zelensky listed the additional equipment and weapons that Ukraine still neededin response, Biden was \"direct\" with Zelensky about his belief that the US is already doing all it can to help the country, a source familiar with the conversation said.\n\nAs CNN has previously reported, moreover, tensions between Zelensky and Biden administration officials ran high in the weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, amid a disagreement over how to interpret and publicly communicate US intelligence assessments that said Russia could be preparing a large-scale attack on Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly today recommended Member States create an international register of damage to serve as a record of evidence and claims information.\n\nBy the terms of the text, titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" adopted by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions the Assembly recognized that the Russian Federation must be held to account for any violations of international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law in or against Ukraine. The Assembly further recognized the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury arising from the Russian Federations internationally wrongful acts.\n\nThe Assembly also reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine and demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from that countrys territory.\n\nMany delegates expressed their support for the establishment of a registry while others voiced their concern over the resolutions divisiveness and dangerous precedent in allowing the establishment of a mechanism that is not accountable to the Assembly. Several delegations spotlighted the hypocrisy and double standards of the resolutions sponsors.\n\nIntroducing the text (document A/ES-11/L.6), the representative of Ukraine noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he underscored while emphasizing that the resolution is concerned with ensuring an appropriate response that averts any aggressors temptation to start a war. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nAs an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery, the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the Assemblys authority, Guatemalas minister noted.\n\nIt is very straightforward, Albanias speaker explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability.\n\n\"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars,\" Polands speaker stressed.\n\n\"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" the Russian Federations delegate countered, noting that the United Nations would have no role in the establishment of a mechanism created by a group of States which will decide its functioning. The West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery intended to draw out the conflict. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations.\n\nElaborating on the texts flaws, the speaker for China noted that the invoked articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts have no legally binding status as the research products of the International Law Commission. The Assembly is not a judicial body, he stressed, while his colleague from Eritrea agreed on behalf of a group of like-minded countries. Its resolutions cannot go beyond its mandate and responsibilities to serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts, she emphasized. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she added.\n\nWill Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory?, that countrys speaker asked. What about Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine? he continued. Creating a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and well-documented demands is unjust, morally unacceptable and damaging to the Assemblys credibility, he emphasized.\n\nEchoing the concern over the \"message of exceptionalism\", the representative for South Africa pointed out the lack of clarity on the mechanisms composition and eventual legal status.\n\nAlso speaking today were the representatives of Latvia (on behalf of Nordic-Baltic countries), Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Australia, Canada, Slovakia, Italy, Ireland, Syria, Nicaragua, Romania, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, France, Netherlands, Belarus, Iran, the United States and the European Union, in its capacity as observer.\n\nAn observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also spoke.\n\nThe representatives of the Bahamas (on behalf of the Caribbean Community), Mexico, Venezuela, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Pakistan, Kenya, Brunei Darussalam, Argentina, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Bahrain spoke in explanation of vote.\n\nThe Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 15 November, to consider the election of members to the Committee for Programme and Coordination and appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences, the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the Joint Inspection Unit. The Assembly will also take up the related reports of those bodies and the reports of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary).\n\nIntroduction of Draft Resolution\n\nSERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ), introducing the draft resolution titled \"Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine\" (document A/ES-11/L.6), noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Today, the Russian Federation is doing everything it can to avoid paying the price for its own war and occupation, he said, before referencing that countrys words and stance on the creation of the United Nations Compensation Commission for any damage, loss or injury arising out of Iraqs unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait. From day one of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has thrown bombs, missiles and shells at Ukrainian cities and villages; destroyed roads, bridges and railways; demolished almost half of Ukraines power grid and utilities; and committed murder, rape, torture, forced deportation and looting. Ukraines recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federations war, he said, while urging the Assembly to hold that country accountable. The Russian Federation prefers impunity to accountability and knows only two things lies and veto when it comes to the Security Councils processes, he said.\n\nThe proposed resolution, he noted, calls for Member States to build the legitimate international infrastructure which addresses the consequences of the Russian Federations aggression against his country, records evidence of atrocities and preserves the hope for justice for millions whose lives have been forever changed. It is about an appropriate response which averts the temptation of any aggressor in starting a war, he emphasized. He then reaffirmed his countrys commitment to a transparent, impartial and objective process managed and overseen by the international community and expressed his hope for cooperation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in assessing damages. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned.\n\nMARIO ADOLFO BCARO FLORES, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala , said that, as a country that in its own history has experienced a lot of conflict, Guatemala acknowledges the importance of peace and respect for human rights. The draft resolution is a step towards reconciliation among the parties. Considering that the text includes civilian claims, it is an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery. As a country that strongly believes in multilateralism, Guatemala is convinced that the Assembly has the mandate and authority to adopt the draft, as set out in Chapter Four of the United Nations Charter. The language of the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the authority of the General Assembly. He called on all Member States to support the initiative, because \"it is the right thing to do\". The Assembly cannot remain paralyzed or inactive.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), offering to correct gaffes in Ukraines statement, called the draft resolution a classic example of a rules-based order in which a narrow group of States attempts to consecrate something that is illegal while also positioning the Assembly as a judicial body, which it is not. \"The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,\" he said, emphasizing that the draft resolution tries to legalize something which, from the point of view of international law, cannot be legalized. Moreover, if adopted, the text will have consequences for the co-sponsors which, like a boomerang, will go back on them. The \"so-called international mechanism\" would be created by a group of States that will decide its functioning and designate the guilty parties and the amount of reparations. The United Nations will play no role in that process, there will be no accountability to the Assembly and most Member States will have no right to any control over the mechanism, he added.\n\nThe Russian Federation has no doubt that the funds for damage compensation will be drawn from frozen, or rather stolen, Russian assets worth billions of dollars, he said, adding that the West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery that is intended to draw out the conflict. This will increase global tensions and instability, but the beneficiaries will be Western military corporations that have already made billions of dollars from the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Neither the Assembly nor any other mechanism can annul sovereignty immunity, which States assets have under international law, he emphasized. Those delegations which support the draft resolution will be implicated in the illegal expropriation of sovereignty assets. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations, as the draft resolution is being put forward by States with a rich record of looting the rest of the world through colonialism, slavery and the exploitation of natural resources. The countries of the West never considered reparations as a way of atoning for their own sins, he said, adding that if adopted, the draft resolution will have systemic consequences for the Organization.\n\nOLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, recalled how, on 2 March, the General Assembly with an overwhelming majority confirmed that the Russian Federation committed an aggression against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. \"Damage inflicted on Ukraine is huge,\" he said. Under international law, the responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful act. The draft resolution recommends the creation by Member States and Ukraine of a register of damage. That register will serve as a repository of evidence of all types of damage.\n\nThe resolution also recognizes the need for the establishment of an international claims mechanism for reparation for damage as a second step, he continued. Rather than charging the domestic legal system of Ukraine and other States with a potentially very high number of individual litigations, a centralized and specialized system would be more appropriate. \"Russia must be held to account for its wrongful acts and wanton destruction,\" he stressed. Every country enjoys the right to document crimes committed against its population, territory or cultural property in order to secure a proper investigation.\n\nSOPHIA TESFAMARIAM ( Eritrea ), speaking on behalf of a Group of Like-Minded Countries, stressed that the Assembly is not a judicial body. Its resolutions represent the political will of States and can in no way serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts as such an action would go beyond its mandate and responsibilities, she said. As such, the draft resolution does not have sufficient legal basis, is not in line with the established practice and would only promote a divisive agenda within the Assembly. The texts adoption, she warned, would set a dangerous precedent that would allow for the Assemblys \"blessing\" to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed nor accountable to the organ responsible for creating it. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she noted.\n\nAs national positions must be respected, the Assembly must play a positive role in ensuring the conflict in Ukraine is resolved through diplomatic efforts and means while avoiding any initiative that might further aggravate the situation on the ground and escalate tensions, she emphasized. Sovereign States must not be forced to take specific sides in the conflict. Any attempt to entrench a cold warera mentality and block politics based on confrontation, deepening divisions and the imposition of disparate visions and agendas must be rejected by all, she urged.\n\nANDREJS PILDEGOVIS ( Latvia ), speaking on behalf of the eight NordicBaltic countries, recalled that the Russian Federations brutal invasion has created Europes largest humanitarian tragedy since World War II. More than 17 million people have been displaced, while three million must get by without water, electricity, sanitation and heating. Russian armed forces have deliberately attacked critical infrastructure, including energy grids, power interconnectors and water stations. Collecting and preserving evidence is important because the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its internationally wrongful acts against Ukraine and its people, he emphasized.\n\nHe quoted the President of Ukraine as having told journalists a few hours earlier that investigators had uncovered more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson area after it was abandoned by Russian forces. There must be no impunity for these crimes and perpetrators must be held to account. Reiterating the NordicBaltic countries firm support for Ukraine, he urged the Russian Federation to abide by international law and uphold its international commitments. He also called for the SecretaryGeneral and the United Nations to continue efforts to restore respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.\n\nKRZYSZTOF SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) underscored the need for an unambiguous and comprehensive response from the international community. As accountability must remain the priority as the war continues, the Russian Federation must be held responsible for the consequences of all its violations, including reparations for the injury and damage caused by its glaring and largescale violation of its international obligations, he stressed. Poland supports the creation of an international register of damage, he said while calling for all damages to be always and appropriately compensated. \"It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars\", he stressed. The proposed register, he continued, will not only assist Ukraine in rebuilding itself but will also bring justice to the victims of the Russian Federations barbaric acts.\n\nMOHAN MAITHRI PIERIS ( Sri Lanka ), noting that the most urgent step is to engage in talks for a ceasefire, stressed that an attempt to provide justification through a General Assembly resolution to seizure sovereign assets of one party would amount to an overreach of the application of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Further pointing out that the Assembly is a political body for deliberation, he underscored that it cannot determine State responsibility or usurp the sovereign immunity of State property under international law. Highlighting that the register initiative creates a dangerous precedent, he emphasized that it may result in compelling the parties to resort to a more lethal and sophisticated method of engaging in the conflict.\n\nABDULAZIZ M. ALWASIL ( Saudi Arabia ), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the Council is very concerned with the crisis in Ukraine and its humanitarian, economic and political consequences. The Council aligns itself with the fundamental principles of respect for international law and the United Nations Charter that govern relations between countries, he said, urging all parties to respect their obligations under international law. The best course is to reach a settlement by diplomatic means that serves the interests of all parties. The draft resolution is based on the main principles and guidelines of redress adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 147/60 in 2005, he noted, adding that any mechanism must be based on procedures and standards that are internally accepted and under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide redress and reparations in a fair manner. He expressed the Councils hope of finding a satisfactory solution and supported all humanitarian initiatives that achieve this purpose and bring peace to the region.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) spotlighted the continued damage and loss to Ukraine and its people caused by the Russian Federations unprovoked and illegal invasion. The scenes of relief and joy as Ukrainian civilians in Kherson greet Ukraines liberating armed forces, she noted, should leave the international community with no doubt about the cruel and destructive nature of the Russian Federations invasion. It will take a broad international effort to support Ukraines recovery and construction in order to build a safe and prosperous future for its people, she continued. Only one country is responsible for the damage to Ukraine, must pay for that damage and must be held to account for actions that are in clear violation of international law, she said before expressing her support for establishing a register of damage as an important first step towards justice.\n\nISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ) recalled that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime and that responsibility for these actions must be held. \"Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force must not occur in any corner of the globe,\" he said, adding that the draft resolution, if adopted, should contribute to reparations for the serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Russian Federation must immediately stop its war of aggression, withdraw all its troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and respect Ukraines independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he added.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ) said that it is the General Assemblys responsibility \"to do all we can\" to avoid the deadly consequences of war. \"We see accountability and reparation processes as an important element in avoiding and forestalling further perpetuation of grave atrocities,\" she added. New Zealand is strongly committed to supporting international mechanisms that seek accountability for the Russian Federations clear breaches of international law. In addition to mechanisms that seek accountability, New Zealand believes that future reparation processes can play a critical role in the rebuilding of communities, he said. Those that are responsible for causing damage and injury by breaching international law must make full reparations for rebuilding and compensating Ukraine. \"The principles at stake in Ukraine are deeply significant to New Zealand as a small State acting in the world,\" she said, urging the Russian Federation to commit to dialogue and act in the interests of peace.\n\nDANG HOANG GIANG ( Viet Nam ) expressed concern over recent developments in the situation in Ukraine, with few prospects for an early resolution. \"We cannot let cooperation and dialogue take the back seat,\" he emphasized. While noting the importance of resolving the \"war legacies\" for reconstruction, maintenance of peace, stability and prosperity for the livelihoods of the people of Ukraine, he stressed that the immediate task is to respond adequately to the urgent humanitarian needs of those impacted by hostilities in the country. He further pointed out that the international community should refrain from actions that may drive the parties further apart and delay the prospects of a peaceful settlement.\n\nMITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ), emphasizing that \"we will not be fooled by Russias misinformation and obfuscation,\" said the draft resolution does not overstep the Assemblys powers in any way. Rather, it simply recognizes fundamental principles of international law by which all States, including the Russian Federation, must abide. A register of damage and a reparations mechanism, appropriately constructed, will be an important component of a fair, impartial and just framework for determining the reparations that the Russian Federation must make to ensure lasting peace. He urged all Member States to continue to support this and all other efforts to ensure that the Russian Federation ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and to make reparations for the injury and damage it has caused.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ) spotlighted the Russian Federations footprint of destruction. While the United Nations and other organizations have reported continuously on the significant and widespread damages caused by the Russian Federations aggression, there is a need to have a detailed map of what has happened to have a full picture of this man-made catastrophe, he emphasized. In expressing his support for the resolution, he called on all Member States to vote in favour as an act of justice and dignity. It is very straightforward, he explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability. The Russian Federation must silence the guns, withdraw completely and unconditionally from Ukraine and engage in negotiations. \"Ukraine is home to Ukrainians. It does not have to become the graveyard of Russian soldiers,\" he said.\n\nROBERT KEITH RAE ( Canada ) said the resolution is not about seizing assets or dealing with State sovereignty; rather, it is about saying there must be a registry for there to be an eventual reckoning for the damage and destruction that has been caused. When one country attacks another country, it is a breach of the law, and it is against the rules. The Russian Federation has prevented the Security Council from functioning and has tried to tie up the General Assembly and the Council in knots because it cannot bring itself to admit that its Special Military Operation is not that at all but rather a systematic attack on Ukraine. The Russian Federation is attempting to freeze and starve the people of Ukraine. \"Of course, we need to find peace,\" he said, but the one and only country that can secure peace refuses to accept responsibility for its own aggression. The Assembly is not being asked to perform the function of judge or jury or to go too far, it is simply saying there should be a registry and Ukraine and other countries should be allowed to support that registry.\n\nMICHAL MLYNR ( Slovakia ), associating himself with the European Union, and recalling the Assemblys demand for the Russian Federation to cease its aggression against Ukraine and to withdraw from its internationally recognized borders, said today is an opportunity to address Moscows second obligation under customary international law. He asked delegates to imagine that their countries neighbour had launched a brutal and illegitimate military aggression that resulted in enormous damage against them. Would they not want the international community to hold the aggressor to account with an obligation to pay reparations, he wondered. \"I believe the answer is clear,\" he said, urging delegates to vote in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nMAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, said that, despite strong condemnations, the Russian Federations violent actions continue to cause suffering and destruction in Ukraine. \"The picture that is emerging after Russias recent withdrawal from Kherson is once again one of destruction and pain inflicted on the local population,\" he said. The draft resolution does not establish any standing United Nations reparation or compensation mechanism. It is instead aimed at providing global legitimacy by recommending to Member States the creation of an international register of damage. Such register will coordinate and organize evidencegathering efforts, including those carried out in the context of various investigations by United Nations bodies. \"Ukraine needs reparations to have the possibility of rebuilding itself after the war housing for its people, schools, hospitals, roads, railways and bridges, as well as its industry and power grid all that was destroyed by Russia during its invasion and occupation,\" he added.\n\nFERGAL MYTHEN ( Ireland ), associating himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation faces legal consequences arising from its continued breaches of international law. Explaining that the draft resolution recognizes and affirms Moscows clear obligation to cease its wrongful acts and to make reparations, he said that an international register of damage would not only preserve evidence of damage, loss and injury but also shed light on atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people. It would be an important first step towards accountability, he said, adding that reparations will alleviate some of the longterm consequences of this horrific war.\n\nBASSAM SABBAGH ( Syria ), aligning himself with the Group of LikeMinded Countries, pointed out that \"Western countries\" are promoting political polarization within the United Nations to deepen the divide among its Member States. He stressed that the organ should avoid any initiative which exacerbates the conflict and prevents its peaceful resolution. Noting that the draft resolution is part of a series of \"unbalanced bias and provocative resolutions\" pushed by the United States and its Western partners, he stated that its real objective is to pay for the increasing purchases of weapons by Ukraine. In this regard he asked the Assembly: \"Who will compensate my country for the destruction of the Syrian infrastructure by the socalled international coalition?\"\n\nJASSER JIMNEZ ( Nicaragua ), echoing the statement of the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the resolution is an example of the hypocrisy and double standards of certain countries. Nicaragua supports a robust multilateralism and a new international order with a deep transformation between countries, he said, calling for an end to double standards and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution shamelessly seeks to politicize the Organization by setting up an international mechanism that is not administered by the body that established it, he said. This is a mechanism for a single case and ignores the painful history that imperialist countries have left behind. It does not recognize the genocide against the original peoples of countries. He supported his brethren in the Caribbean and Africa that are seeking reparations for these losses. Sanctions are direct aggressions against people, and during the pandemic, they have become crimes against humanity, he said, calling for reparations for damage caused by Western countries. He said that in 1986 the International Court of Justice condemned the United States for hostilities against Nicaragua and ordered $17 billion in compensation. It is a decision that the United States has not complied with. Developing countries have been demanding a reparation mechanism for the damage created by climate change. The resolution is a divisive act in the Assembly and does not promote dialogue. It sets a dangerous precedent as it is not administered by the Assembly and his delegation will vote against it.\n\nCORNEL FERU ( Romania ), aligning himself with the European Union, said the resolution is an additional step towards accountability for the Russian Federations blatant violations of international law. Its provisions, he noted, complement existing international efforts concerning individual criminal responsibility by adding the missing dimension of the States responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts. Ukraines case for reparations, he continued, is a moral and legal imperative which constitutes an important deterrent to the benefit of the entire community. If the aggressor is left unsanctioned, this could lead to an irreversible decay of the international order which generations have strived to build in the aftermath of the world wars, he warned. As its provisions do not establish any new entities, the resolution undertakes a modest and principled step by recognizing the need for an international mechanism for reparation and recommending the creation of an international register of damage, he emphasized.\n\nSONG KIM ( Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea ) stressed that the draft resolution is \"nothing more than a politically motivated document\" to shift all responsibilities of the crisis in Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Pointing out that the text is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, he further noted that the Assembly is not a judicial organ and has no mandate to judge the internationally wrongful acts and to provide the legal ground for remedy and reparations. Voicing concern over the possibility of abusing this draft resolution as a basis to illegally seize property and assets of a sovereign State, he opposed the text as a \"product of a unilateral and double standard practice.\"\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) said that the draft resolution contains obvious flaws and loopholes. Elaborating, he said that the Assembly is not an international judicial body, and therefore it cannot define or hold accountable international wrongful acts. Moreover, the draft resolution aims to invoke articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, but these articles are only the research products of the International Law Commission, an expert body, and they are not legally binding. In addition, creating a register of damage outside the framework of the United Nations is a diversion from past practice that makes no sense and has no precedent. Such draft resolutions should be subjected to full consultations with a view to achieving a consensus that can stand the test of history. Regrettably, the co-sponsors of this text did not organize consultations in earnest, pushing instead for the Assembly to take unconstructive, hasty action. Declaring that China will vote against the draft resolution, he called on the parties to the crisis to return to dialogue and negotiation, with the Assembly working actively towards that end instead of aggravating divisions.\n\nNATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ), associating herself with the European Union, reiterated her countrys commitment to Ukraine and its people in ensuring justice for all victims of the Russian Federations illegal war. Victims must be respected in terms of their dignity and rights, she emphasized while spotlighting her countrys support for Ukraine legal actions and to the international efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. As the Russian Federation must be held responsible for its crimes, its flagrant violations of international law and the legal consequences of its wrongful actions, she called on the Assembly to support the draft resolution.\n\nMATHU JOYINI ( South Africa ) said that the impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt all over the world. South Africa reiterates that the territorial integrity of all States, including that of Ukraine, must be respected and rejects all actions that undermine principles laid out in the United Nations Charter. The Security Council should play a constructive role in resolving this conflict, she added, expressing regret that the Council continues to fail the people of Ukraine. The General Assembly, for its part, should create conditions conducive to dialogue, mediation and diplomacy. That, after all, is the only path to peace. The United Nations should do more to devote equal time to the resolution of all conflict situations that threaten international peace and security. She expressed concern that the General Assembly was \"sending a message of exceptionalism\" and that reparations matter in some situations but not others. Member States must refrain from double standards. The draft resolution places the United Nations in uncharted waters. The General Assembly is being asked to grant its authority to the setting up of a reparations mechanism, but there is no clarity on what the mechanism will look like or what its eventual legal status will be. \"We are uncomfortable\" with the draft text, she said, noting that South Africa will abstain from todays vote.\n\nYOKA BRANDT ( Netherlands ), aligning herself with the European Union, stressed that the evidence of damages caused by the Russian Federation might disappear or get lost under the fog of war, therefore pointing to the need for a registry as outlined in the draft resolution. The text establishes that the aggressor is liable for the damages, she added, which must be documented in a register to allow for compensations. Recalling that the Assembly has established a register for damages in the past, she underscored that it is within its competence to recommend establishing one for this case. She called on Member States to \"vote for justice for all those who have suffered damages in the unprovoked conflict\".\n\nVALENTIN RYBAKOV ( Belarus ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the draft resolution introduced today once again shows that Western States have given up on principles of multilateralism and cooperation with the United Nations. Through the Minsk agreements, his delegation did all it could to organize negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Yet the Western States, the guarantors, did not really want to have the situation resolved, he said. Instead, they endorsed the fomenting escalation in the Donbas region in 2014, supported Ukraine and pumped weapons into it, creating the pre-conditions for todays situation, in which both countries have become an existential threat to each other. The draft does not stand up to the cross-scrutiny of international law. It does not mention the crimes of imperialists and the consequences of slavery, he said, pointing out that no one has paid reparations for these types of damages, which are not even possible to assess. The draft does not mention the economic terrorism of sanctions that suffocate whole peoples. The war in Ukraine is one of 30 armed conflicts in the world. The Assembly should not make an exemption for one country, he stressed. The text will not bring the situation one step closer to peace; it will just polarize the Assembly. As such, his delegation will vote against it, he said.\n\nPEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA ( Cuba ), calling on all parties to protect civilians, their property and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, rejected the double standards, partiality, discriminatory selectivity and opportunistic approaches before the Assembly. Spotlighting the hypocrisy of its main promoters, he urged States to listen and address the compensation claims of Caribbean Community (CARICOM), developing countries and small island developing States among others. The Assembly, he noted, has never established a reparations mechanism for Member States suffering from unilateral coercive measures. Will Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory, he asked before turning his attention to Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine. To limit and accelerate the creation of a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and welldocumented demands is unjust and morally unacceptable, he said. It also severely damages the Assemblys credibility, he added.\n\nAMIR SAEID JALIL IRAVANI ( Iran ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, noted that the draft resolution contains language outside of the Assemblys purview. If agreed upon, the proposed mechanism would have no actual contribution to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and would only serve as a political tool, he cautioned. The main sponsors of the draft resolution, he explained, apply different criteria in other conflicts in a blatant double standard. If an international mechanism is to be established, then it must have a broad mandate that could address any international wrongdoing, including military aggressions, looting, blockades, unilateral sanctions, occupation and the provision of weapons of mass destruction, he contended. Objecting to any mechanism which undermines international law, he pointed out that any acts or decisions of the mechanism in operative paragraphs 3 or 4 would have no legal status and thus be null and void.\n\nRICHARD M. MILLS, JR. ( United States ) said that it is clear what the issue is before the Assembly, namely that the international community must hold the Russian Federation to account for its violations of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the ensuing damage and abuses. \"This resolution represents a critical step towards accountability,\" he said, describing as tremendous the mounting cost of the Russian Federations unprovoked and unlawful invasion of its neighbour and fellow United Nations member. Pointing to Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter, he said that it is well within the Assemblys authority to adopt the draft resolution and create a damages register that will be an important first step towards a claims adjudication mechanism. This is a matter of justice, not geopolitical competition, and by adopting the text, the Assembly will send a strong message to would-be aggressors worldwide that violations of international law, including the Charter, will have consequences. A vote in favour of the draft resolution is a vote for accountability and for the defence of the Charter, he said, emphasizing that Member States cannot sit on the sidelines when fundamental principles of international law are at stake.\n\nSILVA LEANDER, representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance , in its capacity as observer, pointed out that Ukraine will require assistance for further strengthening its democratic institutions, which will be essential for successfully countering corruption and achieving its reconstruction. Noting that the Russian Federation has targeted not only strategic military infrastructure but also civilian targets, public services, supply networks and sectors, she stressed the need to include political and civil society institutions and actors at the local level in Ukraine as \"critical infrastructure\". Emphasizing that the coming process of reconstitution and recovery needs to place democracy at its centre, she deemed it vital to allocate resources to support the reconstruction and improvement of the countrys democratic institutions.\n\nAction\n\nThe representative of Bahamas , speaking on behalf of CARICOM in explanation of vote before the vote, said CARICOM subscribes to the principle that for every wrong, there is a remedy. This is a fundamental principle of law and equity and an equally fundamental principle of international law. Ukraine has experienced injury and the burden of compensation should be imposed on the perpetrator. CARICOM recognizes that the United Nations is vital to resolving international matters. While supporting Ukraines legitimate claims for reparations, he said such a process must be pursued through an appropriate mechanism. The proposal in the resolution contemplates that the Assembly should endorse a process over which it would have no control, oversight or any role. As drafted, the resolution asks Member States to give approval and then trust the process will be continued fairly and objectively.\n\nReferring to language in operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, he said CARICOM will abstain from a vote. Yet the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all its wrongful acts for any violations of international law and/or for any violations of international humanitarian law in or against Ukraine. He reiterated his strong support for the principle that Member States have a legitimate right to claim reparations and compensation for injury, loss and damage caused by the wrongful actions of other Member States. This principle is to be applied in the present case as well as other similar cases worldwide. CARICOM has made this broader point regarding several issues before the international community, including climate action and reparations in connection with the transatlantic slave trade and native genocide. \"There will always exist a moral and/or legal obligation to correct injustice including the legacy of past injustice,\" he said.\n\nThe representative of Mexico , reiterating his countrys defence of Ukraines sovereignty, national unity, independence and territorial integrity, noted the ongoing judicial processes which could lead to the establishment of reparation mechanisms. The reparations stage is still far away, he pointed out, since the conflict is ongoing and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, he said he will vote in favour of the resolution since the resolution limits itself to recommending the creation of a register of damages.\n\nJOAQUN PREZ ( Venezuela ), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, rejected attempts to impose a draft resolution that does not receive any consultations or take into account the views of all States involved. Such a methodology will not bring the international community closer to its goal of achieving peace. Rather, it will bring the Assembly closer to a point of no return. The draft resolution represents double standards and is not a peaceful solution. It attempts to use the Assembly to confiscate the properties and assets of other States and advances dubious aims. He said his country knows first-hand the looting of its sovereign resources. The text does not include measures for accountability, and there are no details on how it would be implemented. It does not follow a rules-based order. The proponents of the draft are shamelessly ignoring the crimes committed by colonial powers. The same members taking the lead on the resolution ignore the developing worlds demand for reparations. \"It is moral amnesia,\" he said. He appealed to other delegations to vote against the text, which would create a serious precedent for the Assembly.\n\nThe Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions.\n\nThe representative of Egypt , in explanation of vote after the vote, noted that he abstained from the vote since the proposal sets a dangerous precedent in asking for the development of a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the United Nations without clarifying the mechanisms rules, working methods or subsequent measures. The role of the Organization and the Assembly has unprecedentedly not been specified, he added. He then turned his attention to the divergent views on the International Law Commissions draft articles. This topic should not have been considered before the achievement of consensus in the Sixth Committee(Legal), he emphasized. In noting the double standard approach of certain States, he expressed his preference for the Assembly to abstain. The Assembly, he cautioned, must undertake a coherent approach going forward on its practices, ability and willingness to create similar reparation mechanisms for other countries.\n\nThe representative of Brazil said he abstained since the resolution does not foster constructive dialogue nor recognize the central role of the United Nations in the process. The text brings a high level of uncertainty regarding the legal parameters of such a register to be created outside the framework of the United Nations and without its supervision, he noted. In recommending the creation of such a mechanism without a specified scope, the Assembly is encouraging the fragmentation of its collective responsibility in promoting peace. It undermines the United Nations and ignores the efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, he emphasized before voicing his regret over the insufficient time for discussion. The emergency special session must be capable of acting in a more transparent and democratic fashion, he urged while referencing the deadlock in the Security Council.\n\nThe representative of Chile said her countrys vote in favour of the resolution is representative of its respect for human rights. She also expressed concern that some delegations in the Sixth Committee (Legal) have been unwilling to negotiate a convention on a binding framework to provide legal certainty regarding the international responsibility of States. Chile calls on those delegations to modify their position. Chile also recognizes that Assembly resolutions have a non-binding character. Further, she said she hopes a reparations fund will be established for relatives of victims of femicide and other violent deaths of women. Chile calls on all parties to continue negotiations and find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia called the resolution \"divisive\", while also recognizing the efforts of the facilitators to provide room for some consultation. The underlying message of the resolution should have been that war must stop and that sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. On the recommendation to establish a registry of damage and a reparations mechanism, he highlighted that such mechanisms must be built upon a foundation of due process. \"The General Assembly resolution at this stage may lead us to a slippery slope,\" he warned. For these reasons, Indonesia abstained from the resolution.\n\nThe representative of India , emphasizing the conflicts impact on the Global South, said delegations need to consider whether a reparation process, initiated through the Assembly, will contribute to resolving the conflict. Such a mechanism must not be established without adequate legal vetting, she said, adding that Member States must avoid steps that might preclude or endanger the possibility of dialogue and negotiations which could bring the conflict to an end. For that reason, India decided to abstain, she said.\n\nThe representative of Singapore said his delegation supported the resolution on the understanding that it is without prejudice to, nor does it seek to undermine or prejudge, the outcomes of ongoing judicial and investigative processes related to the war in Ukraine. Moreover, in Singapores view, the approach contained in the resolution is not automatically applicable to other conflicts, as every situation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law into account, he added.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan , noting that while his country supports the establishment of a claims commission, stressed that any such mechanism must be based on sound legal foundations. Double standards in the application of international law are counterproductive, he emphasized, underscoring that it would be unprecedented to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed by nor accountable to any of the United Nations principal organs, including the Assembly. Irrespective of the origin of the conflict, he added, the highest priority at this moment is immediate cessation of hostilities and dialogue for peace.\n\nThe representative of Kenya stated that, while Ukraine has a sovereign right to make claims for damages and losses caused by the current conflict, so do all peoples and countries that have sought reparations for colonial violence, slavery and other acts of aggression. Noting that this text will pave the way for more concrete discussions, decisions and resolutions on reparation, he emphasized that all Member States should be ready to hear other countries calls for accountability for historical injustices.\n\nThe representative of Brunei Darussalam condemned violations of the sovereignty or territorial integrity of any country and firmly upheld the principles for the respect of international law. Regarding the establishment of a register of damage, she said similar mechanisms have been established under the ambit of the United Nations. Any such independent mechanism should be established according to due process and consultations. She reiterated the importance of diplomacy and called on all parties directly involved to deescalate and resolve the situation by peaceful means, stressing the need to refrain from force and maintain international peace and stability.\n\nThe representative of Argentina said her delegations clear and consistent position has been to defend territorial integrity as a fundamental principle of international law. Any damages must be subject to reparations under international law. She supported the draft resolution as it would achieve accountability for wrongful acts that violate the Charter. She stressed the importance of indicating the damages for such wrongful acts and discussing appropriate means for accountability, bearing in mind that accountability for unlawful acts must apply to all acts that need reparations, without prejudice. For this reason, her delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution.\n\nThe representative of Qatar , in calling on parties to show restraint and stop the war, said he voted in favour of the resolution since it is in line with his countrys position on the protection of civilians and the provision of reparations for material and psychological damages. Reparations and the mechanisms to implement them, however, must be conducted in accordance with the principles of international law and established international precedents, he stressed.\n\nThe representative of the United Arab Emirates , associating himself with the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he abstained due to the texts unclear and imprecise nature. The resolution offers the Assemblys support for reparations and evidentiary processes that have yet to be defined by a group of Member States still to be determined, he pointed out while expressing his concern over the resolutions implications for sovereign equality and sovereign immunity.\n\nThe representative of Nigeria called on all parties to the conflict to end hostilities and begin negotiations. Nigeria is committed to the principles of the United Nations and calls on all countries to refrain from actions that will worsen the conflict. Current efforts should focus on resuming peace. Nigeria is open to working with all countries on these goals, he said, adding that for such reasons Nigeria abstained from the vote.\n\nThe representative of Sierra Leone reiterated grave concern about the conflict in Ukraine, which has had widespread repercussions all over the world. Sierra Leone is committed to the United Nations Charter and its principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, he said. Noting that his delegations prior votes on the issue of Ukraine have been based on the Charter principles, he said today Sierra Leone abstained from the resolution and was guided by its belief in the Charter and the consistent application of international law. The General Assembly is not an adjudicative body and cannot set out legal consequences; it must recognize all victims of historical injustices, including racism, colonialism and slavery. \"Reparations concern both the past and the present,\" he added.",

                "cc_text": "Opposition agreed on schedule for primaries ahead of 2024 polls, govt suffered diplomatic setbacks at UN human rights council, and U.S. imposed new laws to curb Venezuelan migration.\n\nOpposition agreed on timetable for primaries, but faced challenge at Organization of American States (OAS). Amid claims that Mexico talks between govt and opposition alliance Unitary Platform could soon resume, Platform representatives mid-Oct met in Panama with head of U.S. Venezuela Affairs Unit Ambassador James Story. According to 14 Oct report by Reuters news agency, opposition leaders agreed to hold primaries in June 2023 ahead of 2024 presidential election. However, 19 Oct communiqu outlining rules for primaries did not mention enlisting collaboration of National Electoral Council, suggesting participation could be severely curtailed due to inadequate technical capabilities; participation could also be limited as most members of Venezuelan diaspora, now around seven mn, will not be able to participate due to onerous conditions for registration and lack of access to consulates.

The lawsuit, which follows a similar complaint filed Friday by various civil rights groups, argues that a provision in state law requiring mail-in ballots to include the date on the outside of mail-in ballot envelopes violates federal law.

McCarthy spoke to CNN the same day he rallied for a trio of Hispanic GOP women who are running to represent key districts along the southern border. McCarthy also said oversight and investigations would be a key priority for a GOP-majority House, which potentially includes probes into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Biden administrations withdrawal from Afghanistan. He also left open the possibility of launching potential impeachment proceedings that some of his members have pushed for. Additionally, McCarthy reiterated his vow to reinstate Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to her committee assignments after Democrats last year voted to revoke them following incendiary remarks that mused over the execution of Democratic lawmakers. Greene previously indicated that she wants a seat on the House Oversight Committee. \"Shes going to have committees to serve on, just like every other member,\" McCarthy told CNN. He added, \"Members request different committees, and as we go through the Steering Committee, well look at it.\" Share this -\n\nCopied\n\nBiden and Trump to deliver closing pitches at rallies Monday night On the eve of the midterm elections, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are scheduled to deliver their closing pitches to voters at rallies Monday night.

The state's Supreme Court earlier this month ordered that county elections boards refrain from counting any absentee and mail-in ballots received that contained undated or incorrectly dated outer envelopes.

Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has made the case in internal meetings that the Ukrainians have achieved about as much as they could reasonably expect on the battlefield before winter sets in and so they should try to cement their gains at the bargaining table, according to officials informed about the discussions.\n\nBut other senior officials have resisted the idea, maintaining that neither side is ready to negotiate and that any pause in the fighting would only give President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a chance to regroup. While Mr. Bidens advisers believe the war will likely be settled through negotiations eventually, officials said, they have concluded that the moment is not ripe and the United States should not be seen as pressuring the Ukrainians to hold back while they have momentum.\n\nThe debate, which the officials described on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive deliberations, has spilled out into public in recent days as General Milley made public comments hinting at his private advice. \"Seize the moment,\" he said in a speech in New York on Wednesday.",

Nor do they expect Washington's support for Kyiv to dip significantly anytime soon.\n\nInstead, with an eye on the next U.S. presidential election in 2024 and the resilience of a geopolitical foe whose moment in the historical sun they believe is coming to an end, pro-Kremlin Russians hope the results will be disputed and that the American political system will face fresh turmoil in coming years.\n\nTheir stance reflects President Vladimir Putin's own belief that Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, something he calls a \"special military operation\", is part of an historical realignment away from a U.S.-dominated world to a multipolar one where the views of countries like Russia and China must be reckoned with.\n\n\"A Republican victory in the U.S. congressional elections will not lead to a revolution in U.S. foreign policy and an end to Washington's support for Ukraine,\" Alexei Pushkov, a hawkish Russian senator and foreign policy specialist, wrote on the Telegram messaging service.\n\n\"However, the Biden administration will find it more difficult to push financial aid programmes to Kyiv through Congress, and the position of U.S. critics of unlimited aid to Ukraine will markedly strengthen.\"\n\nPushkov, who had sanctions placed upon him by the European Union in March for voting to support Moscow's Ukraine policy, said he thought there was a chance that Republicans might target what he called Biden's \"wasteful\" Ukraine spending in the run-up to 2024 to try to hurt the Democrats' ratings.\n\nBut a report drawn up by the Moscow-based Institute for International Studies, which shares its research with the Russian Foreign Ministry and other state bodies, concluded that the mood of what it called the U.S. establishment and the electorate meant the elections were unlikely to bring about major changes to Washington's Ukraine policy.\n\nUkraine has rarely come up as a key voter concern, with those polled ahead of the election citing mostly worries on domestic issues like inflation, crime and abortion.\n\n'CRITICAL JUNCTURE'\n\nRussian ultra-nationalist circles were more certain that the midterms - in which Republicans are forecast to win control of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate - would be positive for their long-term interests.\n\nTsargrad, an online news portal and TV station funded by sanctioned Russian ultra-nationalist tycoon Konstantin Malofeev, predicted the elections would ultimately be America's undoing.\n\n\"At a critical juncture in world history, this election could have a major impact on the geopolitical environment, and Ukraine in particular,\" it wrote.\n\n\"But it could also be the detonator of domestic centrifugal processes that could end the United States as we know it today,\" it said, talking of the theoretical possibility of civil war due to political polarisation and distrust of election outcomes.\n\nIf such a dramatic scenario unfolded, Washington, Tsargrad predicted, would not have the capacity to keep prosecuting its Ukraine policy.\n\nIn a column for the state-run RIA news agency, columnist Pyotr Akopov also forecast that Russia would be the real winner of the U.S. midterms because the vote would deepen political divisions ahead of the 2024 presidential election which he predicted would be disputed.\n\n\"Even if it survives as a single state, the United States will change dramatically and its global position will weaken under any circumstances,\" Akopov opined.\n\n\"Confrontation with China will require the mobilisation of all of the country's global resources - and attention to Europe will inevitably weaken,\" he said. \"Without a strong and united (United) States the West will not be able to maintain control over western Russian lands for long.\"\n\nEditing by Rosalba O'Brien\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Mikhail Klimentyev | Afp | Getty Images\n\nWhile the U.S. midterm election results roll in, and point to a far tighter-than-expected race between Republicans and Democrats as they vie for control of Congress, the vote is being closely watched in Ukraine and Russia with both gauging how the election could impact the war and geopolitics. Although it has not commented publicly, Moscow is seen to favor a win for the Republicans in the midterms in the hope that a big power shift could bring about a change in the U.S.' foreign policy toward Ukraine and could deepen rumblings of discontent among Republicans over the massive financial support the U.S. is giving Kyiv to fight Russia. Nine months into the ongoing conflict and the Biden administration has now committed more than $18.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Department of Defense's latest figures. There are some signs that bipartisan support for such immense and ongoing aid could be waning, however, with prominent Republicans starting to question how long the U.S.' largesse can continue, particularly against a backdrop of inflation, potential recession and rising living costs. For one, prominent Republican Kevin McCarthy said in an interview in October there would be no \"blank check\" for Ukraine if the Republicans win a majority in the House of Representatives in the midterms.\n\nShift in power ... and Ukraine support?\n\nRussia could well hope that a shift in power after the the midterm elections could herald a cooler attitude toward Ukraine. But analysts say Moscow could be disappointed unless former leader Donald Trump is able to return to power, having signaled he could announce next week a plan to run for the presidency again in 2024. \"There's no significant downside pressure on U.S. military support for Ukraine through the end of 2023,\" Ian Bremmer, founder and head of the Eurasia Group consultancy, said in emailed comments this week. \"Further, most Republicans remain staunchly committed to Ukraine support, despite House minority leader Kevin McCarthy's announcement of 'no blank check' for the Ukrainians under a Republican-led House. The GOP congressional position, at least near-term, will be 'the U.S. gives military aid, the Europeans give financial aid,' which changes little on the ground,\" he added.\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin listens while then-U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in Helsinki, Finland, in 2019. Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe bigger question comes from Trump announcing his presidential run, Bremmer said, adding that he expected such an announcement imminently. That, he added, was likely to be accompanied by blaming Biden for the war with a populist opposition to billions of taxpayer dollars being spent on Ukraine, a position that \"will gain momentum with MAGA supporters in Congress and undermine longer-term U.S. alignment with NATO allies,\" he noted. The U.S. has sought to calm any nerves in Kyiv about a shift in Washington's attitude toward the country with Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, making clear \"that the United States' commitment to Ukraine is unwavering\" when she met Ukraine's president on Tuesday.\n\nMoscow's bad reputation\n\nMoscow has earned itself a dubious reputation when it comes to U.S. democratic processes, found to have interfered in the 2016 election and suspected of continuing to sow political discord and in the country. Russia has done little to dispel doubts over its involvement in a string of nefarious activities in recent years, from alleged cyberattacks to disinformation campaigns aimed at swaying U.S. voters and elections. Putin's close confidante Yevgeny Prigozhin, an increasingly powerful oligarch who leads a state-backed private military group fighting in Ukraine, known as the Wagner Group as well as several companies implicated in 2016 U.S. election interference openly alluded to interfering in the U.S. midterms this week. \"We have interfered [in U.S. elections], we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do,\" Prigozhin said in comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia's Facebook equivalent VKontakte.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group, claimed in May that his mercenary fighters captured Bakhmut after nine months of intense fighting there. Mikhail Svetlov | Getty Images\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price on Monday said that the Biden administration was not surprised by Prigozhin's admission, telling a briefing \"his bold confession, if anything, appears to be just a manifestation of the impunity that crooks and cronies enjoy under President Putin and the Kremlin.\" Prigozhin did not say whether the election interference was aimed at propelling Republican candidates to power, but Russia was found to have interfered in the 2016 U.S. election in order to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign while boosting that of Trump, under whose presidency relations between the U.S. and Russia thawed. For its part, the Kremlin said Wednesday that the midterm elections would not improve the \"bad\" relations between Moscow and Washington and dismissed allegations that Russia was meddling in the vote. \"These elections cannot change anything essential. Relations still are, and will remain, bad,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\nBipartisan support firm, for now\n\nAnalysts tend to agree that what we could see potentially is a paring back of financial support but by no means a complete withdrawal of aid for now at least. \"We consider it as quite unlikely but not fully impossible that the new U.S. Congress may scale back U.S. military and financial support for Ukraine over time,\" Chief Economist at Berenberg Bank Holger Schmieding said in a note Wednesday. \"If so, that could impact the situation on the battlefield, prolong the war, impair Ukraine's ability to cope with the costs of war and trigger a further wave of refugees into the EU.\" For now, however, time and the U.S. political establishment appear to be on Ukraine's side. \"So far, a solid bi-partisan consensus has underpinned U.S. support for Ukraine,\" Schmieding noted, adding thatdespite some recent grumblings on the fringes of both U.S. political parties, Berenberg Bank expects this consensus to hold, \"at least for as long as no Trump-style 'America First' populist occupies the White House.\" \"The potential signal that a U.S. shift might send to China about the U.S. commitment to defend a beleaguered democracy (Ukraine - or Taiwan?) against aggression should be a strong argument to stay the course. Still, we need to watch the tail risk,\" he said. Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said it was in the U.S.' interest to continue supporting Ukraine, given it erodes the Putin regime. \"The war in Ukraine must provide the U.S. with the best chance for regime change in Russia, of taking Putin out. He is being weakened militarily, economically, diplomatically. And yes, the U.S. would absolutely love to see Putin removed from power - the calculation will be the next Russian leader cannot be as bad as Putin.\"\n\nEurope watches on\n\nAnalysts have noted that the military situation on the ground in Ukraine could well determine how much, and for how long, U.S. support for Ukraine continues, with Kyiv striving to show its allies that it can, and will, win the war, as long as Western military aid continues to flow to it. \"Judging by conversations with military experts, time is currently on the side of Ukraine's armed forces,\" Schmieding noted.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a press conference at the Rus Sanatorium, Oct. 31, 2022, in Sochi, Russia.

It adds that brigade commanders \"call people fodder\" and only care about their own careers.\n\nRussian officials tacitly acknowledged the source of the letter but said it exaggerated the losses.\n\n\"For more than 10 days, units of the 155th brigade of the Marines of the Pacific Fleet have been conducting effective offensive operations in the Uludar direction,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement. \"Due to the competent actions of the commanders of the units, the losses of the Marines over this period do not exceed 1% of the combat strength and 7% of the wounded, a significant part of which have already returned to duty.\"\n\nLatest developments:\n\nNearly 8,000 Ukrainian civilians, including 430 children, have been killed since the war began Feb. 24, according to the Ukrainian parliaments Commissioner for Human Rights, who also said almost 11,000 civilians have been injured.\n\nRussia is fortifying its lines throughout areas of occupation, likely aimed at stalling any rapid Ukrainian advances in the event the troops break through Russian lines, the British Defense Ministry said in its latest assessment.\n\nSatellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show a rapid expansion of a cemetery in southern Ukraine in the months after Russian forces seized the port city of Mariupol. It remains unclear how many people were buried there.\n\nTwo civilians were seriously wounded by exploding mines in Ukraines northeastern Kharkiv region, where Ukraine has retaken territory, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\n\nRussian-installed authorities in the partially occupied Kherson region said they have completed measures to evacuate residents ahead of anticipated Ukrainian advances.\n\nRussia paid $141 million and 3 captured weapons for Iran drones, report says\n\nRussia acquired more than 160 Iranian drones in August in exchange for the current equivalent of $141 million in cash and three captured missiles -- two of them from the U.S. -- that were meant for Ukraine, the British Sky News reported.\n\nIf accurate, the report would provide further evidence of Iran selling drones during the war to Russia, which both countries have denied. The unmanned aerial vehicles have been a major factor in Moscow's assault on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure and other civilian targets.\n\nThe unnamed security source cited in the story said Tehran and Moscow have recently agreed to another shipment of drones worth about $200 million. The source added that Iran may try to copy the technology from the captured weapons for future use.\n\nZelenskky tells climate forum Russia has ruined 5 million acres of Ukrainian forest\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told participants at the COP27 climate conference Tuesday that Russia's invasion has led to the destruction of 5 million acres of forest in his country while dramatically raising fossil fuel prices worldwide.\n\n\"That has forced dozens of countries to resume coal-fired power generation in order to lower energy prices for their people,\" he said in a video address.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia's \"insane and illegal war'' is keeping other countries from working collaboratively to confront climate change, adding that military aggression like the one Ukraine is confronting forces nations to focus on immediate protection at the risk of longer-term threats.\n\n\"There can be no effective climate policy without peace on Earth,\" he said.\n\nIndia urges peace but won't stop buying Russian oil\n\nWhile acknowledging the global impacts of the war in Ukraine, a conflict Russia is largely funding through oil sales, India's foreign minister said Tuesday that his country benefits from buying that oil at favorable prices and doesn't intend to stop.\n\nS. Jaishankar urged the Kremlin to find a diplomatic solution to the war but made it clear India will not follow the path of Western countries that have curtailed or cut off purchases of Russian energy to pressure Moscow into withdrawing its forces from Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking in Moscow, where he was meeting his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Jaishankar pointed out India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil and gas, adding: \"Our fundamental obligation is to ensure that Indian consumers have the best access to the most advantageous terms in the international markets. And in that respect, quite honestly, the India-Russia relationship has worked to our advantage. So if it works to my advantage, Id like to keep that going.\"\n\nZelenskyy makes rare pitch for peace talks, on tough terms\n\nUkraine's leader made a rare but contingency-laden pitch for peace talks with Russia on Tuesday, imploring the world to help \"force Russia into genuine peace negotiations.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again blamed Russia for the failure to establish talks, saying his nation's repeated proposals for peace have \"always received insane Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail.\"\n\nZelenskyy's demands for talks would likely draw a hard no from the Kremlin the return of all Russian-occupied land to Ukrainian control, respect for the U.N. Charter, compensation for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal and guarantees that Russia won't invade Ukraine again.\n\n\"These are completely understandable conditions,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia has repeatedly claimed to be willing to negotiate but has rejected Ukraine's conditions.\n\nUS ambassador to UN visits Kyiv, promises 'unwavering' support\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., met with Zelenskyy and a group of farmers and grain processors in Kyiv, promising to press for an extension of a crucial shipping deal with Russia set to expire next week. A Russian official said the Kremlin hasn't decided yet whether to renew the agreement.\n\n\"This site has taken on added importance because Russian forces have attacked so many of Ukraines other grain facilities,\" Thomas-Greenfield said in Kyiv, calling Ukraine \"the breadbasket of the world.\"\n\nShe also visited with families of war victims, urging the world to hold Russia accountable for \"atrocities.\"\n\n\"The Ukrainian people have inspired the world with their extraordinary courage as they fight for their freedom and territorial integrity,\" she said. \"In my meeting with the president, I made clear that the United States' commitment to Ukraine is unwavering.\"\n\nNorth Korea denies selling arms to Russia\n\nNorth Korea denied claims that its shipping artillery shells and ammunition to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby recently accused North Korea of covertly supplying a \"significant number\" of ammunition shipments to Russia. And the secretive nation's factories are producing uniforms for Russian soldiers, sources inside North Korea told Radio Free Asia.\n\nLast week, Russia sent North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a trainload of 30 thoroughbred horses, opening the border with its neighbor for the first time in 2 1/2 years.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press",

Duda said it was \"most-likely\" a Russian-made rocket but \"we do not have any conclusive evidence at the moment as to who launched this missile this is all still under investigation at the moment.\" He added it was likely Poland will active Natos article 4 at a meeting of Nato on Wednesday. This is from the Guardians diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. Poland's Duda says has no definitive evidence on who fired rocket. Poland has summoned RU ambassador over the firing of \"a Russian made missile\", but Ukraine has Russian made S-300s surface to air missiles (that would not be fired but for Russia destroying Ukr energy network).

Speaking to reporters, Morawiecki said security forces and international experts were in Przewodw, eastern Poland, where two people have been killed to try to determine the cause of the explosion. He repeated several already-announced measures, including an increased military readiness and talking to Nato allies about an article 4 meeting between member states. Warsaw will also step up monitoring of its airspace. The prime minister went on to ask for people to be restrained. \"I call on all Poles to remain calm around this tragedy. Lets be prudent, lets not let ourselves be manipulated. \"We need to be ready to face fake news, propaganda efforts.\"\n\nUpdated at 18.47 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 18.21 EST Julian Borger This is an analysis from our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, on why the explosion is unlikely to trigger a military escalation between Nato and Russia. He writes: Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an \"armed attack\" envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Deliberate armed attack is a real thing,\" Alberque said. \"Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles aint it.\" Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that rather than any form of direct Nato involvement would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets.

Foreign affairs spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said: \"On 15 November 2022, massive shelling of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure by the armed forces of the Russian Federation was observed for many hours. \"At 15:40 in the village of Przewodw a Russian-made missile fell, killing two citizens of the republic of Poland.\" The statement said that the Russian ambassador to Poland has also been summoned to give an explanation (see 11:10pm). A map showing where Przewodw is.\n\nUpdated at 18.41 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 18.10 EST The Polish foreign minister has summoned the Russian ambassador to Poland for an explanation of the events connected to the explosion in Przewodw. In a statement on Polands governments website, a spokesperson said: \"The minister of foreign affairs, Zbigniew Rau summoned the ambassador of the Russian federation to the ministry of foreign affairs and demanded immediate detailed explanations.\"\n\n15 Nov 2022 18.04 EST The US president, Joe Biden, has offered Polands leader, Andrzej Duda, the USs \"full support for and assistance with Polands investigation\", Reuters reports. In a telephone call, the Polish president gave Biden an update on the inquiry into the explosion that killed two people, and in turn Biden said the US had an \"ironclad\" commitment to Nato. The full readout provided by the White House said: \"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening. \"President Duda described Polands ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. \"President Biden offered full U.S support for and assistance with Polands investigation. President Biden reaffirmed the United States ironclad commitment to Nato. \"The two leaders said that they and their teams should remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.\" The US president has also spoken by phone to the Nato general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg. Duda has spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards: \"We exchanged available information and are clarifying all the facts all of Europe and the world must be fully protected from terrorist Russia.\"\n\nUpdated at 18.23 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.45 EST Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russian missile attacks on Tuesday caused shutdowns in two of the countrys nuclear power plants. In an address to the nation, he said: \"As a result of the strikes, several nuclear reactors at two plants were automatically disabled. These consequences were calculated, and the enemy knew exactly what it was doing.\" He said that power has been restored to 8m homes after blackouts caused by the latest bombardment. \"About 10 million Ukrainians were disconnected after the terrorist attack. Supply to eight million consumers has already been restored. Power engineers and repairmen will work all night,\" he tweeted.\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.40 EST UK foreign secretary James Cleverley has said the government is \"urgently\" looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland and is in contact with the government in Poland. \"We are urgently looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, and are in contact with our Polish friends and Nato allies,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.38 EST Summary Heres what we know so far, as investigators look into an explosion in Przewodw, a village near the border between Poland and Ukraine on Tuesday, which killed two people. Stray missiles are feared to have exploded in Poland , killing two agricultural workers in a village near its eastern border.\n\nIt came as Russia launched a 100-missile attack on Ukraine , causing damage to infrastructure that left 7m homes without supplies. It has also had an impact on power supply in neighbouring Moldova.\n\nIt is unclear whether the explosion was directly caused by a missile fired by Russia, or whether it is as a result of a Ukrainian anti-missile defence system shooting down a Russian missile.\n\nThe Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki , held an emergency meeting of a government committee on national security and defence matters.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Piotr Mller said that Warsaw had raised its level of military readiness in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nMller said the government was calling for a meeting to take place between Nato members. It would be possibly under article 4 of Natos treaty, which says they \"will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened\".\n\nRussia has denied any involvement. The defence ministry said in a statement: \"Russian firepower has launched no strikes at the area between Ukrainian-Polish border.\"\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he has \"no information\" about the situation in Poland.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it represents \"a very significant escalation\". His foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called for more air defence assistance, fighter jets and a Nato summit to stop further escalation. We will continue to provide updates throughout the evening.\n\nUpdated at 18.09 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.12 EST Nato ambassadors to have article 4 meeting on Wednesday - reports Nato ambassadors will meet on Wednesday at the request of Poland on the basis of the alliances article 4, two European diplomats have told Reuters. According to article 4 of the alliances founding treaty, members can raise any issue of concern, especially related to the security of a member country. Investigations continue into the circumstances around an explosion in Przewodw, near Polands border with Ukraine that killed two people. One of the diplomats said the alliance would act cautiously and needed time to verify how exactly the incident happened.\n\nUpdated at 17.19 EST",

                "cc_text": "In the last couple months, Ukraine has successfully pushed back against Russias invading forces. It retook a large chunk of territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv. It is on the verge of recapturing the only major cityKherson in the souththat Russia has occupied since February. Ukrainian forces have also targeted airfields in Crimea and may well be responsible for the attack that caused significant damage to the single bridge connecting the peninsula to the Russian mainland.\n\nAs the Crimea attacks indicate, Ukraine has not been shy about launching operations inside Russian-occupied territory. Artillery provided by the United Statesthe HIMARS multiple rocket launcherhas seriously weakened Russian forces located dozens of miles behind the front line. Ukraine has also relied on operatives in enemy territory to provide the information necessary to destroy Russian infrastructure, like a base run by the Russian paramilitary outfit Wagner Group in Luhansk province. Partisan outfits like the Free Ukraine Resistance Movement have taken out arms depots and killed collaborators.\n\nTheres a good reason why Russian recruits dont want to deploy to Ukraine and become cannon fodder.\n\nUkraine Adopts Offense\n\nMore controversially, Ukraine has expanded the war to the Russian mainland. In August and September, Ukrainian forces bombed military installations in the Belgorod region just over the border in Russia. The US government believes that the Ukrainians were behind the August 20 assassination attempt on prominent Putin advisor Alexander Dugin that killed his daughter.\n\nChorus for Peace in Ukraine Sings Louder\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRussia has retaliated even as it has fallen back. With the help of Iranian drones, it has launched aerial attacks throughout Ukraine, knocking out about one-third of the countrys energy infrastructure. Russia, a petrostate dependent on its fossil fuel sales, has also managed to destroy 90 percent of Ukraines wind power and half its solar energy generation, a grim reminder that this is a battle not just between two states but between two different visions of the future.\n\nThe latest risk, with Russian forces preparing to retreat from Kherson, is the destruction, partial or total, of the Kakhovka hydroelectric facility. Blowing up the dam, which is located about 45 miles north and east of Kherson, would deprive Ukraine of electricity. The release of all that stored water would complicate Ukraines efforts to recapture that territory. On the other hand, it would also disrupt water supply to Crimea via the North Crimean canal, which is certainly not in Russias interest. And it would compromise the functioning of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is certainly not in anyones interest.\n\nThe ultimate risk is that Russia will use a nuclear weapon. Although such an escalation would bring little battlefield advantageand likely drive a wedge between the Kremlin and wavering allies like ChinaVladimir Putin has shown a willingness in the past to cross red lines.\n\nUkrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky was originally determined to repel Russian invaders and reestablish the pre-February territorial status quo. That objective has shifted after Ukraines successful counteroffensive, and now Zelensky wants to press further and eject Russian forces from all of the Donbas region and Crimea as well. This more ambitious goal troubles those who worry about more aggressive Russian responses.\n\nSo, will Ukraines battlefield successes make Russian escalation more likely and an eventual peace agreement less so? In other words, should Ukraine \"cut its wins\" and negotiate with Russia now from a position of relative strength? And should the United States put pressure on Ukraine to make such a deal?\n\nGetting to Compromise\n\nBack in May, Henry Kissinger made the case that Ukraine should give up territory for peace (a position I argued against here). John Marks, the founder of the venerable Search for Common Ground, made a similar case, but from a somewhat different starting point:\n\nDespite the determination of Ukrainians and the assistance provided by NATO countries, continued fighting is likely to result in Ukraine ceasing to be a viable country. The only way out would seem to be a negotiated agreement in which Ukraine would retain its national independence and Russia would also achieve some of its aims. Otherwise, neither side would be likely to agree.\n\nContinued fighting over the last six months, of course, has resulted in the opposite: Ukraine has preserved its viability as a country by fighting with redoubled determination. In theory, Ukraine could have traded territory for peace back in the spring. But theory plus a quarter will get you a gumdrop.\n\nIn reality, Russia wasnt interested in negotiating because the Kremlin still harbored greater territorial ambitions. Meanwhile, on the other side of the imaginary negotiating table, there is no evidence that the United States or the UK pressured Ukraine to continue fighting rather than accept a supposed olive branch, despite claims to the contrary. Indeed, the Zelensky government deeply distrusted the Kremlin. Russian war crimes and consolidation of rule in occupied territories fueled this mistrust, not anything Boris Johnson or the Biden administration might have said to him.\n\nAnd yet, this notion that Ukraine must compromiseand the United States must effectively twist its arm to do soremains a persistent theme among certain segments of the peace movement. Consider this recent poll from the Quincy Institute, which shows that Americans by a rather slim margin (49 percent to 37 percent) believe that the US government should do more diplomatically to end the war in Ukraine. A somewhat larger percentage of all voters (57 percent) strongly or somewhat strongly support the United States pursuing diplomatic negotiations even if Ukraine has to make compromises.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, Quincy concludes that \"Americans want to see an end to this brutal and bloody war, and dread the potential costs and impacts a drawn-out conflict may have on Ukrainians, Americans, and the world.\" Well, who doesnt want to see an end to the war? And who doesnt dread potential costs and impacts?\n\nAs for Washington doing more diplomatically, how feasible is such a suggestion? After all, the United States is an active party to the conflict and therefore not an honest broker. Of course, Washington should keep open channels of communication with the Kremlin. But other than warning the Russians not to escalate and outlining various deterrent measures, what can the Biden administration do without going behind the backs of the Ukrainians?\n\nThe challenge of urging diplomacy at this moment can be readily seen in this weeks kerfuffle involving the Progressive Caucus. After releasing a letter urging the Biden administration to do more diplomatically to end the war, it had to turn around and retract the document after some signatories objected to its timing. Theyd signed the letter back in June or July, and facts had meanwhile changed on the ground. Moreover, the letter risked becoming just another voice urging the Ukrainians to \"compromise\" in a chorus of disreputables that includes Elon Musk, Tulsi Gabbard, and Trumpists in the Republican Party.\n\nTo Save Ukraine, America Must Help Europe\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe diplomatic overture suggested by both the retracted letter and the Quincy pollnot stated but strongly impliedwould be that the United States persuade Ukraine to give up its recently expanded goal of retaking the Donbas and Crimea. In other words, behind this talk of compromise lurks the same quid pro quo raised by Kissinger: land for peace. In another context, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, progressives have urged a similar formulabut exactly in reverse. It is the aggressor country, Israel, that is expected to give up land to the Palestinians in order to secure amicable relations.\n\nWho among those urging more diplomacy and greater commitment to compromise is asking Russia to give up territory in order to achieve peace?\n\nAvoiding Nuclear War\n\nThe use of nuclear weapons is a trump card. Putin supposedly is considering playing this card if backed into a corner. But it is also a card played by those urging Ukraine to compromise: its not worth blowing up the world just so that Ukraine can recover a few scraps of land.\n\nThis is a version of the \"worst consequences\" argument. Ukrainian battlefield successes will only bring greater suffering to the Ukrainian people because of Russian aerial retaliation. Such successes also put Europeans at greater risk because of Russian energy retaliation. And then theres the suffering of the Global South because of Russian agricultural retaliation. This suffering is very real. But this formulation is also the geopolitical version of a shakedown: if you dont kiss his ring and heed his threats, the mafioso don promises to rub out not only you but your entire extended family.\n\nThe Ukrainians have demonstrated that theyre willing to accept these consequences. According to a Gallup poll in mid-September, a solid majority of 70 percent of Ukrainians prefer to fight until they win against Russia. Only 26 percent favor negotiations to end the war immediately. Europeans, meanwhile, have more mixed views with generally strong backing for military assistance to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, but undercurrents of support in Germany and France for a more immediate diplomatic solution.\n\nRussian Military Rout in Ukraine has Major Implications for the MENA Region\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSignificantly, French President Emmanuel Macron, who had previously been the greatest advocate of a deal that doesnt humiliate Russia, recently declared that Ukraine must \"choose the moment and the terms\" of any peace deal. The successful Ukrainian counterattack has stiffened the backbone of its wavering defenders.\n\nNo one, of course, wants to deal with the consequences of nuclear war. Its hard to rule out the possibility that Putin authorizes the use of tactical nuclear weapons, given the tensions in US-Russian relations and the tendency of the Russian president to \"damn the torpedoes.\" But its also hard to imagine that Russia would actively plan a nuclear option, even a limited one. The Kremlin has taken great pains to avoid a direct confrontation with NATO. For instance, although it has threatened to bomb the convoys of weapons coming from the West, Russia has not attacked any of the supply hubs.\n\nThe fact that Putin even considers the use of nuclear weapons is a great failure of US policy as well. Successive administrations have normalized nuclear weapons by developing various tactical variants. Although arms control agreements have limited and even reduced numbers of strategicor long-rangenuclear weapons, so-called battlefield nukes have never been subject to any limitations (other than self-imposed ones). The United States deploys 100 nuclear gravity bombs (out of 200 in the US arsenal) in five European countries. Fortunately, the Biden administration has nixed a Trump proposal to revive nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles, but these weapons could make a comeback in a future Republican administration.\n\nThe United States must plan for a post-war security order that takes real steps toward nuclear disarmament, with tactical nukes included in the negotiating process. It isnt good enough any longer for a U.S. president to pledge, as Obama did, to get to zero nukes at some vague point in the future.\n\nGoing Too Far\n\nSome administration officials are clearly uncomfortable with Ukrainian efforts to bring the war directly to Russian soil. Thats why they leaked their intel on Ukrainian involvement in the attempted assassination of Dugin. True, the United States is providing Ukraine with considerable information and technology to help with targeting Russian assets, for instance to kill Russian generals and to take out radars. But both the United States and Europe are trying to tread a fine line: inflict losses on Russia without triggering a direct confrontation. So, for instance, the West has refused to impose a no-fly zone above Ukraine. It has also not acceded to Ukrainian requests for longer-range artillery (ATACMS) and fighter jets, precisely the weapons Ukraine would need to attack deeper into Russian-occupied territory or into Russia itself.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no such restraining hand on the Russian side. Putin can order as many punishing air strikes of Ukrainian cities and infrastructure as his arsenal allows. He can engage in as many war crimes as he deems necessary, since he doesnt seem particularly bothered by international condemnation. There is no significant anti-war counterforce within Russia with which Putin has to negotiate. In fact, its quite the opposite. He faces hardline nationalists and more aggressive military bloggers who want him to prosecute the war more vigorously.\n\nSo, lets be honest. The side that needs to compromise is Russia. So far, it shows no sign of such willingness. The annexation of the Donbas regions suggests a maximalist position. That annexation will not likely be reversed at the negotiation tableimagine Putin trying to sell such a loss to a population that thinks this war is a threat to its very existenceso Ukraine feels compelled to reclaim that territory by force.\n\nIdeally the rule of law should prevail over the rule of force. But Russia blew a gaping hole through that principle by invading Ukraine in the first place. The few forays into Russian territory that Ukraine has madethe one assassination, the couple of attacksdo little to alter the fundamental asymmetry of this war whereby Russian soldiers kill Ukrainian civilians with impunity and Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives.\n\nIn other words, Ukraine has a long way to go before it has gone too far.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observers editorial policy.",

Mayor Vitali Klitschko told state media: We are doing everything to avoid this. But lets be frank, our enemies are doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die. And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations. Ukraines state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo said parts of Kyiv were scheduled to have hourly rotating blackouts Sunday, with blackouts also planned in the nearby Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions. The Associated Press reports that Kyiv plans to deploy about a 1,000 heating points, but this may not be enough for a city of 3 million people.\n\n6 Nov 2022 13.02 EST Ukraines army has accused Russia of the large-scale destruction of civilian vessels moored on the banks of the Dnieper River, in the occupied southern region of Kherson that Kyivs forces are trying to capture. Ukrainian forces have been piling pressure on Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnieper, fuelling speculation that Moscows troops are preparing to retreat to the other side. A spokesperson for Ukraines general staff said in a statement that the fuel from the destroyed vessels had leaked into the rivers delta and also accused Moscows forces of appropriating the vessels engines and other equipment, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian general staff gave no explanation for Moscows actions. Destroying civilian vessels would prevent Ukrainian forces from using them should they decide to cross to the eastern side in the event of any Russian withdrawal.\n\nUpdated at 13.09 EST\n\n6 Nov 2022 12.50 EST Fighters affiliated with the Russian-installed administration of Ukraines eastern Donetsk region have arrived in the town of Amvrosiivka after being freed in a prisoner swap with the Ukrainian military. \"I still cant believe Im home,\" a returning prisoner of war, Maxim Chekanov, told Reuters. \"It was so horrible. I wouldnt wish it on anyone.\" added Chekanov, who said he had been captured by Ukrainian forces on 11 October.

Russian soldiers warned civilians that Ukraines army was preparing for a massive attack and told people to leave for the citys right bank immediately. Ukrainian forces have been pushing forward in the south, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Kyiv. AP reports: Russian forces are preparing for a Ukrainian counteroffensive to seize back the southern city of Kherson, which was captured during the early days of the invasion. In September, Russia illegally annexed Kherson as well as three other regions of Ukraine and subsequently declared martial law in the four provinces. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has moved tens of thousands of civilians out of the city.\n\nNataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraines Southern Forces, told state television that Russia has been \"occupying and evacuating\" Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians that theyre leaving when in fact theyre digging in. She said: There are defence units that have dug in there quite powerfully, a certain amount of equipment has been left, firing positions have been set up.\n\nRussian forces are also digging in in the east of Ukraine. Russian attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar. Shelling killed one civilian and wounded three. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regions Ukrainian governor, said on Saturday: The destruction is daily, if not hourly. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and \"protecting\" the region was one of Putins justifications for the invasion. Russian troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. While Russias \"greatest brutality\" was focused in the Donetsk region, \"constant fighting\" continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Between Saturday and Sunday, Russias launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes hitting more than 35 villages in nine regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, killing two people and wounding six, the presidents office said. AP reports: In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. The front line is now on Bakhmuts outskirts, where mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian military company, are reported to be leading the charge. Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the group who has typically remained under the radar, is taking a more visible role in the war. In a statement Sunday he announced the funding and creation of \"militia training centers\" in Russias Belgorod and Kursk regions in the southwest, saying that locals were best placed to \"fight against sabotage\" on Russian soil. The training centers are in addition to a military technology center the group said it was opening in St. Petersburg.\n\nUpdated at 10.05 EST\n\n6 Nov 2022 09.32 EST Mayor of Kyiv tells residents to prepare for the worst The mayor of Kyiv has warned residents that if Russia keeps striking the countrys energy infrastructure they must prepare for having no electricity, water or heat as temperatures drop below freezing. Mayor Vitali Klitschko told state media: We are doing everything to avoid this. But lets be frank, our enemies are doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die. And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations. Ukraines state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo said parts of Kyiv were scheduled to have hourly rotating blackouts Sunday, with blackouts also planned in the nearby Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions. The Associated Press reports that Kyiv plans to deploy about a 1,000 heating points, but this may not be enough for a city of 3 million people.\n\n6 Nov 2022 09.11 EST The Russian-installed administration in Ukraines Kherson region said electricity and water supplies were \"temporarily absent\" on Sunday after what it said was a \"terrorist attack\" damaged three power lines in the region. In a statement on Telegram, it said the attack had been organised by Ukraine, though it provided no evidence, Reuters reported. The news agency said it was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from either side. Russian state-owned news agency Tass said that ten settlements, including Kherson city, which had a pre-war population of 280,000, had been left without electricity. Russian officials have in recent weeks repeatedly warned civilians to leave Kherson, amid what they say are preparations for a Ukrainian offensive against the city, the only regional capital that Russia has captured since ordering tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February.\n\nUpdated at 10.05 EST\n\n6 Nov 2022 07.07 EST Ukrainian authorities: Russian forces intensify strikes in eastern Ukraine Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the defending army, Ukrainian authorities have said. Following Moscows illegal annexation and declaration of martial law in Donetsk province Russia, the attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regions Ukrainian governor said. Late on Saturday he said shelling had killed one civilian and wounded three. In a state television interview Kyrylenko said: The destruction is daily, if not hourly. The Associated Press gives more background: Moscow-backed separatists controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Protecting the separatists self-proclaimed republic there was one of Russian President Vladimir Putins justifications for the invasion, and his troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. In his nightly video address on Saturday Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that while Russias \"greatest brutality\" was focused in the Donetsk region, \"constant fighting\" continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles). AP reports: Between Saturday and Sunday, Russias launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes impacting more than 35 villages in seven regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, according to the presidents office. Russia has focused on striking energy infrastructure over the last month, causing power shortages and rolling outages across the country. The capital, Kyiv, was scheduled to have hourly blackouts rotating Sunday in various parts of the city of some 3 million and the surrounding region,\n\nRolling blackouts also were planned in the Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions, Ukraines state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said in a Telegram post. More positive news was the re-connection of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraines power grid, local media reported Sunday. Europes largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling system, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, some 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. In Kharkiv, officials are working to identify bodies found in mass graves after the Russians withdrew, Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesperson for the regional prosecutors office, said in an interview with local media.\n\nDNA samples have been collected from 450 bodies discovered in a mass grave in the city of Izium, but the samples need to be matched with relatives and so far only 80 people have participated, he said.\n\nUpdated at 10.06 EST",

Pool photo by Sergej Bobylev\n\nMany of the Russian cheerleaders of the invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday cast the defense ministers order to withdraw from Kherson City as a monumental defeat Moscows most devastating, according to one of them, since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe announced retreat crystallized the failures of President Vladimir V. Putins war effort. It would be a humiliating loss of the largest Ukrainian city that Russia had seized in its nine-month invasion, coming just weeks after Mr. Putin declared it to be an irrevocable part of Russia in a bombastic celebration on Red Square.\n\nBut analysts who follow Mr. Putin closely saw the order as a reminder of Mr. Putins willingness to make tactical concessions in what he sees as a large-scale conflict with the West that, according to people who know him, he believes he can still win.\n\n\"This just confirms, in my view, how pragmatic Putin is,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, an analyst who studies Mr. Putin for her political analysis firm R.Politik, said in a phone interview. \"Hes not as crazy as we thought.\"\n\nMr. Putin himself was silent on the matter, allowing his officials to do the talking. Instead, Mr. Putin toured a neurological hospital and spoke at an event commemorating the 75th anniversary of Russias national public health institute, praising it for fighting the coronavirus and helping care for \"our heroes\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe announced retreat came a week after Mr. Putin agreed to rejoin the agreement allowing the shipment of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, reversing course after Russia threatened to block it in retaliation for a drone attack on the headquarters of Russias Black Sea Fleet in Crimea that it attributed to Ukraine, but which Kyiv denied.\n\nAnd it comes as people close to the Kremlin are increasingly speculating about the possibility of a cease-fire agreement with Ukraine and highlighting reports in the Western news media that Washington was encouraging Kyiv to be open to talks.\n\n\"Theres a certain logic here,\" Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research organization close to the Russian government, said of the order to retreat from the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nBy shifting to the rivers more defensible east bank, Mr. Kortunov said, the Russian military was seeking to enable what he described as the Kremlins top near-term priority: a \"stabilization, a fixation\" of the front line.\n\nBut Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst and the director of Rochan Consulting, based in Gdansk, Poland, said the motives for the announcement were puzzling. \"From a military point of view, such an announcement doesnt make sense, unless there is a second bottom to the story,\" he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\n\nIn a retreat, a military would typically seek to maintain the appearance of a strong defense while withdrawing in secret. Yet the Russian military had also publicly announced retreats from north of the capital, Kyiv, in the spring and the northeastern Kharkiv region in late summer, after being defeated by Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"You have to give it to them,\" Mr. Muzyka said. \"They are consistent.\"\n\nMilitant rhetoric was emanating from Moscow just weeks ago, when the Kremlins annexation of four Ukrainian regions it only partly controls including the Kherson region appeared to signal a major escalation of the war and possibly a prelude to the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut since then, Mr. Putin has dialed back his nuclear rhetoric, and on Wednesday some of Russias most influential pro-war voices voiced support for the Kherson withdrawal.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov, the strongman ruler of the Russian republic of Chechnya, described it as a \"difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of high-profile statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers.\"\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the business magnate who runs the private army known as the Wagner Group, said it was now important \"not to agonize, not to writhe in paranoia, but to draw conclusions and work on mistakes.\"\n\nThose statements were a sign that the Kremlin had carefully laid the propaganda groundwork for the withdrawal, seeking to avoid the sort of internecine sniping that followed Russias chaotic retreats earlier this fall in eastern and northern Ukraine.\n\nStill, it did not silence the hawks outrage entirely. One pro-Kremlin analyst, Sergei Markov, described the retreat as \"Russias biggest geopolitical defeat since the moment of the collapse of the U.S.S.R.\"\n\nAndrew E.

U.S. officials have since confirmed that theyve been in touch with their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts to deescalate tensions and avoid miscalculations, though theres no imminent campaign to get the warring parties talking.\n\nZelenskyy announced his new stance just before congressional elections in the U.S. in which Republicans are expected to recapture at least one chamber potentially endangering further financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\nRepresentatives for Ukraines government didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. The National Security Council declined to comment for this story, but pointed to Sullivans remarks while in Kyiv last week. \"The conversation that we need to have with the international community in support of Ukraine is, what are the terms of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine? Thats what we are intent on driving towards, thats what we would support, and thats what we believe our collective efforts can help achieve,\" Sullivan said during his visit.\n\nWilliam Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, argued that Ukraines five conditions are reasonable since they adhere to international law and make Russia pay for its transgressions. He also said Zelenskyy seems sincere in his offer for peace talks as long as Putin is serious.\n\n\"Weve seen President Putin bend to reality,\" Taylor said, noting that Russia left and rejoined a grain-shipping deal and tamped down nuclear threats. However, real negotiations probably wouldnt happen until Moscow \"takes some more military defeats.\"\n\nKurt Volker, special representative for Ukraine in the Trump administration, argues the U.S. shouldnt publicly push Kyiv toward the negotiating table at least not now.\n\n\"Clearly Putin has no intention of negotiating seriously or accepting these conditions. Putin is determined to continue fighting and targeting Ukrainian cities. Ukraine needs to be decisively winning on the ground, retaking its territory and the U.S. should be trying to help the Ukrainians do that as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported that the Biden administration wanted Kyiv to drop the Putin-out-of-power condition.",

A whole lot would change,\" Biden said ahead of his trip.\n\nBiden hopes his stops at a climate meeting here on the Red Sea, a gathering of Southeast Asian nations in Cambodia and a high-stakes Group of 20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali will assert American leadership in areas former President Donald Trump either ignored or actively shunned.\n\nFour defining global threats will loom over Bidens trip: Russias war in Ukraine, escalating tensions with China, the existential problem of climate change and the potential for a global recession in the coming months. Other flashpoints, like North Koreas rapidly accelerating provocations and uncertainty over Irans nuclear program, will also factor in.\n\nOf those, defending Ukraine and combating climate change could be the most impacted by results from this weeks election.\n\nAt moments of domestic political turmoil, US presidents have often turned to foreign policy, where they can act with relatively few congressional restraints. President Barack Obama launched a similar tour of Asia after his self-described \"shellacking\" in the 2010 midterms.\n\nBiden and his advisers believe they are entering the series of high-stakes meetings with a solid argument that his version of the US role in the world will endure. He resisted historical and political headwinds in this years midterm elections while many of Trumps handpicked candidates lost. And over the past year, he secured passage of a major climate investment and rallied the world behind efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia.\n\nYet the anxieties of American allies persist over the future of US commitments to Ukraine, to fighting climate change, to treaty partners and, perhaps most urgently, to upholding Democratic norms. Foreign diplomats have watched intently as the midterm political season played out, searching for clues to how the American electorate was judging Biden's first two years in office and reporting back to their capitals on voter dissatisfaction that could fuel Trump's return to office.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Republicans appeared to be moving toward gaining control of the House of Representatives.

The United States does not believe that the additional weapons will alter the trajectory of the war.\n\n\"Our indications are the DPRK is covertly supplying and were going to monitor to see whether shipments are received,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"Our information indicates that theyre trying to obscure the method of supply by funneling them through other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\"\n\nNorth Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so.\n\nThe Biden administration said in September that Russia was seeking to purchase artillery shells and rockets from North Korea.

By helping Ukraine defeat Russian President Vladimir Putins forces, we not only staunch the dangerous spread of Putinism beyond Russias borders, but we send a signal to Putin, as well as Chinas Xi and other authoritarian leaders, that we will stand by democratic allies in their struggle for freedom. Thanks to the heroism of its fighters and citizens, Ukraine has imposed enormous costs on Russian forces and is regaining previously occupied territory. President Biden has said the United States will continue its support \"for as long as it takes.\" That is the right stance. Much to the surprise of many officials and analysts, it looks increasingly possible that Ukraine could win this war. It is in U.S. national interests to help them do so.\n\nThe United States has provided more than $20 billion in vital military assistance to Ukraine since Russias first invasion in 2014, with most of it coming after Putin launched the latest phase of the war in February. U.S. support has made a massive difference on the battlefield, enabling Ukraine to regain the initiative, inflict heavy losses of personnel and equipment and push back invading and occupying Russian forces.\n\nIts not enough to help Ukraine merely defend the territory it currently controls; we must help Ukraine win this war and defeat Russian forces. If negotiations prove to be the path Ukraine seeks to pursue, we should help them start from the strongest position possible so that any talks are carried out on Kyivs terms, not Moscows. Any negotiated outcome must ensure a lasting peace, not simply a respite for Russian forces to reconstitute themselves and invade another day.\n\nPodcast November 27 2023 Will Saletan: Trumps Pee-wee Herman Moment Trump wants you to know that he remembers who the president is. Plus, the asymmetry\n\nSupport for Ukraine has been bipartisan and popular among the American people. Congress has voted several times this year, by wide margins, for significant assistance packages. Only a small minority of Republicans in both the Senate and House have voted against providing aid.\n\nBut recent comments and statements by members of Congress have raised questions about the sustainability of that congressional support. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy predicted that a new Republican-controlled House after the midterms would no longer provide a \"blank check\" to Ukraine. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went even further, telling a rally in Iowa that \"under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine.\" McCarthy hasnt retracted his remarks nor contradicted Greene, though Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, pushed back, arguing that the majority of the Republican caucus supports assistance to Ukraine.\n\nDays after McCarthys comments, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged the White House and other allies to \"be quicker and more proactive to get Ukraine the aid they need.\" And Sen. James E. Risch, who would chair the Foreign Relations Committee if the Republicans retake the Senate, told the Washington Post, \"Ukrainians alone must decide the future of Ukraine. I support their fight for freedom, which they are winning on the battlefield. Any efforts to appease Putin are dangerous, irresponsible and will only encourage Russias aggression.\"\n\nFrom the other side of the aisle, the House Progressive Caucus released an open letter to President Biden signed by 30 Democratic House members urging him to pursue a \"proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a ceasefire\" in the war.\n\nFollowing an immediate avalanche of criticism, including from some Democrats listed as signers, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Progressive Caucus, took the unusual step of retracting the letter, blaming staff for releasing it \"without vetting.\"\n\nDuring a recent visit to Croatia, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to reassure nervous Ukrainians and other Europeans in stressing that \"support for Ukraine is bipartisan, bicameral, that means in the House and in the Senate, and it starts in the White House with our president.\"\n\nStill, damage has been done. Much like McCarthys remarks, the letter from House Democrats was ill-conceived, ill-timed, and deeply demoralizing to Ukraine. Ukrainians are the ones fighting and dying in defense of their country and freedom. They rely on our assistance to beat back Russian forces. The last thing they need is to worry whether Americas support will wane.\n\nNot helping are calls from the think tank community pushing for negotiations just when the Ukrainians are on the march. In Foreign Affairs, the Rand Corporations Samuel Charap and Miranda Priebe seemed to bemoan the withdrawal of the progressives ill-timed and ill-advised letter after a \"predictable outcry.\" Doubling down on the thrust of that letter, they expressed support for \"openness to an eventual negotiated end to the war\" and dismissed the \"optimistic scenario\" that Ukraine could actually defeat Russia in this war. Such calls undermine Ukrainians confidence in American support.\n\nOf course, the call to pursue negotiations is not new, and Charap and others have been suggesting it since the beginning of the conflict. They claimed that the only possible outcome was a negotiated peace and that the best the United States could do was push for negotiations as soon as possible. They even argued that U.S. military assistance was futile since it couldnt change the \"lopsided\" military balance favoring Russia and would only prolong the agony before the inevitable negotiated settlement ratifying Russias superior military position.\n\nThe Stimson Centers Emma Ashford argues that the question is \"not whether negotiations are needed to end the war, but when and how they should unfold.\" In a suggestion unlikely to go over well in Ukraine, Ashford contemplates \"some face-saving deal in which de facto realities, such as Russian legal control of Crimea, could be recognized, and which the Kremlin could portray to the Russian public as genuine concessions by the West.\" Incredibly, she even considers other territorial concessions Ukraine could offer Putin, including Crimea and \"some of the Donbas.\" Meanwhile, Ashford urges Ukraine to \"tone down triumphalist talk\" and proposes that the Biden administration \"embrace flexibility, particularly in working out which sanctions against Russia can be lifted without strengthening Putins regime,\" without specifying which ones.\n\nCharles Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations also enters the fray in the New York Times, arguing, \"Sooner rather than later, the West needs to move Ukraine and Russia from the battlefield to the negotiating table, brokering a diplomatic effort to shut the war down and arrive at a territorial settlement.\" As part of a \"hypothetical deal,\" Kupchan proposes taking NATO membership for Ukraine off the table and having Ukraine make territorial concessions, which the Ukrainian population strongly opposes.\n\nCalls for negotiations now or \"preparing\" for negotiations now are sneaky ways of seeking the same thing. The point isnt to be pro- or anti-negotiation. The point is to set the conditions for negotiations, should they come about, that lead to a real settlement that reflects U.S. interests in maintaining a sovereign, independent, sustainable Ukraine and a Russia that foregoes waging war against its neighbors on behalf of imperial ambitions to recreate, more or less, the Soviet empire.\n\nThere may not be a negotiation as long as Putin remains in power. That means we have to play for the long haul. Pushing for negotiations without regard to the balance of forces on the ground could well undermine the morale of the Ukrainians fighting in the field today. The central question of the war now is whether Russian forces combat effectiveness and morale crack before Ukraine faces economic and social exhaustion. Undermining our own side now is the height of folly.\n\nThe United States should not pressure Ukraine into negotiations with Putin when the Russian leader has never demonstrated any serious interest in ending the war. Given his responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against Ukraine, there is little support inside Ukraine for sitting down with Moscow and trading territory for a ceasefire. Any hope for serious negotiations actually rests on setting the conditions that would enable both sides to come to the table. Putin started this war, but Ukraine is on the march. If Putin wants to negotiate, its up to him to askand not in a way that seeks to buy time for the Russian side.\n\nNot every war has a diplomatic solution. Sometimes, the solution comes from military victory, and Ukrainians are confident, despite the tremendous losses they are suffering, that they will prevail. Victory for Ukraine means the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and the Ukrainians have made significant progress in this direction. Concerns that an \"uncontrolled\" escalatory spiral will end in World War III are vastly exaggerated. The recent climbdowns by Russia with regard to the Black Sea grain deal and the Putin/Foreign Ministry statements denying any intention to use nuclear weapons are the latest evidence indicating that the Wests ability to support Ukraine is greater than many have generally understood.\n\nMore than 80,000 Russians fighters have been killed or wounded in the fighting, an absolutely staggering toll. Running short of men, Putin resorted in September to ordering the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of new recruits, a very unpopular move that he had hoped to avoid. In response to that order, hundreds of thousands of Russians have fled the country. Those unable to escape have found themselves without uniforms, weapons, food, or shelter in increasingly inhospitable conditions on the battlefield.\n\nWhile Ukraine continues to pay a steep price in lives lost and infrastructure damaged, it has turned the tide. Putins largely indirect hints that Russia might resort to using weapons of mass destruction, including his defense ministers latest absurd claims that Ukraine intends to deploy a \"dirty bomb,\" are designed to discourage us from continuing our critical support to Ukraine. We should not fall for such tricks.\n\nPutin is expected to attend the G-20 meeting in Indonesia in mid-November. Inviting him to attendor even participate remotelyas he bears responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide against Ukraine makes a travesty of the G-20. While never a gathering of democracies (given the participation of China and Saudi Arabia, along with Russia), the leaders of such major economic powers should be isolating Putin and applying pressure on him in every way possible, not including him in glitzy summits.\n\nDo any leaders want their photo taken with their Russian counterpart? Biden should resist any temptation to meet with Putin, whether to discuss the possible release of Americans unfairly held prisoner in Russia or to avoid \"jeopardizing cooperation between Washington and Moscow on issues of global importance, such as arms control,\" as Charap naively argues.\n\nNow is the time to redouble American and European support for Ukraine and provide the weapons and assistance that country needs, including financial assistance to stave off an economic collapse. Our European allies have fallen woefully short in providing desperately needed financial and economic assistance to Ukraine, which is hemorrhaging between $5 and $7 billion a month. Europe this year has sent far more money to Russia for energy imports than it has provided Ukraine in assistance.\n\nNow is not the time to show weakness or fear, nor to demoralize the brave Ukrainians who are fighting for their freedomand, for that matter, ours. There may well come a time for negotiations, but no reasonable observer thinks we are anywhere near that point yet.\n\nFor the moment, Ukraines battle is our battle, and the stakes could hardly be greater.",

                "cc_text": "Preamble\n\nWe, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, underline our strong sense of unity and our unshakable commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to protect the rights of all, including the most vulnerable.\n\nAll Members of the United Nations must refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any state in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Violations of universally agreed and legally binding fundamental principles such as peaceful cooperation, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial integrity are unacceptable. We are clear in our commitment to hold those responsible for egregious violations of such basic principles of international law to account.\n\n1. Russias war against Ukraine\n\nWe again call on Russia to immediately stop its war of aggression against Ukraine and withdraw all of its forces and military equipment. Together with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba we condemn Russias recent escalation, including its attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, across Ukraine using missiles and Iranian drones and trainers. Through these attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. Indiscriminate attacks against civilian population and infrastructure constitute war crimes and we reiterate our determination to ensure full accountability for these and crimes against humanity. We also condemn the violation of Moldovan airspace.\n\nRussias irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable. Any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We also reject Russias false claims that Ukraine is preparing a radiological \"dirty bomb\". The inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that these allegations are baseless, and we commend Ukraine for its transparency.\n\nWe also condemn Russias continued seizure and militarization of Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and the willful destabilization of its operations. We support the IAEAs efforts to establish a Safety and Security Zone.\n\nWe will continue to impose economic costs on Russia and on other countries, individuals or entities providing military support for Moscows war of aggression, as several of us have already done regarding Irans provision of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Russia.\n\nWe reiterate our call for the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling Russias war of aggression, including permitting Russias armed forces to use Belarusian territory to launch missiles targeting Ukraine. If the Belarusian authorities more directly involve Belarus in Russias war, the G7 will impose overwhelming additional costs on the regime.\n\nWe reiterate our unwavering commitment to continue providing the financial, humanitarian, defense, political, technical, and legal support Ukraine needs to alleviate the suffering of its people and to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. We salute the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russias unprovoked aggression, and we are committed to helping Ukraine meet its winter preparedness needs.\n\nToday we establish a G7 coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. We look forward to the 13 December international conference in Paris aimed at supporting Ukraines civilian resilience, organized by France and Ukraine. We also welcome the outcomes of the 25 October International Experts Conference in Berlin and remain committed to contribute to the recovery, reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine. We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nWe reaffirm our support for press freedom and access to reliable information globally. We will continue to counter Russias disinformation, including false allegations concerning bioweapons. We are strengthening the G7 Rapid Response Mechanisms capacity for a coordinated response.\n\nRecalling the 11 October G7 Leaders statement, we welcome President Zelenskyys readiness for a just peace based on respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty, and its legitimate right to defend itself from aggression. Russias calls for negotiations are not credible when it continues to escalate the war and issue new threats and disinformation.\n\n2. Global consequences of Russias war against Ukraine\n\nRussias war of aggression is a driver of the most severe global food and energy crises in recent history. We condemn Russias attempts to leverage energy and food exports as a tool of geopolitical coercion. The resulting turmoil is hitting vulnerable countries and communities around the world particularly hard, exacerbating an already dire situation caused by the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and existing conflicts. We will continue to coordinate among the G7 and beyond to help mitigate the consequences of Russias war of aggression on global economic stability and international food, nutrition and energy security by both addressing acute needs and making medium to long term investments in resilient systems.\n\nWe strongly support the United Nations Secretary-Generals call for the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), which has reduced global food prices. We urge Russia to heed the Secretary-Generals call. The G7 is also leading other vital international initiatives, including the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) and the EU-led Solidarity Lanes. We are also accelerating our work to get fertilizers to the most vulnerable. We commit to promote more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems globally and call on the G20 to support these efforts.\n\nWe continue to encourage oil-producing countries to increase production, which will decrease volatility in energy markets. We will finalize implementation of the price cap on seaborne Russian oil in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Global issues\n\nWe reaffirm the need to strengthen and modernize the United Nations, with a view to making it more effective in the face of mounting global challenges, and we express our support for the vision of the UN Secretary-Generals Our Common Agenda.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts for a more secure, more stable and safer world. We are strengthening export controls, including through international export control regimes, on materials, technology and research that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. In this context, we support Indias early entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n\nWe will also continue to enhance our coordination and cooperation, within and beyond the G7, including on economic security challenges, and we will stand up to acts of economic coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm our intention to increase debt transparency and find solutions to debt vulnerabilities, especially by ensuring the swift delivery of results through the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).\n\nUnderscoring a geostrategic and global approach to connectivity, we renew our commitment to implement the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), including by mobilizing up to 600 billion US-Dollars in public and private investments over the next five years.\n\n4. Iran\n\nWe, the G7 members, express our support for the fundamental aspiration of the people of Iran for a future where human security and their universal human rights are respected and protected. We condemn the violent death of the young Iranian woman \"Jina\" Mahsa Amini after her arrest by Irans so called \"morality police.\" We further condemn the brutal and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters and children. We urge Iranian authorities to honor their international obligations under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nWe advocate the right of all Iranians to access information, and we deplore the Iranian governments erosion of civil space, and independent journalism, its targeting of human rights defenders, including by shutting down the internet and social media. We urge the Iranian authorities to treat women as equal, respecting the universal rights provided to them under the relevant international human rights treaties. We also call on the Iranian authorities to release unjustly detained prisoners, including recently arrested protesters, children, journalists and human rights defenders, and ensure accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses. We will continue to use all available diplomatic measures to hold the Iranian authorities to account. We call on Iran to allow access to the country for relevant UN Human Rights Special Procedures mandate holders.\n\nWe strongly reject Irans practice of unfairly detaining dual and foreign citizens and call upon Iran to end the repellent practice of such unjust detentions in hopes of political gain.\n\nWe strongly support international efforts to hold Iran to account for its downing of PS752, which killed 176 innocent civilians. We demand that Iran fulfill its international legal obligations without delay.\n\nWe strongly condemn Irans continued destabilizing activities in and around the Middle East. These include Irans activities with both ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, and transfers of such advanced weaponry to state and non-state actors. Such proliferation is destabilizing for the region and escalates already high tensions. We urge Iran to cease its support to violent state and non-state actors and proxy groups and fully abide by all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), including UNSCR 2231. We also support efforts at the United Nations to hold Russia and Iran accountable for their blatant violations of UNSCR 2231.\n\nWe reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. The G7 will continue working together, and with other international partners, to address Irans nuclear escalation and insufficient cooperation with the IAEA regarding its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) safeguards agreement. We remain deeply concerned by the unabated expansion of Irans nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification. We call on Iran to change course and fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments in the field of nuclear non-proliferation without further delay. We note that despite many months of intense negotiations on a return to the JCPoA, Iran has not made the necessary decisions.\n\n5. Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n\nWe, the G7 members, strongly condemn the unprecedented series of unlawful ballistic missile launches conducted by the DPRK in 2022, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the intermediate-range ballistic missile launch on 4 October 2022, which was recklessly launched over Japan. These launches demonstrate the DPRKs continued efforts to expand its ballistic missile capabilities and are flagrant violations of multiple UNSCRs.\n\nWe reiterate our demand that the DPRK abandon its nuclear weapons, existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, in accordance with all relevant UNSCRs. We urge the DPRK to immediately halt its destabilizing activity, fully abide with all legal obligations under the relevant UNSCRs, and fully comply with the NPT and IAEA safeguards.\n\nAny nuclear test or other reckless action must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. We call on all states to fully and effectively implement all UNSCRs and vigilantly monitor, prevent, and penalize sanctions evading activities. We call on the DPRK to cease further escalation and engage in meaningful diplomacy concerning its unlawful nuclear and ballistic programs. We remain committed to working with all relevant partners toward the goal of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and upholding the rules-based international order.\n\nWe commend the work of the UNSC 1718 Committee, which has swiftly approved all COVID-19 related sanctions exemption requests for humanitarian assistance for the DPRK. We call on the DPRK to allow the re-establishment of UN and diplomatic access, in line with appropriate and reasonable COVID-19 regulations. We continue to condemn the DPRKs systematic widespread and gross human rights violations and abuses and urge the DPRK to cooperate with all relevant UN bodies and to resolve the abductions issue immediately. We remain gravely concerned regarding the humanitarian situation in the DPRK, which is the result of the DPRKs choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of its own people.\n\n6. Indo-Pacific\n\nWe, the G7 members, reiterate the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and based on the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, transparency, territorial integrity, and the peaceful and inclusive resolution of disputes. We are committed to protecting and promoting the rules-based international order, improving regional connectivity, strengthening free and fair trade, enhancing national resilience, supporting inclusive economic growth, promoting global health security, as well as confronting the climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity. We reaffirm our intention to work together with countries in the region and our support for the unity and centrality of ASEAN and commit to explore concrete cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).\n\n7. East and South China Seas\n\nWe remain seriously concerned about the situation in and around the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any moves that increase tensions and undermine regional stability and the rules-based international order. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and reaffirm UNCLOS important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, legally binding upon the parties, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes. We reaffirm the need to uphold the principle of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\n8. China\n\nWe, the G7 members, aim for constructive cooperation with China, where possible and in our interest, in particular on global challenges like peace and security, global health, the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources. These challenges can only be tackled successfully through cooperation within the rules-based international order.\n\nWe remind China of the need to uphold the principles of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes and to abstain from threats, coercion, intimidation, or the use of force. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic positions of G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies.\n\nWe will continue to raise our concerns with China on its reported human rights violations and abuses, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We reiterate our concerns over the continued erosion of Hong Kongs rights, freedoms and autonomy, and call on China to act in accordance with its international commitments and legal obligations.\n\nWe also call on China to treat foreign diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n\n9. Central Asia\n\nWe, the G7 members, discussed the multiple challenges facing the five Central Asian countries, ranging from the economic and geopolitical consequences of Russias war of aggression against Ukraine, to regional security issues and disputes, to climate change. We are committed to strengthening our cooperation with Central Asian countries and working with their governments and people on socio-economic development, respect for human rights, implementation of domestic and institutional reforms, as well as regional security. We will also work together to foster connectivity, transportation, and trade links.\n\n10. Africa\n\nWe, the G7 members, underscore the geopolitical and strategic importance of the African continent. Close cooperation with our African partners remains vital. Africa is particularly affected by multiple global crises such as the climate crisis, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition, energy insecurity, the socio-economic consequences of Russias war against Ukraine, democratic backsliding, and massive global economic headwinds. Our cooperation with and support for Africa are guided by the objectives of the AU Agenda 2063, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the principles of the UN Charter. We will continue to work with our African partners to build resilient and sustainable agri-food and energy systems, mitigate climate change, and address disinformation.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in quality infrastructure in Africa based on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, including through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We will continue to support regional manufacturing capacity for vaccines and other essential medical products supported by sustainable markets.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing deterioration of the political, security and humanitarian situation, including humanitarian access, in the Sahel. We are appalled by the violations and abuses of human rights against civilian populations, including those committed by terrorist groups and the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces in Mali. We call for accountability of all those responsible for human rights violations or abuses. We express our concern over the growing presence of Russian affiliated forces in Mali and elsewhere on the continent and their potentially destabilizing impact. We call for timely preparation of free and fair elections and comprehensive implementation of the transition charters in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, and reaffirm our support to the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union in this regard. We condemn the violence against protestors in Chad and the failure of that transitional government to adhere to African Union principles and communiques. We reiterate our strong commitment to support the populations of the Sahel countries, especially youth, and emphasize the need to work with people and governments of the littoral states in the Gulf of Guinea to strengthen their resilience to the threat of terrorism in a comprehensive way.\n\nWe remain concerned about peace and security in the Horn of Africa and the acute humanitarian needs, including famine in Somalia, and which disproportionally impact women and girls. We will work with the countries, institutions and civil society in the region to address these challenges. We welcome the announcement of the agreement reached by the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) brokered by the African Union, South Africa and Kenya, to settle the conflict in northern Ethiopia. We urge the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF to fully honor and implement this commitment. Human rights violations, atrocities and abuses must cease immediately. Perpetrators of these violations and abuses must be held to account; survivors and victims must obtain justice.\n\nWe commend Somalia on the election of a new government and call for a concerted international effort to support President Hassan Sheikh Mohamuds reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We firmly condemn the heinous attack by al-Shabaab on civilians on 29 October and express our heart-felt condolences to the families of the victims. More than one year after the military takeover in Sudan, we continue to urge the military to respect the commitment they made to withdraw from politics and maintain our call for a return to a civilian-led government based on broad support from the Sudanese people.\n\nWe are increasingly concerned by the ongoing, escalating violence and conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as well as regional tensions in the Great Lakes. We urge restraint by the M23 armed movement and call for a cessation of its current offensive. We welcome recent steps taken towards more stability in the region, including through talks with armed groups in the framework of the \"EAC DRC Peace Process\" and regional mediation by Angola. We call on all involved to participate in these efforts in good faith and to act in accordance with international law. We are convinced that only broad, multi-sectoral and cross-border cooperation can bring about lasting stability in the region.\n\n11. Haiti\n\nWe express our deep concern at the worsening humanitarian situation in Haiti, particularly the increased spread of cholera and the deepening food and fuel crisis. We condemn the violence perpetrated by armed groups and those who support them. They are terrorizing and holding the population hostage. We reiterate our commitment to support all efforts to quickly resolve the current security and humanitarian crisis. We call on all stakeholders in Haiti to restore order and security and to allow the delivery of the aid required to meet the urgent needs of the population. We commend the UNSC for adopting a sanctions regime on 21 October. We reiterate the importance of establishing the conditions necessary to allow for free and fair elections.",

Sullivan met last week with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior officials in Kyiv.\n\nBiden administration officials were alarmed when the Russians began to step up their public references to nuclear weapons last month and when, according to U.S. intelligence, senior Russian military leaders discussed the potential use of a tactical nuclear weapon in the event of further setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nBut the White House continued throughout October to downplay the actual risk of a nuclear attack, citing conversations with the Russian side in which the threat of a U.S. response was communicated.\n\n\"We have communicated directly, privately, at very high levels to the Kremlin, that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the United States and our allies will respond decisively. And we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,\" Sullivan told CBSs \"Face the Nation\" in an interview in late September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefense chiefs in the United States and Russia spoke for the first time in months when these concerns were at their peak. According to the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stressed to Russias defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, in late October \"the importance of maintaining lines of communication amid the ongoing war.\"\n\nJean-Pierres and Sullivans comments come as the U.S. expresses concern about a possible escalation from Russia and as Russian forces prepare for what could be a decisive battle for control over the Ukrainian city of Kherson.\n\nJean-Pierre said the exchanges did not center on Ukraine, but rather on how to prevent escalation in U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nShare this article Share\n\n\"We continue to adhere to our basic principle of nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, \" she said, referring to a U.S. policy that predates Russias invasion.\n\nSullivan said Monday that communicating with Russian officials is in the United States interest, but that administration officials are \"clear-eyed about who we are dealing with,\" according to the BBC. He did not say whether he was personally involved in the talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing U.S. and allied officials, previously reported that Sullivan engaged in recent months in confidential discussions with at least two Russian government officials aimed at reducing the risk of a spillover of the war in Ukraine and at dissuading the Russians from any possible nuclear weapon use.\n\nThe Post reported last week that the Biden administration has privately encouraged Ukrainian officials to show they are willing to engage in dialogue with Russia, in an acknowledgment of the growing frustration in some countries including among Republicans in the United States at the cost and duration of the war.\n\nOfficials in Kyiv have pushed back against the idea that they should be more willing to sit down with Russian officials to end the war. Zelensky said Monday that Ukraine has \"repeatedly proposed\" peace negotiations and \"always received insane Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House offered reassurance that it planned to continue to send military aid to Ukraine. \"The military assistance we give is so that when Ukraine does get to the negotiating table, it is in the strongest possible position, that military support, our economic support, our humanitarian support, our political support will continue,\" Karen Donfried, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday in the wake of a visit to Ukraine.",

The Kremlin brushed off any such meeting.\n\nZelenskyy listed conditions for the dialogue to begin, including the \"restoration of (Ukraines) territorial integrity ... compensation for all war damage, punishment for every war criminal and guarantees that it will not happen again.\"\n\nRussia, meanwhile, resumed calls for talks after Ukraines successful counteroffensive in the east and the south of the country began in September, but Ukraine has been rejecting the possibility ever since.\n\nRussias deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, stressed on Tuesday that Moscow is not setting any conditions for the resumption of talks with Ukraine and accused Kyiv of lacking \"good will.\"\n\n\"This is their choice, we have always declared our readiness for such negotiations,\" Rudenko said.\n\nUkraines presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak insisted in a tweet Monday that \"Ukraine has never refused to negotiate,\" but first, Russia needs to withdraw its troops from the country. \"Is Putin ready? Obviously not,\" Podolyak wrote.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nIn the eastern Donetsk region, which the Russians are struggling to take full control of, Moscows shelling killed three civilians and wounded seven others over the past 24 hours, according to Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nKyrylenko said the fatalities occurred in the city of Bakhmut, a key target of Russias grinding offensive in Donetsk, and the town of Krasnohorivka. Ukraines deputy defense minister last week described the Bakhmut area as \"the epicenter\" of fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, two civilians were seriously wounded by unexploded mines in Ukraines northeastern Kharkiv region, where Kyivs forces retook broad swaths of territory in September, Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\n\nIn the partially occupied Kherson region in the south, where Ukraines troops are conducting a successful counteroffensive, Russian-installed authorities said they have \"completed\" measures to evacuate residents ahead of anticipated Ukrainian advances.\n\nThe Kremlin-appointed administration had sought to relocate tens of thousands of people in anticipation of a Ukrainian advance deeper into the region. Ukrainian military and civilian officials have previously described the relocation measures as \"forced displacement.\" Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kremlin-backed administration, has repeatedly denied that.\n\nRussian-backed officials in Kherson announced that motorized ferries transporting civilians across the Dnieper River and deeper into Russian-held territory were no longer running. According to the announcement, made Monday on Telegram, the main remaining relocation route is across the Antonivskiy Bridge, which Ukrainian attacks have repeatedly damaged and is now operated by the Russian military.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations reassured Ukrainian farmers that extending a wartime deal that allowed Ukrainian grain and other commodities to be shipped on the Black Sea was a priority for the U.N. The agreement is set to expire on Nov. 19.\n\n\"I am here seeing Ukraine as the breadbasket of the world. ... This (war) really has had an impact on the entire global food market,\" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said while speaking to farmers and reporters at a grain storage facility in Kyiv.\n\nBrokered by the U.N. and Turkey, the shipping initiative has allowed more than 9 million tons of grain in 397 vessels to leave Ukrainian ports and travel along a designated corridor. Russia briefly suspended its participation in the deal last week, alleging that a Ukrainian drone had attacked its Black Sea fleet in Crimea on Oct. 29.",

Why is the U.S. nudging Ukraine on peace talks?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images\n\nRussia announced Friday morning that it has withdrawn all its troops from the key southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, marking another big setback for Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis is the latest military success for Ukraine since it launched a major offensive more than two months ago, giving it the clear momentum on the battlefield.\n\nYet President Biden and his top advisers are now nudging Ukraine to show a greater willingness to consider peace talks with Russia.\n\n\"There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably, in the true sense of the word, not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means,\" Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday.\n\n\"When there's an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it,\" Milley told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nThe general is among several administration officials to make remarks along these lines in recent days. U.S. officials say they are not forcing Ukraine into talks, or dictating any potential outcome.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, President Biden reiterated his position that the United States is \"not going to tell [Ukraine] what they have to do.\"\n\nThe president also said Russia's withdrawal from Kherson is evidence of \"some real problems with the Russian military.\"\n\nHe went on to say that the warring sides may recalibrate their positions over the winter, when the fighting is expected to slow. And, Biden added, \"it remains to be seen whether or not there'll be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia.\"\n\nU.S. officials acknowledge that neither Ukraine nor Russia appear ready to hold serious negotiations. But the Americans would like Ukraine to ease its adamant opposition to talks with Russia, believing negotiations will be required at some point.\n\nRussia and Ukraine held a few brief rounds of talks shortly after Russia invaded in February. But the discussions went nowhere, quickly broke down, and there's been no sign they're about to restart.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week repeated the his conditions before negotiations could take place. He said all Russian forces must leave Ukraine, Russia must pay damages caused by the war, Moscow must punish war criminals, and there must be guarantees that Russia will never invade again.\n\n\"We have proposed negotiations numerous times, to which we always received crazy Russian responses, terrorist attacks, shellings or blackmail,\" the Ukrainian president said.\n\nWhen Russia annexed four Ukrainian regions in September, Zelenskyy said he would never negotiate with Putin.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mikhail Metzel/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images Mikhail Metzel/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"We will negotiate with the next Russian president,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy made no mention of Putin in his most recent remarks, and some observers interpreted this as a slight shift in Ukraine's position, even if it wasn't stated explicitly.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said Russia is \"ready for negotiations, taking into consideration the realities formed at a current moment.\"\n\nHowever, she did not offer any compromises that Russia might be willing to make.\n\nUkrainians say this follows a familiar pattern, with Russia offering to negotiate or take a pause when it is doing poorly and looking for a chance to regroup militarily.\n\nThe significance of Kherson\n\nKherson was one of Russia's few successes in the war. Russian forces faced virtually no resistance in the first days of the war as they captured the city on the Dnipro River.\n\nThis was seen as part of a broader Russian effort to take control of Ukraine's entire Black Sea coast, which is used to export the country's agricultural products, the foundation of its economy.\n\nNow the Russians have left Kherson without a fight, though the move was clearly in response to Ukrainian forces that had been steadily advancing toward the city for the past two months.\n\nAnalysts say no such move could be made without Putin's approval, though the Russian leader has yet to comment publicly.\n\nThis is the third major retreat by Russian troops this year.\n\nA large Russian force approached the capital Kyiv, the country's largest city, in the first days of the war in February, but pulled back a month later at the end of March.\n\nThe Russians also neared the second largest city, Kharkiv, in the north, before pulling back in May.\n\nUkraine's cautious reaction\n\nDespite Russia's withdrawal announcement, Ukrainians are still proceeding cautiously, wary of any possible Russian traps.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainian troops have reclaimed more than 40 villages in the southern part of the country as they move toward Kherson. However, neither Zelenskyy nor other top officials have commented on the status of Kherson city itself.\n\nOn social media, meanwhile, many Ukrainians were already celebrating.\n\nIn several villages, videos showed eldering residents, who had been under Russian occupation for months, greeting the Ukrainian soldiers with hugs, kisses and tears.\n\nOne video showed a young woman playing a violin in the street as soldiers drove up to her.\n\nAnd a photo from Kherson showed a Ukrainian flag raised at the city's main government building. There was no word on who raised it, though plenty of speculation that it was the work of a Ukrainian civilian who had remained in the city during the Russian occupation.",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nA previous media report, in The Washington Post, said Washington was privately encouraging Ukraine to signal an openness to negotiate with Russia, as the State Department said Moscow was escalating the war and did not seriously wish to engage in peace talks.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, said the request by U.S. officials was not aimed at pushing Ukraine to the negotiating table, but a calculated attempt to ensure Kyiv maintains the support of other countries.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told RFE/RL it was absurd to suggest that Western countries that are supplying Ukraine with weapons would push Kyiv to negotiate on Moscow's terms.\n\n\"Ukraine receives from its partners, first of all from the United States, quite effective weapons,\" he said. \"We are pushing the Russian Army out of territory. And against this background, forcing us to the negotiation process, and in fact to recognize the ultimatum of the Russian Federation, is nonsense! And no one will do that.\"\n\nHe said suggestions the West was pushing Ukraine to negotiate were part of Russia's \"information program,\" though he did not directly rebut a report in The Washington Post.\n\nZelenskiy said in his nightly address on November 7 that he was open to talks with Russia, but only \"genuine\" negotiations that would restore Ukraine's borders, grant it compensation for Russian attacks, and punish those responsible for war crimes.\n\nZelenskiy signed a decree on October 4 formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"impossible\" but leaving the door open to talks with Russia.\n\nSullivan told a public event in New York that the Biden administration had \"an obligation to pursue accountability\" and pledged to work with international partners to \"hold the perpetrators of grave and grotesque war crimes in Ukraine responsible for what they have done.\"\n\nSullivan did not elaborate on the communication channels that Washington and Moscow maintained, but insisted that U.S. officials were \"clear-eyed about who we are dealing with,\" the BBC reported.\n\nSullivan travelled to Kyiv on November 4 and pledged Washington's \"unwavering and unflinching\" support for Ukraine.\n\nHis unannounced visit coincided with an announcement the same day by the U.S. Defense Department of another shipment of weapons to Ukraine worth $400 million.\n\n\"I was just in Kyiv on Friday and I had the opportunity to meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy and my counterpart Andriy Yermak, with the military leadership and also to get a briefing on just what level of death and devastation has been erupted by Putin's war on that country,\" Sullivan was quoted by the BBC as saying on November 7.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the U.S. media reports.\n\n\"I've seen those reportings. So, you know -- and, look, people claim a lot of things about conversations that we -- that the United States has or doesn't have,\" Jean-Pierre told a news briefing on November 7. \"I don't have any specific conversations to read out to you.\"\n\nThe secretary of Ukraine's Security Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said on November 8 that the \"main condition\" for the resumption of negotiations with Russia would be the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nDanilov said on Twitter that Ukraine also needed the \"guarantee\" of modern air defenses, aircraft, tanks, and long-range missiles.\n\nAccording to the report in The Wall Street Journal, Sullivan held confidential conversations in recent months with Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev that were not disclosed publicly.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on November 7 that while Russia remained \"open\" to talks, it was unable to negotiate with Kyiv due to its refusal to hold talks with Russia.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters",

                "cc_text": "With Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine currently in its ninth month, the ongoing war is high on the agenda as Americans prepare to vote in next weeks midterm elections. The US has led international efforts to bolster the Ukrainian fight back against Kremlin aggression and has provided Ukraine with crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support, but recent statements from both sides of the political divide indicate that this support cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe most widely reported comments came from senior Republican and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who indicated in early October that a future Republican-controlled Congress would not be prepared to offer Ukraine any more \"blank checks.\" Meanwhile, a letter sent to President Biden by a group of 30 progressive Democrat lawmakers calling for a Ukraine ceasefire push was hastily withdrawn in late October following a strong backlash.\n\nWhile the political debate continues, survey data indicates strong US public backing for policies in support of Ukraine. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in early October found that 73% of Americans believed the United States should maintain support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, 66% of respondents said Washington specifically should continue providing weapons to Ukraine, up from 51% in a similar poll two months earlier. The latest University of Maryland poll reached similar conclusions.\n\nWith the outcome of Russias Ukraine war still very much in the balance, the coming US vote has the potential to shape the geopolitical landscape for the coming years. The Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their views on what the midterm elections might mean for Ukraine.\n\nDaniel Fried, Distinguished Fellow, Atlantic Council: If the Republicans take Congress (or even one House), the domestic political dynamic in Washington will shift toward confrontation with Republicans spending time on investigators, allegations, and accusations.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Republicans will be split between neo-Reaganist and Trumpist wings. Both will attack the Biden Administration and push it to be tougher on China and Iran. Both wings will also push for greater burden sharing (meaning defense spending) by US allies. The neo-Reaganites will urge more push back against Putin while the Trumpists will either argue for pulling back from support for Ukraine or, in extreme cases, argue that accommodation with Russia is in the US national interest. Their stance will resemble the \"isolationist\" position of indifference to Hitlers rise in the late 1930s.\n\nThe Democrats and neo-Reaganite Republicans will generally support Ukraine. Democrats may split, with a few hard left Democrats taking positions similar to Republicans who want to distance the US from Ukraine. But they will be few in number. Republicans who oppose continued aid to Ukraine will be larger in number. But Congress is unlikely to follow their lead.\n\nCalls for negotiations on Putins terms, meaning that the US should push Ukraine to surrender its people and land to Russia, will grow but are unlikely to prevail as long as Putin keeps demanding the fruits of victory over Ukraine that he has not and may never attain. In short, US support for Ukraine will continue as Russian atrocities continue and as Ukrainians continue to resist effectively.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nSuriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy learned the hard way in 2019 how much domestic US politics can affect Ukraines reality. He and his team would be right to worry about next weeks polls. Whether or not the GOP will follow through on its threats to scale back Ukraine aid is impossible to predict, but it is definitely a real possibility.\n\nThis was Putins plan all along. He has aimed to cause an energy crisis that would drive up inflation and thereby trigger popular dissatisfaction that would result in the fall of governments and leaders opposed to him and his war in Ukraine. If the Republicans take the House and proceed to cut or reduce US support for Ukraine, they will be acting in Putins interests. Let us hope that threats to do so are campaign posturing and nothing more.\n\nIt is possible to argue that US President Joe Biden and his advisors have fallen short in their handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless, helping Putin in his self-proclaimed genocidal conquest of an emerging European democracy is absolutely the wrong way to voice legitimate criticisms of US foreign policy. Whatever the outcome of the midterm elections, the US must not enable Putin.\n\nKristina Hook, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University: American public opinion on Ukraine is remarkably bipartisan and durable, with 73% of Americans agreeing in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll that the US should continue to support Ukraine despite Russias nuclear saber-rattling. Two-thirds of Americans say they are closely following the war, which is particularly notable as coverage has declined and reporting has transitioned away from gripping human interest stories to focus on important military dynamics.\n\nThese numbers imply that consensus surrounding Ukraine has held throughout the routine politicization of an election cycle. Regardless of the midterm results, I therefore expect the majority of US politicians across the aisle to reflect the public sentiment of their voters, who correctly understand the moral stakes of Russias brutal violence against Ukrainians.\n\nAs the politicking of the US election cycle declines after the midterms, I expect an increase in bipartisan articulations of the strategic importance of a clear Russian defeat for the preservation of the rules-based global order that underpins US political stability and economic success. Ukraines struggle for independence from a ruthless adversary resonates with American voters, yet a key post-midterm question remains if and how new and returning Congressional leaders will convey the national security impetus for Ukraines victory.\n\nDoug Klain, Nonresident Fellow, Atlantic Council: Support for Ukraine is one of the few issues that has managed to remain largely bipartisan in the United States. Regardless of the midterm elections, the American public is still overwhelmingly in favor of continued aid to Ukraine. Its also likely that the majority of Congress will remain in favor of further aid to Ukraine, no matter the outcome on November 8.\n\nThats the good news. However, within both parties there are prominent voices calling for a shift in policy that would embolden Russia and put Ukraine in a worse position at the negotiating table, when that day eventually arrives. This is the reason why the Biden Administration is reportedly mulling a legislative blitz during the lame-duck session to lock in another critical package of Ukraine aid. Weve seen in the past how vocal minorities in Congress have been able to gum up the works and stop major legislation from sailing smoothly to the Presidents desk. Continued aid for Ukraine may become a target if these factions grow their numbers in Congress.\n\nWhile the consensus in Washington is likely to remain in favor of steadfast support for Ukraine, a more vocal opposition to aid means that Ukraines friends need to step up efforts to communicate with the American public about why this aid is in the interests of the US. This means making clear that Ukraines success is also a win for the United States.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

United Nations country teams play a critical role in supporting countries with a long-term perspective, she said, adding that this is especially important during transitions such as in Cte dIvoire, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau in the recent past, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the near future.\n\nBankole Adeoye, Commissioner for Political Affairs and Peace and Security, African Union Commission, said the complex challenges faced by the Sahel, \"the underbelly of insecurity in Africa today\", and coastal West African States require coordinated multiple responses that address both unfolding threats and structural causes. He underscored the need for adequate, predictable, flexible and sustainable funding, through United Nations-assessed contributions; committed funds from bilateral partners; and programmatic funding to United Nations country teams.\n\nMary Robinson, Chair of The Elders, said the war on Ukraine has fully exposed the inability of the Council to respond to an aggression by a permanent member against a non-nuclear, sovereign State. Expressing support for the principle of enabling regional organizations, such as the African Union, to take a leading role in conflict prevention and resolution, she stressed that peace operations must draw on and complement the insights and experience of staff working in all parts of the Organization at the country level.\n\nAlso briefing the Council was Karin Landgren, Executive Director of the Security Council Report, who observed that the Council has moved towards greater acknowledgement of underlying causes and drivers of conflict in its discussions and in mandating. Underscoring the need to safeguard peace operations hard-fought achievements, she said Council members could conduct visiting missions to countries where peace operations have closed and invite the country concerned to present progress in areas of the former mandate at one-, three- and five-year marks after mission closure.\n\nDuring the open debate, nearly 50 ministers and representatives some from conflict-afflicted States or regions shared their perspectives and ideas on how to enhance the Organizations peace operations so it can effectively build resilience in the vulnerable countries where they operate. Many speakers highlighted the critical and oft repeated need to tackle root causes and drivers of conflict and called on the Council, in its ongoing consideration of those issues, to actively consult with the Peacebuilding Commission.\n\nShirley Ayorkor Botchwey, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration of Ghana, which holds the Council presidency in November, was among those who urged coherent action across the United Nations system, targeted at the resilience-building agenda for sustainable peace. United Nations peace operations must be urgently reconfigured to ensure a balance between actions aimed at restoring peace, including through combating terrorism, and measures to address the underlying causes of conflict, she said, calling on the Council to take up the recommendation of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations in that regard.\n\nEchoing that point was Kenya's representative, who emphasized that the Council cannot afford to dissociate peace operations from counter-terrorism, especially in the protection of civilians and provision of a basic level of security in countries where it is deployed. Noting that peacekeeping is an innovation of the Council that was not contemplated when the Charter of the United Nations was first agreed, he stressed that it must continue to innovate. Highlighting his countrys long experience as a troop contributor, he called on the Council to embrace United Nations-assessed contributions to support African Union operations.\n\nIrelands representative was among many delegates who emphasized that women and youth must be placed front and centre of national and regional responses right at the start, not as an afterthought. For this reason, his country has made the women, peace and security agenda a key focus throughout its time on the Council, he said.\n\nBrazils representative said building resilience in vulnerable countries is necessary; however, achieving this goal must not be a burden placed solely on peace operations. Joining other delegations, he pointed out that the peacebuilding role must be balanced with realistic and clear mandates, cautioning that excessively ambitious, vague and open-ended mandates can result in frustration among partners and the population in the host country.\n\nChinas representative emphasized that peacebuilding efforts must be integrated into efforts to foster development, pointing to steps taken to that end by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), where the Deputy Head of Mission also functions as Resident Coordinator, enabling the integration of development and security concerns.\n\nSeveral delegates including Egypt, Austria and Japan called for greater cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission. Canadas representative highlighted that the strength of the Peacebuilding Commission is that everything is done at the request and with the consent of the countries and regions. \"The PBC [Peacebuilding Commission] speaks with countries, not just about them,\" he emphasized, adding that there is deep value in the advice that the Commission can offer to the Council.\n\nOn that note, many speakers underscored the importance of respecting national and local ownership and priorities in peacebuilding efforts. Sudans representative, drawing on his countrys experience, said peacebuilding efforts should endeavour to achieve peace by linking the international peacebuilding process to local political and cultural and social actors. He called on United Nations country teams, as well as international financial institutions, to provide the necessary support for the countrys transition and peacebuilding.\n\nA representative of the European Union joined other delegations in stressing the need for sustainable funding. The bloc is among the biggest contributors to the Peacebuilding Fund, providing more than 60 per cent of funding to the mechanism, he added. Portugals representative said her country has supported Mozambique in tackling the armed conflict in Cabo Delgado, providing training to its armed forces as well as support for its justice, security and defence sectors. She expressed hope that a decision will be made soon to ensure predictable and sustainable financing for African Union-led operations\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of the United States, Gabon, India, Mexico, United Kingdom, Norway, Albania, France, Russian Federation, United Arab Emirates, Republic of Korea, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand, Malta, Ecuador, Sweden (on behalf of Nordic Countries), Slovakia, Netherlands, Chile, Tunisia, South Africa, Algeria, Peru, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Poland, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Argentina, Indonesia, Lebanon, Nigeria and Germany.\n\nThe meeting began at 10:03 a.m., suspended at 1:07 p.m., resumed at 3 p.m. and ended at 4:50 p.m.\n\nBriefings\n\nANTNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the local and global contexts in which the Organizations peace operations function are becoming more challenging by the day. Rising geopolitical tensions; spreading insecurity; escalating climate catastrophes; worsening hunger and poverty; deepening inequalities; spreading violent misogyny, misinformation and disinformation; and waning trust in institutions are fueling political tensions, economic despair and social unrest. Unconstitutional changes of Government are proliferating alongside inter-State conflicts, invasions and wars, while entrenched divides between world Powers continue to limit the international communitys ability to collectively respond. The chasm between humanitarian needs and humanitarian assistance keeps widening as human rights and the rule of law are under assault. Meanwhile, the international community can barely comprehend and lacks the global architecture to contain the risks of cyberwarfare and lethal autonomous weapons. \"Our world is transforming at breakneck speed. We must keep pace to keep peace,\" he urged.\n\nPeacebuilding gains on the African continent and elsewhere are reversing, he pointed out, noting that the New Agenda for Peace proposed in his report Our Common Agenda will prioritize investment in prevention and peacebuilding. United Nations peace operations must be empowered and equipped to play a greater role in sustaining peace at all stages of conflict and in all its dimensions. This requires committed, inclusive national ownership that considers the needs of the most vulnerable, and, above all, development and respect for all human rights the worlds best preventive tools against violent conflict and instability. Highlighting priorities for action, he said the international community must deepen engagement with local communities and promote more responsive inclusive Governments and institutions. Peace operations, which are manifestations of the political leverage of the Security Council, create space for dialogue and political participation, reduce community violence, secure the delivery of basic services, encourage reconciliation and promote equal access to justice. He urged quicker and more effective action to address needs and grievances, as well as a strengthened whole-of-society approach and increased investments that build trust, community engagement and cohesion.\n\nThe international community must also bolster the leadership of women and youth in shaping the future of their countries and ensure they benefit from peace and development gains, he continued. As securing womens rights and equal participation in decision-making is essential to building and maintaining peace, the United Nations is investing in partnerships with local women leaders and peacebuilders, including by increasing the number of women personnel at all levels. The Organization is also pursuing policies that guarantee full gender parity and women leadership, including through quotas across election monitoring, security sector reform, disarmament and justice systems. The voices of young people articulating peacebuilding priorities must also be heard loud and clear. The United Nations Youth, Peace and Security agenda, together with the African Unions 2020 Continental Framework on Youth, Peace and Security, are important complementary tools to amplify these critical voices.\n\nHe said that another priority is a more integrated and holistic approach to building resilience and sustaining peace, with tailored investments across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus. That means strengthening synergies across the range of peace work from conflict prevention and resolution to peacekeeping, peacebuilding and long-term development; deepening partnerships between the United Nations, African Union and other regional organizations, as well as with international and regional financial institutions; and better integrating the work of United Nations country teams mandates with those of peace operations, particularly in transition contexts. Turning to the crucial question of finance, he said prevention and peacebuilding are cost-effective and save lives, yet the international community continues to underinvest in peace. The General Assemblys Financing for Peacebuilding reflects a commitment to find solutions for increased and more sustainable funding. The Peacebuilding Fund continues to be an invaluable resource, he added, noting that in 2021 it provided $150 million to 25 countries in Africa. Needs far outpace resources however, he pointed out, stressing that funding must be scaled up and partnerships with international financial institutions strengthened.\n\n\"The Security Council plays a critical role in supporting the efforts of United Nations peace operations to build resilience and sustain peace. By acting early, engaging strategically and speaking with one voice, the Council can mobilize the international communitys political and financial support and foster the commitment of conflict actors to secure peace,\" he said.\n\nMARTHA AMA AKYAA POBEE, Assistant Secretary-General for Africa in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, stated that the nature of todays crises calls for renewed efforts to preserve the trust of the affected civilians in international and regional partners, particularly the United Nations, to help preserve peace. To ensure the success of peace operations, she stressed the importance of inclusive strategies that consider the entire spectrum peace of from prevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping to peacebuilding and development. This will also require the mobilization and engagement of all related actors, she added, working together in an integrated and coordinated manner.\n\nPointing out that the Council has a vital role in this regard, she stressed that peace operations need clear, realistic and up-to-date mandates, with well-identified priorities, adequate sequencing and flexibility to evolve over time. Noting that building resilience requires responses that are part of wider political strategies and are mindful of the socioeconomic realities and needs, she highlighted that the ongoing assessment of the high-level independent panel in the Sahel should offer some useful elements. While solutions should be based on a national vision and be inclusive, she emphasized that \"truly holistic and integrated solutions cannot rest on expediency\". They must recognize the needs and contributions of all segments of society, including women and youth, as agents of peace and developments, she added.\n\nShe went on to state that the United Nations country teams play a critical role in supporting countries with a long-term perspective, and this is especially important during transitions such as in Cte d'Ivoire, Liberia and Guinea Bissau in the recent past, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the near future. She further highlighted the need to engage in strong collective action and enhance collaboration and partnerships with regional and subregional organizations, financial institutions, civil society and the business community. Stressing the importance of working closely with financial institutions, she underscored that the World Banks Gulf of Guinea Northern Region Social Cohesion Project offers a good example of how they can complement United Nations efforts.\n\nBANKOLE ADEOYE, Commissioner for Political Affairs and Peace and Security, African Union Commission, addressing the Council by teleconference from Abuja, where he had been attending a forum on African Union Peace Support Operations and the African Standby Force, noted that drivers of conflict on the continent include structural economic dependence, climate shocks and insecurity, uneven development and sociopolitical and economic exclusion. The resultant high-level of discontent needs to be tackled through rapid structural transformation, he said. Against this backdrop, the Council could adopt a whole-of-organization approach in implementing mandates for peace operations in Africa, which are multidimensional in nature, he said, underscoring the need to ensure that country teams accompany deployed missions as early as possible.\n\nHe went on to outline other ways to accompany critical political transitions with a view to building resilience, spotlighting the African Unions collaborative arrangement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to create a facility for accompanying critical political transitions. He urged Council members to support the African Union-United Nations facility to support inclusive transition, and expressed hope that the upcoming high-level inter-institutional consultations between the two bodies in December will strengthen effective collaboration. The Union engages meaningfully with regional mechanisms to enhance its ability to enhance rapid response to threats in their respective subregions, while engaging collaboratively with the United Nations and other partners, including in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Somalia, he said. He added that it is also committed to strategic engagement with the Organization on early warning and conflict prevention, in line with the Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for Enhancing Partnership in Peace and Security, signed in 2017.\n\nTurning to the Sahel, which he called \"the underbelly of insecurity in Africa today\", he said the complex challenges faced by that region and coastal West African States require coordinated multiple responses that address both unfolding threats and structural causes. In coastal West African countries, which experience unconstitutional changes of Government, support is needed for resilience. To this end, he underscored the need for adequate, predictable, flexible and sustainable funding, through United Nations-assessed contributions; committed funds from bilateral partners; and programmatic funding to United Nations country teams. Further, adequate resources should be provided to the planned African Union-UNDP critical political transitions facility, to support its efforts to ensure the territorial integrity and institutional resilience building of the affected States.\n\nMARY ROBINSON, Chair of The Elders, the group of independent global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela 15 years ago, recalled Kofi Annans words that \"the human family will not enjoy development without security, will not enjoy security without development and will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.\" Calling on the Security Council to play a more proactive role and promote a \"whole of UN\" approach that supports just and sustainable peace, she said that peace operations must draw on and complement the insights and experience of staff working in all parts of the Organization at the country level. As a former Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes in Africa, she said, she has no illusions as to how challenging this is, \"but am equally aware of the risks of failure and fatalism\".\n\nThe war on Ukraine, she continued, has fully exposed the inability of the Council to respond to an aggression by a permanent member against a non-nuclear, sovereign State. Expressing support for the principle of enabling regional organizations such as the African Union to take a leading role in conflict prevention and resolution, she also underscored the importance of a more holistic focus on the underlying causes of conflict, from political and economic instability to poverty, inequality and marginalization of minorities within countries. Welcoming the women, peace and security agenda, she pointed out that the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Womens (UN-Women) analysis shows that in cases where females were able to exercise a strong influence on the negotiation process, there was a much higher chance that an agreement would be reached. Noting that peace missions are pushing for greater representation of women in national security and defense sectors, she called for action to counter reprisals that women peacebuilders and human rights defenders face.\n\nHighlighting the climate crisis as a threat multiplier and driver of conflict, she noted some modest steps towards integrating climate considerations into peacebuilding operations, for instance with the appointment of an environment adviser to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM). Similar roles should be considered for other peace operations, she stressed, noting that in 2021, 6 of the 10 biggest peace operations, and over 80 per cent of personnel, were deployed in countries highly exposed to climate change. Somalia is facing its third famine in 11 years, she said, adding that on 29 October at least 100 people were killed by explosions in Mogadishu, but the world barely noticed. \"These were mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandparents leaving grieving families, targeted by Al-Shabaab extremists,\" she said, adding that the links between conflict and climate are also evident in Tigray and northern Ethiopia. Calling for sustained engagement to tackle the root causes of conflict, she called on the Council to focus on building a just and sustainable peace.\n\nKARIN LANDGREN, Executive Director of the Security Council Report, said peace operations fit for contemporary times need new approaches that include responsiveness to the underlying causes and drivers of conflict. The Council has moved towards greater acknowledgement of those unaddressed structural factors, including non-traditional threats, in its discussions and in its mandating, she noted. In Haiti, the 15-member organ has increasingly voiced concern about the deleterious effects of gang violence and other criminal activities and recently established a sanctions regime while also stressing that addressing the root causes of instability in the country requires political solutions. Many past Council resolutions have referred to organized crime, as well as corruption, in Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Iraq, among other situations, she pointed out. In addition, the Council has frequently supported transitional justice initiatives, including in the peace operations in the Central African Republic and Colombia, and has associated this area of work with addressing root causes of conflict. Stressing that every peace operation needs to consider factors that could trigger or re-trigger conflict, she recalled the Councils resolution that cited social exclusion in Liberia.\n\nNot every structural problem will lead to conflict, however, she pointed out, noting that the Councils consideration of those issues is part and parcel of bringing resilience-building to the forefront of peace operations. Underscoring the need to safeguard peace operations hard-fought achievements, she said the Council could \"check back in\" with the country concerned from time to time and invite it to present on progress in areas of the former mandate at one-, three- and five-year marks after mission closure, for example. Council members could also conduct visiting missions to countries where peace operations have closed. Integrating structural and societal factors into the work of peace operations must be based on understanding not just the countrys history but also its politics, conflict, economy and the levers of informal power within its society. The recommendations of the 2015 High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, which observed that \"more often than not\" peace operations did not address \"root causes and conflict drivers\" effectively, remain highly relevant to devising better approaches to peace operations. While no peace operation is expected to address every issue, the international community must reflect and speak to the full intricate context in which those operations intervene, she said.\n\nStatements\n\nSHIRLEY AYORKOR BOTCHWEY, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration of Ghana , stated that there is an overwhelming and urgent need for United Nations peace operations to be reconfigured to ensure a balance between \"kinetic\" actions aimed at restoring peace, including through combating terrorism, and \"non-kinetic\" measures to address the underlying causes of conflict. She also called on the Council to deal with the recommendation from the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations report on the need for new modalities to deal with terrorism and violent extremism. Noting that women and youth are disproportionately impacted by conflict and violence, she pointed to the need to operationalize the Councils agendas on youth and women, making them essential pillars of the United Nations support for resilience-building. It is important for this Council to encourage coherent action across the United Nations system targeted at the resilience-building agenda for sustainable peace, she stressed.\n\nLINDA THOMAS GREENFIELD ( United States ) underlined the importance of ensuring that modern United Nations peace operations are multidimensional, welcoming in this regard, the Secretary-Generals Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative. She affirmed the vital role of peace operations in supporting local stakeholders in effectuating political solutions, and in tackling the root causes of conflict. Touching on the Councils efforts to implement a longer-term strategic vision to accompany peace operations in Mali and South Sudan, she said that leaders of such operations say they can function much more effectively when they have a clear sense of what the Council expects them to achieve. However, she emphasized the need for the support and cooperation of host countries in the full implementation of mandates. Further, such operations cannot alone address the drivers of conflict, which are generational challenges and require many actors to come to the table, she said, underscoring the need for the meaningful inclusion of women and girls, as well as young people. The Peacebuilding Commission also plays an important convening role to play in international peacebuilding efforts.\n\nHERMAN IMMONGAULT, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon , highlighting the Secretary-Generals reforms aimed at reducing fragmentation within the United Nations peace and security architecture as well as within peacekeeping operations themselves, called on the Council to consider new security trends and the changing nature of conflict. It is essential to strengthen the resilience of peacekeeping operations, he said, calling for a multidimensional approach, due diligence on human rights and better management of \"blue helmets\". Strengthening cooperation between the Council and the Peacebuilding Commission is vital, he said, highlighting the need for improved transitions. Rebuilding a county is a delicate exercise, he said, and noting that his country hosts a subregional mechanism that aims at early warning and prevention of conflict in central Africa, called for capacity-building and financial resources to ensure that this mechanism can be fully operational.\n\nTHOMAS BYRNE, Minister of State for European Affairs of Ireland , emphasized that for peace to be resilient and sustainable, it must be inclusive and locally owned. As such, his country has made the women, peace and security agenda a key focus throughout its time on the Council. The youth, peace and security agenda also has the potential to be transformative, he added, stressing the need for proper investment in that regard. Women and youth must be placed front and centre of national and regional responses right at the start, not as an afterthought, he underscored. Further, human rights violations must be addressed, he said, noting that in so doing, violence and insecurity, radicalization and the growth of terrorism can be mitigated. The Council has increasingly incorporated climate-related security risks into its peacekeeping mandates and its important work in that regard must continue. The international community must enhance efforts to ensure adequate, predictable and sustained funding for peacebuilding.\n\nVINAY KWATRA, Foreign Secretary of India , spoke of the changing, complex nature of conflict, where the security environment is fragmented, and characterized by breakdown in the rule of law, absence of effective State institutions, proliferation of illicit economic activities and illegal exploitation of natural resources. Peace operations now handle multidimensional tasks, including capacity-building of host Governments in the security sector and monitoring of human rights violations, which often comes at the cost of ignoring the underlying causes of conflict. He underlined that peace operations can create conditions for political and social processes to take hold, but not replace them. Noting that India is among the largest troop-contributing countries to United nations peace operations, he pointed out that attempts to extend the role of peacekeeping missions to peacebuilding tasks will strengthen neither and weaken both. Further, he underscored the need for national authorities to drive priorities to sustain peace, and for peacebuilding efforts to be given predictable and sustainable financing.\n\nMARTIN KIMANI ( Kenya ), expressing support for the Secretary-Generals A4P and A4P+ initiatives, said that peacekeepers are increasingly pitted against determined terrorist groups. Noting that peacekeeping is an innovation of the Council that was not contemplated when the Charter of the United Nations was first agreed, he stressed that it must continue to innovate. The Council cannot afford to dissociate peace operations from counter-terrorism, especially in the protection of civilians and the provision of a basic level of security in countries where it is deployed. Highlighting his countrys long experience as a troop contributor, he said that voluntary and ad hoc arrangements hinder proper planning and operations. Calling on the Council to move beyond \"circuitous debates\", he said it must embrace United Nations-assessed contributions to support African Union operations. Stressing that the safety of peacekeepers is critical but so is the protection of civilians, he underscored the need for deliberate, credible and continuous analysis of the conflict environment. \"The conflict map should always be up to date and ready for peacekeepers to have a clear operational picture,\" he said.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) said that, to address and prevent conflicts, structural causes, such as exclusion, poverty, discrimination, inequality and corruption, must be addressed. This can only be achieved through strengthening rule of law and governance, sustainable development and national reconciliation and ensuring victims rights to justice. In that regard, peacekeeping operations must truly include all sectors of society in every step of peace processes. The way transitions are organized is a determining factor in whether they lead to stability or relapse into violence, he pointed out, calling on the Council to ensure that mandates of peace operations are sufficiently flexible and cover post-conflict phases. Also needed are further understanding of the linkages between peacekeeping and peacebuilding, strengthening support for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes; security sector reforms; transitional justice; and mental health services and psychosocial support for victims. A peace operation will have been successful if, upon its departure, it leaves behind sufficiently robust national structures to provide basic services and guarantee the rights of the population, he said.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) underlined the need for peace operations to focus on their core mandate: resolving hotspot issues to foster peace, despite the increasingly wide-ranging nature of their responsibilities, and should strengthen cooperation with United Nations and regional organizations to this end. Support must be lent to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts and to promote social reconciliation, to provide a basis for sustainable peace. Further, peacebuilding efforts must be integrated into efforts to foster development, which is the \"cornerstone of peace and security\", he said, touching on steps taken to this end by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), where the Deputy Head of Mission also functions as Resident Coordinator, enabling the integration of development and security concerns. He underlined the need for strengthened coordination across United Nations agencies to better support countries needs, including through assistance to humanitarian agencies to provide security guarantees. He went on to recall a presidential statement presented by China at the Council in August, which called on the Secretary-General to present a report by 31 August 2023 to assess peace operations and provide recommendations in this regard.\n\nBARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ), noting that peace operations need to better coordinate with wider peacebuilding work, stressed that they need the capabilities to understand conflict drivers and feed analysis into the wider United Nations strategy. Highlighting her countrys support for Peace and Development Advisers, whose expertise could be used in mission settings, she said the Council must also encourage full use of the Organizations strategic planning and operating frameworks, and instruments such as the Global Focal Point for the Rule of Law. Coordinated investment in peace is critical, she said, adding that the Peacebuilding Fund is a key tool for bringing together different parts of the Organizations system. Further, investing in prevention is essential, as is strengthening womens roles in conflict prevention and resolution for lasting peace and security, she added.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ) stressed that support for political solutions must be at the centre of all peacekeeping, pointing out that lasting peace can neither be achieved nor sustained by military means alone. The Council must enhance the link between peacekeeping and peacebuilding when planning and mandating peace operations, she emphasized, noting that the current efforts in the Sahel illustrate the need for holistic solutions to deal with growing insecurity, while addressing root causes of conflict. Innovative thinking and renewed partnerships bringing out the best of the United Nations, African Union and regional complementarity are also needed. As such, her country strongly and actively supports the United Nations and African Union-initiated High-Level Panel on Security, Development and Governance in the Sahel. For truly sustainable peace, the Council must also ensure that peace operations facilitate the participation of women. Local women, womens organizations and civil society groups unique insights and intergenerational knowledge should be included in all stages of developing preventive policies, including early warning mechanisms.\n\nFERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), stressing that conflict prevention has remained a \"weak and frustrating point\" of this Council and the entire Organization, stressed the need to do integrate various dimensions including security, development and human rights into the core United Nations missions. Noting that local ownership is crucial, he stated that dialogue with all interested parties, including local communities, is key to successful peacebuilding actions. Pointing to the importance of strategic communication and transparency of information, he emphasized that any distortion of information may prove detrimental to peacekeeping efforts. Spotlighting the Regional Youth Cooperation Organization, which aims to promote reconciliation among youth in the Western Balkans, he underscored the need to include the promotion of women into peace and security agendas. On climate action, he noted that \"failing to see a link between climate change and security is sleepwalking towards the fire\".\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) underlined the need for enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union, spotlighting in this regard the two organizations conferring responsibility to former Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou to assess the future security architecture for the Sahel. France supports regular assessed contributions for United Nations peacekeeping operations. He stressed the need for root causes of conflict to be addressed, including through climate change mitigation, security sector reform and strengthening the rule of law for effective institutions. As well, regulating the exploitation of natural resources pose security and economic growth challenges, and must be integrated into the mandates of peace operations. Turning to justice, he underscored the need to fight against impunity. Turning to the fight against terrorism, he said it raises the question: \"Where does United Nations action stop?\" The question pertains to geographic limits, and the life cycle of peace operations in a transitional context, he said, emphasizing the need for continuity to be ensured between operations and actors, including through the Peacebuilding Fund.\n\nJOO GENSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO ( Brazil ), stressing that peace and development are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, said that economic growth and development are necessary to give people hope and to help reduce the appeal of violent ideologues. Strengthening international cooperation, investing in productive capacities and combating poverty and hunger are as essential to addressing conflict as security considerations, he said. Building resilience in vulnerable countries is necessary; however, achieving this goal must not be a burden placed solely on peace operations, he underscored. Pointing out that the peacebuilding role must be balanced with realistic and clear mandates, he cautioned that excessively ambitious, vague and open-ended mandates can result in frustration among partners and in the population in the host country. Noting that the Peacebuilding Commission is well suited to work as a platform to promote greater coordination among relevant partners, he added that focusing solely on the security dimension of conflicts will lead to endlessly renewing peacekeeping mandates.\n\nANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA ( Russian Federation ) stressed that without political solutions, it will be impossible to agree on clear and realistic mandates, gain the host countrys trust, or ensure effective support to regional efforts. Noting the expansion of peacekeeping mandates through various secondary and non-core tasks such as those related to human rights, social, gender and climate, she said peacekeeping operations, as a result, have become part of conflict management rather than a tool for its resolution. On addressing the growing threat of terrorism, she said the problem requires a military solution, which can be provided only through national efforts and, if need be, with bilateral or regional assistance. Moreover, all countries impacted in a region must be united in addressing the problem, despite any political differences. African States are justified in raising the issue of the provision of financial assistance by the United Nations in those efforts, she said, noting her delegations readiness to discuss the matter.\n\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB ( United Arab Emirates ) stressed that tailored, clear, and realistic transition strategies require extensive coordination with a variety of local actors, including women, youth, religious and community leaders. Noting that peace operations can lead to improved, lasting, and positive outcomes, including by building reliable infrastructure that can benefit host communities after the drawdown of peace operations, he said this is particularly relevant as unprecedented droughts, heat waves, floods and other extreme weather events continue to exponentially increase. He further stressed the importance of promoting a coordinated and integrated multilateral response, ensuring coordination with all actors, including the Council, the Peace Building Commission as well as regional and subregional organisations. The legacy of peace operations is \"not only what is accomplished when they are there, but what happens when they leave\", he concluded.\n\nJOONKOOK HWANG ( Republic of Korea ), addressing complex security challenges faced by peace operations, highlighted the need to build resilience through cooperation with local populations, while respecting their ownership and priorities. In this regard, he noted that Korean peacekeepers in South Sudan have been conducting civilian and military coordination activities within their mandates of protection and reconstruction, including vocational training in sectors such as agriculture, carpentry, electricity and construction. He underlined the need to strengthen the Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus to address the root causes of conflicts. Further, he highlighted the need for early engagement in peacebuilding, encouraging the Council to actively consult with the Peacebuilding Commission in drafting and adjusting mandates, and coming up with political guidelines. All such efforts require adequate, predictable, and sustained financing. As the host country of the 2021 Seoul Peacekeeping Ministerial, the Republic of Korea reaffirms its support for building and sustaining peace in all phases of the peace continuum.\n\nMAURIZIO MASSARI ( Italy ), aligning himself with the European Union, called on the international community to enforce and embrace the strategic transition of peacekeeping operations. Noting the multiple factors behind conflict, from extremism to food insecurity, he called for a shift from the traditional paradigm to implementation of coherent strategies endorsed in A4P. Stressing the importance of clear and achievable mandates and close cooperation with the host country, he also highlighted the need for full participation of women at all stages of the peace process. While peacekeeping cannot address all factors leading to a conflict, it can pave the way for long-standing peace and must be designed to achieve conducive conditions, he said. Further, peacekeeping and peacebuilding must be considered complementary, he said, adding that peace processes do not end when the last soldier leaves. The Council must make use of rule of law missions, special political missions and regionally based envoys, he said.\n\nOSAMA MAHMOUD ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD ( Egypt ) said the Council must pay greater attention to the peacebuilding component of its activities, considering the context and the needs expressed. The Councils approach to peacebuilding must be holistic and consider regional and cross-border dimensions, support local capacities and provide services to people in cross border areas. He called on the Council to benefit from the advisory role of the Peacebuilding Commission, which has vast and varied experience, including in addressing root causes of conflict. Given the nature of current challenges, the United Nations must deepen partnerships with regional and subregional organizations. The partnership between the United Nations and African Union is central to tackling challenges, including combatting terrorism. Urging sufficient, predictable and lasting financing to support countries in post-conflict situations, he called on Member States to allow peacebuilding efforts to benefit from assessed contributions in the regular budget of the United Nations.\n\nBOTJAN MALOVRH ( Slovenia ), aligning himself with the European Union, stated that an innovative and more integrated approach to peace operations is needed to effectively address root causes of conflict and build resilient societies at a very early stage of peacebuilding. Noting that cooperation and partnership, with support to regional, national and local efforts and ensuring national ownership, are essential in building trust and resilience, he said such efforts should also include capacity-building, promoting and protecting human rights and access to health services and education, socioeconomic development as well as establishing early warning and early response mechanisms. Stressing that women and youth as agents of change have an essential role in the pursuit of lasting peace and resilient societies, he emphasized that lenses of women, peace and security as well as youth, peace and security should be applied when supporting regional, national and local efforts.\n\nPASCALE BAERISWYL ( Switzerland ) stated that, while peacekeeping missions can encourage violence prevention that addresses root causes, the affected population, in particular women, must be able to engage in a substantive and relevant dialogue with local authorities on good governance, human rights, the rule of law and climate change. Placing importance on coherent action by the United Nations system, she stressed that close cooperation between the Resident Coordinator's office and mission leadership is its key aspect, as is coordination with various donors and international financial institutions such as the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund. Underscoring that the local population must be committed to the objectives of peacekeeping missions with equal and significant participation of women, she pointed out that good strategic communication, as well as an effective response to the expectations of the civilian population, are the basis for this acceptance.\n\nSURIYA CHINDAWONGSE ( Thailand ) stressed the need for concerns of affected countries to be foregrounded in achieving sustainable peace and stability in any conflict-affected area. To this end, Thailand supports inclusive consultations between the Security Council, the host country, troop- and police- contributing countries, among other stakeholders. He stressed the need for regional-global partnerships, integrating the perspectives of affected countries, and support from the international community in providing best practices and mobilizing resources. He commended the leadership of the African Union and subregional organizations in addressing peace and security challenges on the continent, as well as the UN-AU Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security. Further, he underscored the importance of mutually-reinforcing sustainable peace and sustainable development through capacity building support, outlining efforts by Thai peacekeepers in this regard, including through capacity-building help to build infrastructure in South Sudan. Further, inclusiveness is integral to addressing the root causes of conflict and achieving sustaining peace.\n\nALEXANDER MARSCHIK ( Austria ), stressing that it is not enough to build peace in the strictest sense of the word, added that the international community must build resilience in conflict and post-conflict settings. Underscoring the importance of system-wide coherence on a global level, he said the Security Council must address underlying factors of conflict by fostering links with other parts of the Organization, particularly the Peacebuilding Commission. The peace and security system should also draw on the vast expertise of the United Nations system for early warning and prevention. The Organization must foster even stronger partnerships with regional organizations such as the African Union, ECOWAS and European Union, he said, highlighting the fundamental role of women and young people in conflict prevention, peace processes and strengthening resilience.\n\nVANESSA FRAZIER ( Malta ) stated that peacekeeping mandates need to include a clear vision of how a mission will empower local societies and create resilient communities and institutions. Touching on the women, peace and security agenda, she noted that by ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of females, the international community can contribute to the formation of resilient institutions and an inclusive society. Youth also have a fundamental role to play, she added. Stressing that the United Nations system has the necessary institutional knowledge and experience to refine its vision of how peacekeeping operations can bridge existing gaps and establish sustainable peace, she pressed the Council to maximize its potential and contemplate how to deploy future missions.\n\nANDRS EFREN MONTALVO SOSA ( Ecuador ) said that to prevent or stop war, dialogue is indispensable; once it is established, it is necessary to continue strengthening rule of law, promoting economic growth, eradicating poverty, reducing inequalities and growing democracy. All that must take place within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In post-conflict contexts, sustainable peace must be based on a reconciliation process achieved through transitional justice and reparations to victims, as well as the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants. In line with the outcome of the 2020 review of the peacebuilding architecture, the Council must provide United Nations peace missions with necessary tools to continue strengthening long-term actions. He underscored the need to strengthen synergies of peace operations as early as possible through integrated and coordinated planning of transitions, with Resident Coordinators, United Nations country teams, other funds and programmes of the United Nations, the host country and other national actors.\n\nANNA KARIN ENESTRM ( Sweden ), also speaking on behalf of Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway, stressed that peace operations cannot replace the need for political will of conflict parties to pursue peace, encouraging greater integration of police and law enforcement perspectives into missions. Noting that regional organizations such as the European Union and African Union should be actively engaged in political processes and security efforts, she encouraged cohesion with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as initiatives such as the Accra Initiative, in line with A4P commitments.\n\nHighlighting that Nordic countries are among key contributors to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, jointly responsible for over 30 per cent of its funding, she stressed the importance of sufficient financing to support peacebuilding activities throughout their lifecycles and in their transition phases. Recalling that climate change and climate-related security risks must be an integral part of peace operations, she encouraged more countries to support the United Nations Climate Security Mechanism, which has sent advisors to missions.\n\nRBERT CHATRNCH ( Slovakia ) said that sustaining peace in Africa is a challenge that needs to be addressed in a holistic way. Security sector reform is one of the key elements for effective conflict prevention and successful post-conflict rebuilding and stabilization. A nationally-led and inclusive security sector reform process can progressively deal with the root causes of insecurity and fragility and create an enabling environment for sustainable development and peace to take place. Slovakia also recognizes the importance of the women, peace and security agenda in contributing to peace operations that create conditions for stability. It has also been proven that when young people are meaningfully engaged in peace processes the outcomes are usually more lasting and sustainable. Supporting youth advocates is about building capacity, fostering partnerships and fully integrating their perspective across the full spectrum of work.\n\nYOKA BRANDT ( Netherlands ), aligning herself with the statement to be delivered by the European Union, said that peace operations should have strategic political mandates that contain long-term objectives to enhance resilience and reach sustainable peace. In this regard, she pointed to the need for a transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding to be incorporated into mandates from the start of the operation. Noting that adequate, predictable and sustainable funding of the Peacebuilding Fund is important in ensuring effective and efficient peacebuilding work and preventing future conflicts, she also welcomed the Funds efforts to integrate mental health and psychosocial support in its peacebuilding interventions. Pointing out the value of coordinating efforts with regional organizations such as the African Union and international financial institutions such as the World Bank, she suggested that periodic, focused and action-oriented consultations between these players should be enhanced.\n\nISHIKANE KIMIHIRO ( Japan ) stressed the importance of strengthening United Nations peace operations, including through coordinating and integrating its efforts to support nationally-led peacebuilding activities, and those carried out by a range of partners, including United Nations agencies, regional organizations and civil society organizations, among others. Moreover, the Council should regularly draw upon the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission, so that the activities of peace operations can integrate a longer-term perspective required for peacebuilding and sustaining peace, consistent with each missions specific situation on the ground. Turning to sustainable funding for resilience-building against security threats including in the Sahel and coastal West Africa, he underlined the need to further leverage the Peacebuilding Fund, as well as the Peacebuilding Commission, to promote more effective and sustainable use of resources. The Peacebuilding Commission should bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources where the need for addressing threats is identified, while the Fund should strengthen its primary function as a \"seed fund\" to mobilize other bilateral and multilateral financial resources.\n\nSILVIO GONZATO, representative of the European Union , in its capacity as observer, stated that building resilient peace means looking beyond peace agreements and continuously working on the underlying roots of conflict such as climate change, food insecurity, inequality and fragile governance. Working across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus is also essential towards ensuring a coherent strategy in supporting breaking the vicious cycles of conflict. The women, peace and security and the youth, peace and security agendas are mainstreamed across the joint priorities of the Union and United Nations, he said. His bloc also supports many United Nations bodies that focus on various aspects of peacebuilding and sustaining peace. Noting that there is clearly a need for a strengthened and more coherent approach to peace and security, he said that sustainable funding is a key part of the puzzle. The bloc is among the biggest contributors to the Peacebuilding Fund, providing more than 60 per cent of the funding to the mechanism, he added.\n\nPAULA NARVEZ OJEDA ( Chile ), noting the difficult situations faced by peace operations, said an integral and multidimensional focus on conflicts was needed, which will address their structural causes. Similarly, priority attention must be given to existing vulnerabilities, which deepen the consequences of inequalities, poverty, loss of ecosystems, scarcity of resources, spread of diseases and forced displacements. Peacekeeping operations tend to be deployed in areas highly damaged by climate change, she pointed out. Thus, to conduct successful peace operations, coordination among the three pillars of the United Nations system is essential, especially as it relates to harmonizing the objectives of international peace and security with the purposes of the Sustainable Development Goals and human rights. Moreover, peace operations should seek to foster stable, more just and inclusive societies, based on the rule of law, human rights, and the empowerment of youth and women, among others. Within the Chilean contingent deployed as military experts on missions, 28 per cent are women, she said, noting that her country aims to reach 57 per cent by December.\n\nTAREK LADEB ( Tunisia ) stressed that despite the active engagement of the Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, sustainable peace remains beyond reach in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa. While some Council members may argue that some underlying drivers of instability and conflicts are not within its mandate, he added, such structural factors could contribute to the resurgence of conflicts during or after peace operations and might even have a spillover effect that amplifies insecurity at the regional level given their cross-boundary nature. In this regard, he pressed the Council to reflect more on how to adjust peace operations to deal with such fragile contexts, through better coordinated and tailor-made mandates. He further pointed to the need to strengthen relationships with other United Nations organs, regional organizations, especially the African Union, and international financial institutions.\n\nXOLISA MFUNDISO MABHONGO ( South Africa ) stressed that in light of the volatile and dangerous environments in which peacekeeping missions operate, the international community must continuously strengthen the quality of resilience and their adaptation to the wider architecture of peacekeeping. Recalling that his country had hosted the sixth Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping International Symposium, he underscored that transformative and innovative strategies must be adopted as part of resilience building in peace operations. He further pointed to the need to ensure higher levels of womens participation in peacekeeping operations by preparing appropriate facilities and training programmes for them. Underscoring that the United Nations system should strengthen partnerships with other organizations, he reiterated that the United Nations should contribute to the financing of the African-Union-led peace operations authorized by the Council.\n\nNACIM GAOUAOUI ( Algeria ), welcoming the timely and important subject of the debate for the African continent, where conflicts are manifold, underscored the function of peace operations in creating an environment conducive for peacebuilding, development and conflictprevention. Even before the issuing of mandates, peacekeeping missions should have the resources to implement their responsibilities, he said, adding that such operations must ensure no vacuum is left behind, in the case of their exit and drawdown. Such operations require political will and a comprehensive strategy, ensuring active, inclusive participation at all levels. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts are critically important during and after conflicts, to restore stability. As well, it is important to build national military capacity to address terrorist threats and the proliferation of arms. Further, he underlined the need to address asymmetric threats to civilians and peacekeepers through early warning systems and enhancing State capacity in the realm of counter-terrorism.\n\nLUIS FELIPE LLOSA ( Peru ) said that, to ensure resilience in areas previously affected by conflict, it is essential to build relationships of trust between peacekeeping mission staff and the main local actors, such as national authorities, the private and productive sector, and local and popular movements, such as those led by women and youth. Such approaches should correspond to the process of transition from conflict to peacebuilding. They should also be considered in mission mandates, considering respect for human rights, promotion of gender equality, strengthening of the rule of law, eradication of poverty and building resilient and robust institutions that allow for the consolidation of peaceful coexistence. His country has been contributing decisively to six operations aimed at consolidating peace in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Abyei and Lebanon a growing demonstration of its commitment to multilateralism and collective security, he said.\n\nSERHII DVORNYK ( Ukraine ), aligning himself with the European Union, stated that along with new challenges such as the COVID19 pandemic and climate change, the international community is still compelled to confront the threats of an inter-State conflict resulting from an armed aggression and full-fledged invasion. He added that the underlying causes of insecurity across the globe, particularly in Africa, could hardly be remedied without proper and sufficient response to the aggressive behaviour of the Russian Federation. Pointing out that civilians and their rights are among the first to be hit by any war, he underscored that it should be a top priority for any peacekeeping operation to fully implement their mandate on ensuring civilians security and safety. \"Now more than ever, we need a strong Security Council where all members are legitimate, responsible, as well as reliable contributors to safeguarding the rules- and values-based international order,\" he concluded.\n\nRICHARD ARBEITER ( Canada ) stated that certain ingredients, such as genuine engagement of the parties to the conflict in a peace process, and clear and achievable mandates with the necessary resources, are absent despite being key to the success of peace operations. The peacekeeping partnership extends beyond the Security Council and the success of the mission depends on the collaboration of all actors and mutual accountability. Further, the strength of the Peacebuilding Commission is that everything is done at the request and with the consent of the countries and regions. \"The PBC [Peacebuilding Commission] speaks with countries, not just about them,\" he emphasized. There is deep value in the advice that the Commission can offer to the Council. Finally, on funding mechanisms available to support resilience building, the call for Member States to increase their contributions to peacebuilding and peacekeeping is important. In December 2021, Canada proudly announced a commitment of $70 million over three years to the Peacebuilding Fund to help close the funding gap and support gender-focused interventions.\n\nMUHAMMAD ABDUL MUHITH ( Bangladesh ) said that military operations alone will not help bring about sustainable peace, in light of the evolving challenges and threats facing the global security environment. Capacity-building of relevant host country institutions is vital to build resilient institutions when peace operations leave countries. As a leading troop- and police-contributing country, Bangladesh has been involved in many resilience-building efforts in host countries, including conflict-prevention, monitoring truces, supporting elections, strengthening judicial reform, and constructing roads and schools. He underlined the need for operations to help foster inclusive participation, in line with Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 2250 (2015). As well, there is a need for more effective partnership and coordination between United Nations funds and agencies as well as regional organizations, in line with Council resolution 2594 (2021). He called for sustained financing for operations and for greater synergy to be fostered between peacebuilding and peacekeeping, with the help of the Peacebuilding Commission, particularly with respect to mandate-setting.\n\nKRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI ( Poland ) noted that there can be no long-term stability without eliminating the underlying causes of conflicts such as the lack of socio-political unity, exclusion from political processes, inequalities, weak institutions, climate-related risks and food insecurity. Pointing to the importance of focusing on the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, he stressed the need to overcome the silo mentality and apply a more comprehensive approach, cross-cutting through the areas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Highlighting that partnerships are another important ingredient of sustainable peace, he endorsed closer cooperation between the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, including international financial institutions. In this regard, he expressed support for the Peacebuilding Commissions collaboration with various United Nations organs and bodies, including the Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and missions in the field.\n\nOMAR KADIRI ( Morocco ) said the response to multiple and complex challenges should be based on new approaches and innovation that will allow the international community to anticipate and intervene, rather than be limited to responding. He voiced support for the work of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, particularly in local capacity-building for women and young people in mediation and conflict prevention, noting that his country is honoured to be among the Departments donor countries for several years to date. He stressed the need to strengthen complementarity and coordination between the Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. The Central African Republic Configuration, chaired by his country, is continuing the excellent practice of sharing information with the Council based on peacebuilding priorities before each renewal of the mandate of MINUSCA, he said.\n\nALHAJI FANDAY TURAY ( Sierra Leone ) stressed that successful outcomes for peace depend on valuing prevention more and focusing on peacebuilding at the local and national levels. A key factor in building sustainable peace is local ownership, he said, which is often inadequately attended to or even undermined by international humanitarian action, development assistance, disaster recovery, and peacebuilding efforts. Working closely with local actors, peacebuilders truly understand the conflict perspective and context-specific characteristics of a given region, as well as the peoples strengths, assets and strategies in the face of violence. A resilience approach offers a crucial tool to analyse and design policies and programming, which will be tailored to the specific needs of the local people. \"Together we are stronger, and it is much easier to sustain peace with all the stakeholders on board than with some excluded and marginalized,\" the representative said.\n\nCLAVER GATETE ( Rwanda ) stressed the need for an awareness strategy to educate communities on their role in restoring peace and rebuilding the country to create ownership. Expectations should also be well articulated to avoid false hopes, he said, adding that tentative peace operations should support and mobilize host-nation authorities in addressing issues compromising their security and stability. Host countries should also develop and implement what is best for them, understanding the importance of including all stakeholders and ensuring that relevant needs, including those of the most vulnerable, are addressed. After the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda, homegrown solutions were embedded within the reform framework. Rwanda was then able to establish institutional reforms with the support of partners, but the \"what and how\" was left for Rwandans, so they could be accountable for their decisions. \"This way, our failures are our own\", he concluded.\n\nMARTN JUAN MAINERO ( Argentina ) stated that the Council has recently confronted both traditional and non-traditional threats, requiring the organ to design new approaches to guarantee an effective response that will ensure sustainable peace. Noting that new threats to peace and international security include advanced weapons and cybercrimes, he stressed the need to give robust mandates to peacekeeping operations, enabling them to respond to the changing security dynamic and adapt to the contemporary times context.\n\nMARISKA DWIANTI DHANUTIRTO ( Indonesia ) stressed that the Security Council should be agile in deciding on what form the mission takes throughout the peace continuum. Further, she underscored the need for national ownership in order to respond to conditions on the ground. Peace operations must ensure a positive impact on local populations, not only in facilitating national stakeholders for dialogue, but in addressing the root causes of conflicts. In this regard, she called for the role of women peacekeepers to be optimized to better enhance peacekeeping operations and reach vulnerable groups more effectively. Further, training and capacity-building should be strengthened to ensure peacekeepers can competently address their mandate. To this end, she underscored the need to foster partnerships in achieving specific tasks, including a better understanding of local culture, adding that her country incorporates community engagement in its pre-deployment training.\n\nJEANNE MRAD ( Lebanon ) stressed that countries facing stark inequality and weak institutions are at increased risk of conflict. Poorly distributed wealth and lack of jobs, opportunities and freedoms, particularly for a large youth population, can also increase the risk of instability. As such, sustainable peace requires a comprehensive approach to security. Development and security can no longer be addressed in silos, she said. As root causes of conflicts, peace and security are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. The Council might be required to devise new approaches to ensure a balanced response to both military operations and underlying causes of conflict. Her delegation favors United Nations country teams working as parallel yet complementary structures with peacekeeping operations. This will allow the creation in tandem of an enabling environment for peacebuilding and sustaining peace in close coordination with local communities and Governments.\n\nANA PAULA BAPTISTA GRADE ZACARIAS ( Portugal ), aligning herself with the European Union, stated that as her country is currently engaged in several missions, including in the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Colombia, she has become aware that peacekeeping is now increasingly demanding with more complex and hostile operational environments. Stressing the need to focus on the root causes of conflicts, she underscored that political engagement at all levels is necessary to address grievances and to rebuild trust between citizens and the State, military and law enforcement. She shared that her country has supported Mozambique in tackling the armed conflict in Cabo Delgado, providing training to its armed forces as well as support towards its justice, security and defence sectors. Noting that the A4P Plus initiative recognizes the key role of regional organizations in ensuring local ownership, she expressed hope that a decision will be made soon to ensure predictable and sustainable financing for African Union-led operations.\n\nTIJJANI MUHAMMAD BANDE ( Nigeria ) said the Council must develop new strategies to deliver sustainable peace, pointing out that in the Sahel, communities affected by terrorism and violent extremism require greater access to livelihoods, social protection, and basic social services to build resilience and reduce vulnerabilities to radicalization and recruitment. Noting that most peace operations take place in countries most exposed to climate change, he underscored the need for the Council to identify partnerships and strategies to address climate-related security risks. Further, peacekeepers can play a vital role in supporting national responses to health crises, and provide support in the delivery and funding of vocational and skills trainings for local communities. Underscoring the need for predictable and sustainable funding to build resilience against security threats in the Sahel and coastal west Africa, he welcomed progress made by the United Nations in securing increased funding for peacebuilding, including through assessed contributions, and emphasized the need for such efforts to support peacekeeping operations undertaken by the African Union and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nAL-HARITH IDRISS AL-HARITH MOHAMED ( Sudan ), drawing on his countrys experience, noted that peacebuilding efforts should be implemented by focusing on the principles of resilience and national or local ownership as well as sustaining peace. It should endeavour to achieve peace by linking the international peacebuilding process to local political, cultural and social actors, he added. He expressed hope that the peacebuilding process will boost the mobilization of necessary resources and support for national efforts aimed at establishing the necessary mechanism for drafting its constitution. He called on United Nations country teams and other organizations, including international financial institutions, to provide the necessary support for the countrys transition and peacebuilding.",

                "cc_text": "Transcript of the Interview\n\nLuisa Leme: Ambassador Thomas Shannon. Thank you so much for being on Latin America in Focus with us today. It's an honor to have you.\n\nAmbassador Thomas Shannon: No, thank you very much. It's a real pleasure.\n\nLeme: Ambassador, let's jump right into it. When Lula was president the first time, we saw Brazil taking a kind of leading diplomatic role in Latin America. How would you compare that period of Brazil's foreign policy potential with Lula coming in now? What does Lula's win mean for Latin American relations?\n\nShannon: Great question. But let me start with a short comment on what it means for Brazil because at the end of the day, the important thing about elections is that people get to express their point of view. Obviously the Brazilian people have chosen a new president, but what's important here is that Brazilian democracy functioned, that the institutions showed not just their rootedness, but their resilience, and that at the end of the day, even President Jair Bolsonaro has acknowledged that he lost this election.\n\nAnd this is a powerful moment for Brazilian democracy. And it's a powerful moment in the hemisphere, and I think globally because it shows that democracy works and that you can do peaceful transfers of power. This is important. It's also important for the United States as we face something similar. But broadly speaking about what it means for Latin American diplomacy and Brazil's role in the worldthe world is very different than during the period of time that President Lula was in office.\n\nBut that said, I think what Lula's victory means is that Brazil is returning to a global role that it had begun to assume for itself during the presidency of President Lula, in which it emerged not only as a large economy, but as a country dedicated to peaceful resolution of disputes, dedicated to multilateral organizations, and looking for ways to advanced Brazil's interests within the structures that Brazil had played a role in building in the aftermath of World War II. And so in this sense, Brazil's presence is going to strengthen the multilateral structures of our hemisphere, the intra-American system, but it will also strengthen the UN structures, and I think it will be a positive and important influence in trying to resolve some of the larger transnational global issues that we face, including climate change.\n\nLeme: I have heard some news that Lula's first international trip should be for COP27, which is going to happen in Egypt.\n\nWhat about, let's say, bilateral relations? What does Lula's victory mean for Latin America's ties with the United States?\n\nShannon: The Biden administration has just held the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, which is the first time an American president has participated in the summit in eight years. And that was important. President Trump never participated in the summit. And this is important because it means United States is back in the summit process, and it's engaging broadly in the hemisphere. And this was the first time that many of the newly elected leaders of the hemisphere had an opportunity to gather and meet. So this is a new bunch of leadership, an important group of leaders, and we're going to have to use what was begun in Los Angeles and expand that outward.\n\nAnd because of President Lula's prestige, but also because of the recognition that he is an elder statesman now, if you want us to call him that, someone who is recognized not only as a politician of great quality, but as someone with a lot of regional and global experience, much more than any of the newly elected leaders in the hemisphere. And so I think he's going to bring that wisdom to bear in the hemisphere and beyond.\n\nLeme: For many, as you were saying, Lula is seen as an icon among world leaders. I remember Obama calling him \"the man,\" and we have leaders from all over the globe congratulating him. And even leaders of multilateral organizations or organizations like PAHO, for example, congratulating him on Twitter.\n\nThe world is in the middle of being in a divisive time, between the Ukraine conflict and economic worries. What do you see as opportunities or hurdles for leadership in this global context?\n\nShannon: As the world addresses the consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some of them are very evident, especially in regards to food security and energy security, and looking for ways to ensure that as we and others try to find a solution to Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, and look for a way to negotiate a peace, that we can ensure that people aren't starving because of this war.\n\nBrazil and the United States are the two largest food producers in the world, and the two largest food exporters in the world. And my own view is that there's a lot more we can and should be doing together to address problems of food security. I also think that there's more we can be doing both bilaterally, but also in our hemisphere, to ensure that the Americas are playing an important role in addressing problems of energy security. Russia supplies up to one third of the world's oil, and that's significant.\n\nAs we look for ways to ensure that that energy and food don't drive inflation, I think Brazil and the United States can play a very important role.",

All times EDT.\n\n11:30 p.m.: Ukraine's Home-Front Helpers: Throughout the Russian invasion, Ukrainian civilians have been volunteering and working to make vital hardware for their countrys war effort. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has the photos.\n\n9:28 p.m.: In the first half of 2022, 419,000 Russians left the country, according to the Rosstat statistics agency. Although more recent figures have not been released, the exodus has likely grown since President Vladimir Putin announced a military mobilization on September 21. While it is unclear how many of those departures were Russians leaving the country for the long term, the loss of working-age people, entrepreneurs, and trained specialists has been a significant drain for Russia.\n\nAccording to the BCS Global Markets analytical firm, individual Russians sent $14 billion abroad in the first nine months of the year, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nIn addition, more than 1,000 international companies have stop working in Russia because of unprecedented Western sanctions levied against Moscow following the invasion. Some 320 have left Russia completely. Hundreds of Russian businesses have also sought greener pastures abroad.\n\n9:04 p.m.:\n\n8:06 p.m.: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, under fire for a Friday trip to Beijing with German CEOs, said his joint statement with Chinese President Xi Jinping opposing the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine had been reason enough for the visit, Reuters reported.\n\n7:17 p.m.: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has held undisclosed talks with top Russian officials in hopes of reducing the risk the war in Ukraine spills over or escalates into a nuclear conflict, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the newspaper cited U.S. and allied officials as saying that Sullivan, President Joe Biden's top aide on national security, held confidential conversations in recent months with Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan's counterpart, that were not disclosed publicly.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the report, responding to questions about the story only with a statement attributed to National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson: \"People claim a lot of things.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said the officials did not provide the dates or the number of calls.\n\n6:38 p.m.:\n\n5:57 p.m.: Relatives welcomed released servicemen after they returned to the Russian-held Donetsk region on Sunday, following a recent prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nDaria Morozova, a Russia-installed ombudswoman for human rights, said 19 servicemen from the area, who fought for Russia, were released and returned to the city.\n\nMorozova added that four of the 19 have remained in the hospital.\n\nAfter a medical examination and treatment, all soldiers will be sent to Russia for rehabilitation, said Morozova.\n\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, \"107 Russian military personnel who were in deadly danger in captivity were returned\" from the Kyiv-controlled territory on Thursday.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed acting regional head, earlier said on Telegram that each side would return 107 members of military personnel, with 65 of those released by Ukraine hailing from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Russia is suffering heavy losses in continuing \"fierce\" attacks in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and is preparing new assaults on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Very fierce Russian attacks on Donetsk region are continuing. The enemy is suffering serious losses there,\" Zelenskiyy said in his nightly video address.\n\nZelenskiyy said he believed Russia was \"concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of mass attacks on our infrastructure, energy in the first instance.\"\n\n4:09 p.m.:\n\n3:20 p.m.: In his video address Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said anyone who helps Russia prolong the war should bear responsibility for the consequences of it. Zelenskyy referred to Irans complicity in Russias invasion on Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainian forces downed some Iranian attack drones again Sunday, but, he added, there were also hits.\n\n3 p.m.: The mayor of Kyiv, Ukraines capital, is warning residents that they must prepare for the worst this winter if Russia keeps targeting the countrys energy infrastructure. The Associated Press reports, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that having no electricity, water or heat in the freezing cold cannot be ruled out.\n\n\"We are doing everything to avoid this. But lets be frank, our enemies are doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die. And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations,\" Mayor Vitali Klitschko told state media.\n\n2:30 p.m.: A spokesman of the Ukraine army has accused Russia of destroying civilian vessels anchored on the banks of Dnipro River in Russian-controlled Kherson.

Some 40% of the country's energy infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, the Times reported.

More than 115,000 people were evacuated from that area, it reports.\n\n10:35 a.m.: The White House on November 12 hailed Russias withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson as an \"extraordinary victory\" for Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said \"It does look as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag - and that is quite a remarkable thing,\" RFE/RL reports.\n\n10:20 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met today with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh.\n\nState Department Spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken discussed with Kuleba the United States unwavering commitment to assist Ukraine in mitigating the effects of Russias continued attacks on critical infrastructure, including with accelerated humanitarian aid and winterization efforts.\n\nThe two reaffirmed the importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiatives renewal before it expires on November 19 and its role in supporting global food security.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraines continued effectiveness on the battlefield, with Blinken reiterating that the timing and substance of any negotiation framework remains Ukraines decision.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Russian forces retreating from Kherson city and surrounding areas have stolen around 15,000 paintings, including historic icons and other religious art, from the region, Ukraine's National Resistance Center reports.\n\nThe center said that the Russian soldiers had robbed the Oleksiy Shovkunenko Kherson Art Museum among others. The museums collection includes religious paintings of the 17th and early 20th centuries, Ukrainian art from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and works of contemporary artists.\n\nAccording to the Center, four trucks with the stolen art arrived in Simferopol, a city in Russia-occupied Crimea.\n\n9:45 am.: Renowned graffiti artist Banksy has unveiled his latest work, this time in the Ukrainian town of Borodyanka, fueling speculation that the anonymous artist was working in the war-torn country, the BBC reports.\n\nBorodyanka, was one of the towns hardest hit by Russias shelling in the early days of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,\n\nBanksy posted a photo of the mural - a girl gymnast performing a handstand on a small pile of concrete rubble - on Instagram late on Friday. The work is painted onto the wall of a destroyed building.\n\nAnother piece of new graffiti in Banksy's signature style was spotted in Borodyanka, portraying a man resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin being flipped in judo by a small child.\n\nThe symbolism is an apparent allusion to the biblical story of David and Goliath, the unlikely triumph of the underdog, and can be viewed as a subtle nod to Putin's much-publicized love of the Japanese martial art.\n\nUkraine's Defense Department tweeted a photo of it.\n\n9:35 a.m.: Russia said on Saturday there was no agreement yet to extend the Black Sea initiative, a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain from Black Sea ports.\n\nRussia repeated its insistence on unhindered access to world markets for its own food and fertilizer exports, which even though they are not directly targeted by Western sanctions, are blocked because the sanctions cut shippers' access to finance, insurance and ports, Reuters reports.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying talks with U.N. officials in Geneva on Friday had been useful and detailed but the issue of renewing the deal - which expires in one week - had yet to be resolved.\n\nHe also said there could be no progress unless a Russian state bank that finances the farm sector was reconnected to the international SWIFT bank payments system, from which it has been cut off by Western sanctions.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is pressing Southeast Asian countries for political and material support in his countys fight against Russia.\n\nThe Associated Press reports, Kuleba accused Moscow of playing \"hunger games\" with the world by blocking shipments of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products from being exported to global markets.\n\nKuleba told reporters Saturday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit that the world needs to pressure Russia not to object to the extension of a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain and fertilizer, which is due to expire November 19.\n\nMore than just calling for the deal to continue, however, Kuleba accused Russian inspectors of \"quiet sabotage,\" by intentionally dragging their feet in allowing shipments through.\n\n9:15 a.m.: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit (ASEAN) Saturday.

The withdrawal is a public recognition of the difficulties faced by Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nIt is likely that Ukraine has retaken large areas of Kherson oblast on the west bank of the Dnipro River, the update said, and that its forces are now largely in control of Kherson city itself.\n\n2:11 a.m.: Once purely the stuff of action movie plots, the prospect of the lights going out in Europe's biggest economy has become a conceivable threat during the current energy crisis, Reuters reported.\n\nLooking to be the heroes in a real-life blackout, a growing number of Germans are turning to citizens' courses to learn how to act if they find themselves plunged into darkness.\n\n\"If the electricity goes out then absolutely nothing works any more. And we need to understand what 'nothing working' really means,\" said Birgitt Eberlin, an instructor at the Workers' Samaritan Federation (ASB).\n\n1:09 a.m.: The White House on Saturday hailed what it said appeared to be an \"extraordinary victory\" for Ukraine in recapturing the city of Kherson from Russian occupiers, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"It does look as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag -- and that is quite a remarkable thing,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on the way to the ASEAN summit in Cambodia.\n\n12:02 a.m.:",

Until we hear that peace has finally been restored,\" Zelensky said in a recorded address, receiving the US Liberty Medal.\n\n4:40pm: Zelensky says Black Sea grain export deal must be extended\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday that the UN-brokered Black Sea grain export deal that unblocked three major Ukrainian ports must be extended.\n\n\"It is necessary for the grain agreement to continue in the future.

A Russian diplomat on Tuesday cited Moscows dissatisfaction with its implementation.\n\nSpeaking to farmers and reporters at a grain storage facility in Kyiv.

The Council is a multilateral and democratic body governed by clear rules agreed upon by Member States, who cannot \"cherry-pick\" the mandates they like and attack those they do not agree with, he said.\n\nCalling on the international community to support the Councils work to promote and protect human rights globally, he highlighted the responsibility of the Fifth Committee to allocate it with adequate resources. Pointing to 100 per cent participation among States in the Universal Periodic Review, he said this provides an agreed roadmap for development.\n\nTurning to civil society and the Councils need to remain inclusive, he said the body heard 2,400 interventions from non-governmental organizations and participated in 72 events. He noted that the voluntary trust fund has allowed 26 delegates from small island developing and least developed countries to travel to the Council. On items the Council addressed, he said these ranged from country-specific human rights situations to emerging challenges like technologies in the military sector and cyberbullying.\n\nIn the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of China warning against intensified politicization of the Council, praised the bodys rejection of the Xinjiang decision as \"a collective victory of all developing countries\". In a similar vein, the representative of Ethiopia opposed the instrumentalization of human rights issues, emphasizing that country-specific mandates are counterproductive. The representative of Australia stressed the importance of promoting the rights of indigenous peoples, investigating human rights violations in any country and enhancing accountability.\n\nDuring the following general debate on the Human Rights Council, several delegates, including from Cuba and Syria, stressed that promotion and protection of human rights must take place in line with the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. Raising concerns over country-specific initiatives, the representative of India favored the Universal Periodic Review, rather than naming and shaming in a country-specific mandate. Also today, the Committee concluded its general debate on refugees, returnees and displaced persons. The representative of Ukraine noted that one of the largest crises of displacement in the world is ongoing in the heart of Europe, stemming from the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine. Adding that 14 million Ukrainians, or one third of the population, mostly women and children, have been uprooted by the war, she said that \"Russia has demonstrated its readiness to play hunger games and put millions of people across Asia, Africa and the Middle East at the risk of famine simply to achieve its imperialist goals\".\n\nThe representative of Georgia, noting that her country is supporting said more than 28,000 war-affected Ukrainians, also observed that \"multiple waves of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Russian Federation in Georgias Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia regions\" since 1991 have resulted in half a million Georgians being expelled from their homes. Moreover, these internally displaced persons and refugees are still deprived of the right to return to their homes, she said.\n\nIn rebuttal, the representative of the Russian Federation said 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees have fled and found protection in his country due to Kyivs civil war, coming voluntarily with their children. Rejecting claims that Moscow is playing hunger games, he said his State is participating in the Black Sea agreements, though only 3 per cent of that food from Ukraine is promised to developing countries.\n\nAlso speaking in the general debate on the Human Rights Council were representatives of South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Ecuador, Angola, Spain, Morocco, Costa Rica, Greece, Cameroon, Iran, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Eritrea, Japan and Myanmar.\n\nAddressing the general debate on the UNHCR were representatives of Algeria, Nigeria, United States, Myanmar, Azerbaijan, Greece, Mozambique, Cte dIvoire, India, Angola, Syria, Eritrea, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Australia, Trkiye, Albania, Montenegro, Japan, Uganda, Serbia and Morocco. A representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also spoke.\n\nThe Third Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday, 4 November, to begin action on proposed resolutions.\n\nGeneral Debate Statements\n\nAHMED SAHRAOUI ( Algeria ) pointed to a sharp rise in refugees due to global conflict and climate change, noting that donors are providing resources along political lines rather than through solidarity and shared responsibility. He added that multilateral work must be done with a security and developmental perspective, or refugees will be trapped in a vicious cycle. Algeria has hosted Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps for almost 45 years, he said, stressing that they are waiting for the international community to allow a return to their homeland. Assuring the Committee that the country will continue to support them, he also called for States to share the burden, requesting that the Resident Coordinator provide more assistance while refugees face increased food prices. He suggested that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) review assistance, following the World Food Programmes (WFP) approach.\n\nMs. UKAEJE ( Nigeria ) said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees collaborates with Member States to provide aid to refugees and ensure adequate responses to challenges they face. Existing tripartite agreements with Cameroon and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) facilitate the return of refugees to Cameroon. Nigeria has created a development peace nexus to advance solutions, focusing on emergencies, management of migration, bridging humanitarian responses with long-term development, and peace and security. The Government is implementing several housing projects with over 360 houses, a marketplace and a police station for persons who have been displaced due to the conflict in the northeast of Nigeria. An inclusive approach provides a crucial foundation for access to basic social services such as health care and education. Nigeria has put in place institutional and legal frameworks to eradicate statelessness by December 2024.\n\nNATALIIA MUDRENKO ( Ukraine ) said that one of the largest and most rapid crises of displacement in the world is ongoing in the heart of Europe, stemming from the Russia Federations full-scale unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. \"After eight months of terror and horror, Russias war uprooted some 14 million Ukrainians, or one-third of the population, mostly women and children\", she said, stressing that about 6.2 million citizens have been displaced within Ukraine and more than 7.5 million have sought safety abroad. Noting the consequences of the Russian Federations aggression globally, she said that \"Russia has demonstrated its readiness to play hunger games and put millions of people across Asia, Africa and the Middle East at the risk of famine simply to achieve its imperialist goals\". Refugees are unlikely to return to Ukraine quickly, she said, adding that the refugee crisis in Europe could become protracted, leading to more permanent displacement. Emphasizing that the Russian Federation attacks critical civilian infrastructure in her country, she said that, with winter approaching, these actions may threaten the survival of millions of people and induce further migration.\n\nExpressing concern for 1.6 million Ukrainians who have been forcibly transferred or deported by Russian Federation, she said they were forced to pass filtration and then displaced without any means of livelihood. Further, thousands of Ukrainian children have been illegally transferred to Russian Federation for adoption and indoctrination. These people are not refugees, but victims of deportation or forcible transfer, she emphasized. She urged the Russian Federation to provide the UNHCR and other humanitarian and human rights organizations access to Ukrainians within its territory to facilitate their safe return to Ukraine or other States. She lauded the humanitarian assistance and protection the UNHCR has given 2 million Ukrainians, the European Unions unprecedented decision to offer temporary social protection to them and the solidarity of its neighbours and other countries.\n\nSTEPHEN DOUGLAS BUNCH ( United States ), voicing concern about unprecedented levels of global displacement, reiterated his countrys commitment to support the forcibly displaced. He stressed that the United States is the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance, providing more than $17 billion in life-saving aid around the world this year. Moscows war in Ukraine worsens the global food security crisis that disproportionately harms the forcibly displaced, who often lack access to livelihoods and social protections. Internal conflicts and climate shocks, such as in the Horn of Africa, push people from their lands while preventing food assistance from reaching those who need it most. Without assistance, famine can decimate districts of Somalia where drought has displaced 926,00 people, he noted.\n\nKJAW MOE TUN ( Myanmar ) said that, after the military coup in his country in 2021, over 1 million people were displaced, with 52 million in need of humanitarian assistance. Internally displaced persons, especially women and girls, face food and hygiene crises and are at risk of human trafficking, he added. Acknowledging Bangladeshs hosting of Myanmars Rohingya refugee population, he said that the National Unity Government is committed to finding a solution, calling on the international community to continue providing them with health care and education. Recounting the militarys barbaric air strikes on civilians in the Sagaing region and on concertgoers in Kachin, he expressed deep concern that the number of displaced persons will only increase. Requesting that host countries such as Thailand and Malaysia continue to host Myanmar refugees, he highlighted the dangers of forced repatriation back to the origin country. He urged that transparent access to relevant United Nations agencies be maintained, calling on the international community to increase assistance to the country and its displaced persons before it is too late.\n\nNARMIN AHANGARI ( Azerbaijan ) said refugees and internally displaced persons are among the most vulnerable populations of the world, adding that the international community has a duty to assess their movements by developing multilateral responses critical for responding to their needs. She stressed the importance of finding a durable solution for forcibly displaced persons fleeing conflicts, who must be allowed to return to their homes. Azerbaijan formerly had a great number of refugees due to the conflict with Armenia. After signing the Trilateral Statement of 10 November 2020, several thousand refugees in Azerbaijan were able to enjoy their inalienable right to return home. Azerbaijan prioritized the reconstruction of territories involved and their reintegration into the economy, taking practical steps to eliminate the results of the decade-old occupation, reconstructing villages and preparing electronic management systems to implement the return project in an effective and transparent manner. One of the main impediments to return remains the massive contamination of land by landmines and other explosive devices. Obtaining maps of minefields and international capacity-building are critically important to facilitating the return of internally displaced persons.\n\nALEXANDRA ALEXANDRIDOU ( Greece ), aligning with the European Union, pointed to the large influx of refugees in Greece, adding that Frontex (the European border management agency) and the Hellenic Police and Coast Guard continue to save lives at the countrys and European Unions sea borders. Underlining the countrys respect for the principle of non-refoulement, with the support of several non-governmental organizations, she said that Greece currently hosts a significant number of refugees and is advancing policies to promote their care and integration. Noting a shift in the \"voluntary character\" of refugee movement across borders since 2020, she condemned the instrumentalization of human suffering as a political pressure tactic targeted at the European Union and neighbouring States. She called on the international community to condemn these violations of the 1951 Refugee Convention and called on countries to adhere to international law.\n\nBRUNO BERNARDO SERAGE ( Mozambique ), aligning himself with the African Group, said that his State is a country of origin and destination for thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. Thanking States that welcomed Mozambicans fleeing from terrorist attacks and climate change-related events, he said that his country, despite well-known challenges, hosts around 26,195 refugees. Some 30 per cent of them are living in the refugee camp, he said, while 70 per cent are living in urban areas. Citing efforts to locally integrate refugees, he underlined Mozambiques progress in the implementation of pledges made at the first Global Refugee Forum and pointed to a Memorandum of Understanding with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) underpinning a study on statelessness in his country.\n\nHALLEY CHRISTINE YAPI NE BAH ( Cte dIvoire ), noting that 100 million people are forcibly displaced globally due to conflicts, violence, discrimination or climate change, invited States to refrain from actions that will undermine peace and security. Turning to the impact of climate change on movement, solutions include restoration of degraded soil, fighting deforestation and revising public policy to strengthen agriculture investments, she said. Noting that, since 2011, out of the more than 300,000 people forced to flee her country, some 280,000 Ivorians have returned home, she pointed to ongoing instability in the Sahel, which is forcing people to seek refuge in Cte dIvoire. Calling for UNHCRs support to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, she invited stakeholders to address the deficit the agency is facing.\n\nASHISH SHARMA ( India ) said his country has welcomed refugees from all over the world throughout history, despite its own development- and security-related challenges. India has been practicing voluntary repatriations, he said, noting that refugee communities are protected under the countrys pluralistic framework. Indias Constitution guarantees basic rights for all persons, including the right to life, equality before the law and equal protection of laws. India has clearly demonstrated its abiding commitment to the principle of protection, he stressed, adding that the refugee issue is a global challenge, which no country can resolve. In this context, he supported the central role of the United Nations in dealing with refugee issues.\n\nMs. LORTIPANIDZE ( Georgia ) noted the record high number of forcefully displaced persons this year, which has surpassed 100 million. Since February, more than 18 million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes following the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine, she said, stressing that Georgia has received and is supporting more than 28,000 war-affected Ukrainians. Considering the global compact on refugees as an expression of the political will of States to resolve the refugee crisis, she said the instrument will lead to a new pragmatic approach towards a global system, where the responsibility is shared. Highlighting the impact of the Russian Federations aggression against her country, she said that \"since 1991, as a result of multiple waves of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Russian Federation in Georgias Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia regions, about half a million Georgian citizens have been expelled from their homes to become internally displaced persons and refugees\". \"They are still deprived of the right to return to their homes,\" she said, adding that \"Russias continuous destructive actions in occupied territories put many more at risk of becoming internally displaced\".\n\nTERESA MANUEL BENTO DA SILVA ( Angola ) recalled her countrys refugee influx, mostly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2017 and its subsequent work with the UNHCR. She hailed the agencys work in the current context of a growing refugee crisis, providing health care, HIV prevention, food security and access to hygiene. As climate change displaces more people, Angola renews its commitments to care for them, as it has experience hosting more than 50,000 refugees from a 27-year-long conflict. The country will continue to participate in peacebuilding processes, she said, noting that it recently became a part of peacekeeping operations.\n\nELIE ALTARSHA ( Syria ) said Syrian refugees are suffering delays in receiving identity cards, adding that there are also delays in family reunification. There have been three conferences in Damascus on redeveloping places where refugees are being housed. There is a great deal of pressure on Syria from some States and international organizations, which are refusing to participate in this work. Due to terrorism in the region, the Government has been working to implement essential services to facilitate the return of refugees and restoring centers, which has made it easier for 1 million refugees returning from Jordan, Iraq and Trkiye. Terrorism has sowed conflict across the country and drained resources, which is why there are so many refugees abroad. Roughly 80 per cent of oil production is disappearing every day, causing shortages in energy, fuel and drinking water. Syria is facing a political agenda leading to the suffering of its people and is not responsible for this crisis. Rebuilding the infrastructure is necessary to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees. The Israeli occupation of Palestine and the Syrian Golan is also a cause for displacement of 5 million Palestinians and half a million Syrians.\n\nAMANUEL GIORGIO ( Eritrea ), aligning himself with the African Group and the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations, said that massive displacement, largely in developing countries, has destabilizing effects on regional security and socioeconomic developments. Adding that addressing this means dealing with its underlying causes, he said political will to resolve conflicts peacefully, non-interference in affairs of States and stronger global partnerships to support sustainable development are critical. Inviting countries of origin, transit and destination to bear their responsibilities, he said the UNHCR should focus on refugees, instead of persons of concern or migrants. Expressing concern about emergencies in some countries of transit subjecting refugees and migrants to violence, abuse and forced recruitment, he urged the UNHCR to extend full protection to the stranded in conflict areas. Eritrea maintains a voluntary repatriation policy of its nationals and opposes any forced repatriation or expulsions, he added. Citing some countries bilateral agreements on the processing of asylum-seekers, he said \"the offshoring of refugees from the countries of their arrival and shipping them off to another continent against their will is immoral and undignified, amounting to inhumane treatment of refugees\".\n\nMOHAMMAD AAMIR KHAN ( Pakistan ), voicing concern over the record number of refugees and displaced persons, recalled that his country has demonstrated unparalleled hospitality in hosting refugees for four decades and adhered to the highest standards of protection, which continued during the pandemic. Today, Pakistan hosts 1.4 million Afghan refugees and 850,000 Afghan citizen card holders, he stressed, noting that refugees have free enrolment to primary schools, access to higher education and bank accounts, while numerous livelihood opportunities are open to them. Pakistan has also supported complex humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, facilitating evacuations as well as providing food and other supplies. He said that the UNHCR should be sensitive to local requirements of refugee-hosting countries and ensure implementation of its policies consistent with the local environment.\n\nMr. CANDIDO DARE ( Ethiopia ) said that his country hosts close to 1 million refugees from 26 countries and continues to work with the UNHCR to provide necessary services, despite insufficient international support. Ethiopia has integrated refugees into its school and university systems and provides them with health care, in collaboration with the UNHCR. Turning to climate change-induced displacement, he said that the country is immensely affected and has taken measures to combat it, such as using alternative energy sources and planting seedlings in and around refugee camps. Urging the international community to share the burden of responsibility in line with the Global Compact for Refugees, he noted that the country operates at 46 per cent of a minimum standard refugee operation. While the country hosts many refugees in its northern region, it also has millions of internally displaced persons, he said, calling on the UNHCR for more support.\n\nMITCHELL FIFIELD ( Australia ), expressing concern about extraordinary levels of displacement, noted that a tragic milestone has passed, with more than 100 million people now displaced globally. Pointing to the significant funding gap facing the UNHCR, he stressed that responding to the impacts of Moscows war in Ukraine will require additional resources. To this end, he highlighted the value of flexible funding and encouraged the UNHCR to diversify its funding base. At a time of unprecedented global displacement, he recognized the need to provide additional pathways for refugees and displaced people to safely move to third countries. Australia is piloting new approaches to complementary pathways, including through labour mobility and sponsorship. Moreover, welcoming the UNHCRs 2022-2025 operational strategy for climate resilience and environmental sustainability, he noted that over 80 per cent of refugees and internally displaced peoples come from the most climate-vulnerable parts of the world. The Indo-Pacific is a region particularly prone to climate-driven disasters, and therefore likely increased displacement, he added.\n\nAYSE INAN RNEKOL ( Trkiye ) said that one hundred million people displaced worldwide is a stark reality, not only for those who have left their homes, but also for communities hosting them. The human tragedy of displacement is compounded by the financial and socioeconomic hardships experienced by host countries and communities. They need meaningful solidarity in line with the principle of burden and responsibility sharing. Finding durable solutions to crises not only requires providing humanitarian aid to the people in need, but also working in a coordinated manner to strengthen the resilience of refugees and host communities, pursuing a multistakeholder and \"whole of society\" approach. Furthermore, the international community should step up collective efforts in addressing the root causes of forced displacement. Trkiye recognizes the UNHCRs unique role and mandate in assisting and protecting persons of concern in the most vulnerable situations, but is concerned about its constant funding gap. Trkiye is currently hosting close to 4 million people displaced due to conflicts in the vicinity, most of them Syrians. It is crucial that Syrians can return to their homes in safety and peace, play a role in the future of their country and contribute to the redevelopment and establishment of lasting peace in Syria.\n\nENIAN LAMCE ( Albania ), voicing concern over the dire humanitarian situation in many parts of the world, condemned Moscows unjustified aggression against Ukraine, which has caused the largest displacement crisis in Europe since the Second World War. As a result of the aggression, some 7.7 million Ukrainians were constrained to leave their country, while around 7 million are internally displaced. Women and children who are fleeing conflict are exposed to a higher risk of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking, he said. In this context, he called for improved protection for displaced persons, legal tools for effective protection and better support for the work of United Nations agencies and humanitarian partners. He underscored the need to create conditions for the safe return of displaced persons to their countries of origin. In the past three years, the Government of Albania has taken efforts to support the needs of refugees and displaced persons, he stressed, pointing to Afghan refugees in Albania who are cared for and safe. Moreover, the new law on citizenship grants Albanian citizenship to all children born in Albania who would otherwise be stateless.\n\nJELENA LEKOVI ( Montenegro ) voiced concern over the tragic milestone of 94.7 million people forced to flee their homes, facing great unpredictability in the context of food, climate and energy crises as well as ongoing conflicts. This alarming situation requires a response based on responsibility-sharing and solidarity, she stressed, adding that Montenegro has provided shelter to many displaced persons who fled as a result of conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Since then, significant progress has been made in improving their socioeconomic status, with a special focus on education, health care and social protection. Through its regional housing programme, Montenegro has provided permanent housing for 6,000 displaced or internally displaced persons. Condemning Moscows unjustified war of aggression against a sovereign State that has resulted in the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, she said her country has provided a timely response to Ukrainian refugees, keeping its borders open since the beginning of the war.\n\nYAMANAKA OSAMU ( Japan ) said that the Russian Federations aggression against Ukraine has put many people in danger, with its effects felt throughout the world. Japan has provided approximately $40 million in humanitarian and transport support. Highlighting the needs of neighboring countries in hosting refugees, he expressed concern that other humanitarian crises are not adequately funded. To ensure solidarity and the principles of the global compact for refugees, Japan will continue its support and co-sponsor the Global Refugee Forum in 2023, he said. Voicing support for admitting displaced persons to third countries as a way of burden-sharing, he hailed the UNHCRs work.\n\nCELIA KAFUREKA NABETA ( Uganda ) said her country remains committed to shouldering its responsibilities and obligations in addressing the plight of refugees as well as positive change under the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework. The African Union declared 2019 as the African year of refugees, returnees and displaced persons, and recommitted to address the structural and root causes of displacement, such as protracted violent conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, natural disasters and calamities and climate change. African leaders committed to bold and effective political leadership in resolving conflicts in Africa through adopting policies and strategies that strengthen national systems and structures. Uganda will continue to promote peace and security in the region and contribute to addressing the root causes of displacement.\n\nBORIS HOLOVKA ( Serbia ) said Serbia is one of the countries with the highest number of internally displaced persons in Europe and one of only five countries in the world with a protracted displacement crisis. Due to the Balkan wars in the nineties, more than half a million Serbs were forced to flee or be expelled from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbia has been making efforts to provide them with an appropriate reception and care, and create conditions for a sustainable return to their homes. However, there is not always understanding and willingness from the involved parties to work together and find a permanent solution. More than 200,000 people were forced to leave their homes in the southern province of Kosovo and Metohija, seeking safety and protection from the systematic persecution to which non-Albanians are consistently exposed in the province. The conditions for a sustainable return have not been achieved and basic human and civil rights of internally displaced persons are not respected.\n\nMs. BOUZID ( Morocco ) said the Algerian delegation tried once again in its intervention to exploit and politicize todays debate to serve its own biased political agenda on the Moroccan Sahara. Last week the Security Council passed a resolution once again that established and enshrined the unique parameters of this regional dispute, namely a political, realistic and sustainable solution underlined by compromise, including census-taking of people trapped in the Tindouf camps. The question of the Moroccan Sahara is an issue of territorial integrity and national unity for Morocco. Responsibility-sharing and solidarity go in hand, and Algeria is responsible for ensuring that conditions for the registration of persons trapped in the camps are in place. Morocco denounces in the strongest terms the exploitation and instrumentalization of people trapped in camps for the political agenda of Algeria. One of the most terrible expressions of this is the recruitment of child soldiers in the Tindouf camps. There are proven links between the Frente POLISARIO and terrorist groups in the Sahel. Further, Algeria misappropriates humanitarian funds and has done so for years, shamefully using the generous humanitarian assistance provided by the international community for other purposes.\n\nDENISSE G. GOMEZ ZEPEDA, a representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , pointing to unprecedented levels of global displacement, called for a holistic approach to access food, water, employment and health services, while fostering greater integration into local communities. She stressed that refugees must be treated with dignity, irrespective of their country of origin. Moreover, all people on the move must have access to essential services during their migration journey, especially quality health and psychosocial services. Mental health conditions are much more prevalent among refugees than host populations, making them acutely vulnerable to major gaps in the mental health systems worldwide, she noted, stressing the importance of universal health coverage. \"Its time to recognise that there is no health without mental health,\" she added. The impact of climate change amplifies vulnerability and drives displacement, she said, calling on States to scale up climate-smart actions, disaster risk measures and integration of local actors, including refugee-led organizations.\n\nRight of Reply\n\nSpeaking in exercise of the right of reply, the representative of the Russian Federation said that Ukraines delegate has misinformation about his country. Pointing to Ukrainian nationalist policy suppressing the use of the Russian language in Ukraine, he said that there are 8 million Russian speakers there, but that number could have been higher before the 2014 coup. Further, because of Kyivs civil war, 4.5 million refugees have fled and found protection in Russian Federation territory. They have come voluntarily with their children, he said, fleeing constant shelling and intimidation. Though Ukraines delegate called for the return of these children, he expressed concern over their potential forced Ukrainization as the Russian language is forbidden in schools. Dispelling the delegates claims that his country is playing hunger games, he said the Russian Federation is participating in the Black Sea agreements, but most of that food from Ukraine is destined for developed, European Union countries, while only 3 per cent is promised to developing countries.\n\nThe representative of Algeria , speaking in the right to reply, addressed falsifications uttered by Morocco, the occupying power in the Western Sahara. He said the situation there has been decided by the United Nations, and is on the agenda of the Fourth Committee. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) is undertaking a referendum to allow the people there to decide their destiny. The occupying power is uttering falsehoods to justify an illegal and unethical position. The census of Saharawi refugees is part of a wider solution that will allow them to determine their destiny and is nothing more than a technical issue. Since 2017 many United Nations agencies have visited, and they have an approximate census that responds to the needs of the Saharawis. Algeria rejects the report of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office in 2007, which was excluded by the European Commission after an internal audit. The Commission confirmed that humanitarian assistance to the Saharawis is under strict control, he said, stressing that there is no proof of any misappropriations. MINURSO continues to take note of bombardments by the Algerian air force, he said, adding that it is clearly the Moroccan army using drones and targeting civilians.\n\nSpeaking in exercise of the right of reply, the representative of Morocco said that Algeria falsely presented itself as a responsible humanitarian actor, whereas in reality it violates the rights of people in the Tindouf camps daily by depriving them of humanitarian assistance, complicit with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Frente POLISARIO). Algerias refusal to register the people in the camps is a violation of the 1951 Convention on Refugees as well as the 2011 Security Council decision, she added. Algerias shameful misappropriation of humanitarian funds over five decades is well documented, as is the Frente POLISARIOs recruitment of child soldiers, she said, highlighting photos of children carrying weapons. To the question of the Moroccan Sahara, she asked the Algerian delegate who houses the Frente POLISARIO on their territory and finances them.\n\nThe representative of Algeria , speaking in a second exercise of the right of reply, rejected the lies of the occupying power in Western Sahara, while stressing the need for accountability. The refugee camps are visited by international organizations, he said, noting that the UNHCR visited the refugee camps in 2017, without any obstacles put in place by Algeria. This is not the case for the Moroccan authorities, who have prevented the representative of the Secretary-General from vising Western Sahara. He further denounced Moroccos fabrication about child recruitment in refugee camps, adding that such accusations are not only targeted against Algeria but also the United Nations.\n\nSpeaking for a second time in exercise of the right of reply, the representative of Morocco called on her Algerian colleague to produce figures of refugees for the Committee, underscoring that she cited United Nations and European Union documentation pointing to a politicization of the situation. Further, she called on Algeria to allow the UNHCR to take a full census of refugees in the Tindouf camps, as it is necessary to distribute humanitarian aid. She refuted Algerias claims of recruitment in the camps, adding that the photos were taken inside the camps and not photoshopped.\n\nInteractive Dialogue: President of the Human Rights Council\n\nFEDERICO VILLEGAS, President of the Human Rights Council, briefing the Committee on its annual report (document A/77/53), said it has adopted 100 resolutions and held 18 general debates. The Council has considered new resolutions on neurotechnologies and human rights cyberbullying along with new technologies in the military sector, underscoring the Councils prevention-oriented thinking to protect human rights in the future. The Council also held an urgent debate on human rights in Ukraine following the Russian aggression, resulting in the establishment of an Independent Commission of Inquiry. He recalled another urgent debate on women and girls in Afghanistan, noting the importance of the presence of Afghan women themselves in providing witness accounts.\n\nFurther, hailing the participation of civil society actors in the Councils activities, he underscored the Councils role as a place for victims voices to be heard, as those actors are integral in understanding situations on the ground as well as in change-making and capacity-building. The Council heard more than 2,400 interventions from non-governmental organizations and participated in 72 events organized by civic society groups. Highlighting the importance of equal participation, he said that the voluntary trust fund has allowed 26 delegates to travel to the Council from small island developing and least developed countries. Though the Council operates in hybrid electronic and in-person meetings, he said nothing can replace in-person shared knowledge. Those delegates passed on their experience to their Governments, he said, describing it as a \"virtuous cycle\". Welcoming 100 per cent participation among States in the Universal Periodic Review, the Council adopted a resolution expanding the voluntary trust fund.\n\nThe mandate of the Council has evolved over the years to become the main body of the United Nations for human rights, working with a high degree of autonomy and guaranteeing its effectiveness, he said. This independence must be protected in the current increasingly complicated geopolitical context. At the same time, he underscored the grave importance of maintaining the spirit of constructive dialogue when adopting resolutions of the Human Rights Council, whether they be country-specific or thematic. It is legitimate for each country to have a national position to defend, he added, but the Council is both a multilateral and a democratic body governed by clear rules that Member States approved to adopt a decision. Once a resolution is adopted, it deserves to be respected, he said, stressing that States cannot \"cherry-pick\". Calling on the Committee to work together to promote the Councils work, he added that it is the responsibility of the Fifth Committee to allocate sufficient resources for its mandate to be implemented with collective will.\n\nRecalling that 47 Member States were elected by 193 Member States to protect human rights throughout the world, he stressed that the Councils debates are not Geneva-specific but concern the entire world. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the entire United Nations to strengthen the work of a Council tasked with human rights, he said. In a context of pandemics, climate change and armed conflicts, now more than ever, \"We must be keenly aware that there can be no peace nor security without human rights.\"\n\nIn the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of the Netherlands , associating with the European Union, said respect for human rights included fostering a culture of accountability and justice for victims and survivors of human rights violations. Stressing the importance of civil society, he asked the President about ways to ensure safe access for civil society organizations and human rights defenders to the Council.\n\nThe representative of Australia , on behalf of other countries, stressed the importance of promoting the rights of indigenous peoples. The Human Rights Councils duty is to examine human rights violations, wherever they may be. No situation or country should be considered above the Councils scrutiny, she asserted, underscoring the importance of accountability and multilateralism. She asked how the Council can engage with smaller and less-resourced countries, including small island developing States, to ensure their voices are heard within the body.\n\nAlong similar lines, the representative of the Republic of Korea highlighted the unprecedented challenges faced by the Human Rights Council this year. In multiple human rights and humanitarian emergencies from Ukraine to Afghanistan the Council has taken meaningful action, she observed, encouraging the Council to monitor and investigate serious human rights violations worldwide. She asked the President how New York and Geneva can enhance its collaboration.\n\nThe representative of Latvia , speaking on behalf of the Nordic Baltic Countries, condemned human rights violations stemming from Moscows unprovoked war against Ukraine. Calling for the establishment of an Independent International Commission of Inquiry, he welcomed the Councils recently adopted resolutions on human rights situations in the Russian Federation, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Syria and Ethiopia. He lamented that the Council decided against holding a debate on the High Commissioners Xinjiang report.\n\nThe representative of Chile , advocating for the promotion of dialogue with all actors, drew attention to the protection of the rights of women, children, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities. He asked the President about ways to support the work of the Council.\n\nMeanwhile, the representative of Cameroon , calling for dialogue and mutual understanding, opposed politicization of the Councils work. The Council is a political body; however, the President has an essential role in keeping discussions balanced and fostering understanding among delegations, she stressed.\n\nEchoing her concerns, the representative of Cuba , noting that human rights need to be tackled based on the principle of non-selectivity, objected to punitive activities, double standards, and manipulations. She also rejected unilateral coercive measures, such as Washingtons embargo against Cuba.\n\nIn the same vein, the representative of Ethiopia voiced concern about the worrisome trend of instrumentalization of human rights issues to corner Governments, which is contrary to the principle of universality, impartiality and non-selectivity. Country-specific resolutions and mandates are counterproductive and defeat the true purpose of the Council, she asserted, warning against hidden political agendas and double standards.\n\nThe representative of China , warning against intensified politicization of the Council, rejected interference of Western countries in Chinas internal affairs. The Council rejected the draft decision and does not recognize the assessment of Xinjiang, he stressed, describing it as \"a collective victory of all developing countries\". Criticizing hypocrisy and double standards of Western countries, he urged them to rectify their violations of human rights.\n\nAlso speaking were representatives of Costa Rica, Latvia, Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, United Kingdom, Morocco, Malawi, Nigeria, El Salvador, France, Syria, Angola and Italy (associating with the European Union).\n\nMr. VILLEGAS, responding, stressed the need to share best practises throughout all regions on working with non-governmental organizations protecting human rights. Supporting human rights depends on the ownership of all, he said, including the private and public sectors, to raise awareness and obtain adequate resources. Limits to sovereignty when there is a need to protect citizens must be defined, he said, citing discussions in this regard. Pointing to retaliation, he highlighted the case of an Expert reporting in Geneva and being banned from returning to her country and children. They were able to join their mother four months later in Switzerland, he said, calling it one of the most serious violations he is aware of.\n\nTurning to cooperation and overcoming divergence, he said that discussions on proposals sometimes lead to \"politicization, which becomes polarization\", which leads to paralysis and undermines work, which must be prevented. Further, he stressed the key role of the Universal Periodic Review, which provides a roadmap agreed on by States and involving multiple actors, representing an ideal way to move forward with cooperation. Turning to gender parity, he stressed that 70 per cent of the 23 Independent Experts were women, noting that a rule adopted in Geneva bans any panel or event without gender parity among speakers. Noting that no country has a higher moral status than others or perfect records on human rights, he emphasized the importance of looking at facts and reality. Emphasizing that the Council was created to address human rights issues, he said that Rapporteurs may tell States things they do not agree with, but those are the rules of the game, he said, stressing the need to find a way to cooperate with these mechanisms.\n\nGeneral Debate Statements\n\nMs. MORUKE ( South Africa ) hailed the Human Rights Councils work on gender parity, underscoring the importance of the multilateral forum. South Africa works to ensure economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development, she said, adding that her delegation supports a balanced approach. The country takes a firm stance against poverty, racism, xenophobia and discrimination, she said, stressing that a society that ignores racism is a society ignoring its past crimes and their effects, which establish inequality inside and between States. Calling for a Human Rights Council free from selectivity, she encouraged States to look at each problem in its context. South Africa takes a stand against political agendas seeking to undermine States collaboration, she said, thanking Member States for its election to the Council for the 2023-2025 period.\n\nMs. ALMEHAID ( Saudi Arabia ) drew attention to her countrys reforms and improved legal remedies. Expressing support for human rights defenders, she stressed that reforms in Saudi Arabia go beyond human rights. Her Government continues its internal reforms while striving to aid all people affected by conflict and disasters throughout the world, in cooperation with United Nations agencies. In 2021, Saudi Arabia was the third-largest donor country, she said, reaffirming her countrys commitment to protecting human rights and cooperating with the United Nations.\n\nASHISH SHARMA ( India ) said that the strength of the Human Rights Council lies in its emphasis on dialogue and non-selectivity in its promotion of human rights. He spotlighted the right to development, protection of human rights in cyber space, emerging technologies and genetics as areas where the Council does important work. He called on the Council to take a firm stance on terrorism, which impedes the right to life. However, that agenda must be pursued with respect for non-interference in internal affairs of States, underscoring the importance of constructive dialogue. Country-specific initiatives must be carried out with the consent of concerned countries, he said, favouring the Universal Periodic Review, rather than of naming and shaming.\n\nELIE ALTARSHA ( Syria ) reiterated his countrys position against the politicization of certain rights as well as mechanisms carrying out their mandates without the approval of concerned States. He expressed firm opposition to the Commission created for Syria and rejected its reports. It is not only politicized and non-objective but supports terrorist and separatist groups in the country. The mechanisms represent a selective approach serving the interests of a certain number of States, promoting erroneous concepts falling outside the mandate of the Human Rights Council. He added that unilateral coercive measures are proof of selectivity and double standards.\n\nDAHMANE YAHIAOUI ( Algeria ), advocating against politicization of human rights issues, reiterated the necessity of the principles of independence, impartiality and non-selectivity. He called for coordination with concerned States and for a comprehensive inclusive process to establish mutual trust and avoid double standards. He also underscored the importance of an inclusive approach to human rights, as all human rights, including the right to development, are intertwined. Reiterating the importance of technical cooperation and capacity-building for States in line with their needs, he drew attention to institutional reforms in Algeria.\n\nELIZABETH NORALMA MENDEZ GRUEZO ( Ecuador ) stressed that the Universal Periodic Review allows for civil society organizations to speak. Underscoring the need for the participation of women in the Council, she called on States to tackle the root causes of conflicts to prevent their re-emergence. To this end, she stressed the need for effective mechanisms to maintain peace.\n\nTERESA MANUEL BENTO DA SILVA ( Angola ) expressed appreciation for the technical assistance and capacity-building that the Council provides. Her country has a long history of enacting human rights legislation since its independence and has adopted all relevant conventions to assure human rights for children, migrant workers and refugees, which are necessary for the Sustainable Development Goals. Highlighting the countrys policy on persons with disabilities, she said the Constitution ensures they are treated well, outlining similar frameworks protecting the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. The country recently joined the Blue Heart Campaign of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) and is drafting an action plan combating human trafficking, she added.\n\nXAVIER BELLMONT ROLDAN ( Spain ) noted that recent months were marked by the war of aggression in Ukraine, hailing work to keep it on the United Nations agenda, in stark contrast to a backsliding of human rights in other countries. Underscoring multilateralism to create a fairer world, he spotlighted his countrys candidacy to the Council for the 2025-2027 period. He expressed support for the call to contribute more financial resources to the Council, adding that its rising workload has increased its sessions to 14 weeks from its original 11.\n\nMs. BROSSARD ( Cuba ) said the promotion and protection of human rights must take place in line with the principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. She stressed the need to keep the Council away from practices of politicization and double standards, noting that States are using human rights to attack countries of the South and that some States are subject to universal coercive measures that impact human rights. She added that the Universal Periodic Review must be upheld, as it guarantees non-discrimination. More needs to be done to promote the right to development, peace, a healthy environment and international solidarity, she added, calling on the Council to denounce the impact of universal coercive measures on human rights.\n\nMs. BOUZID ( Morocco ) noted her countrys commitment to respect and safeguard human rights at the national and international levels, pointing to regulatory reforms to promote human rights in her State. She noted that Morocco has recently been elected to the Council for the period 2023-2025. This testifies to the credibility of reforms and the countrys constructive action for strengthening the role of the Council as the architect of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism.\n\nDANIEL ZAVALA PORRAS ( Costa Rica ) called for the development of national capacities and establishment of tools for early warnings to prevent violations of human rights and international law. Despite not being a Member, Costa Rica actively takes part in the work of the Council, he said, stressing the importance of the human right to a clean, safe and sustainable environment. Voicing concern over all forms of violence against women and girls, he underscored the need to strengthen the national regulatory framework to address gender violence in all its forms.\n\nMARIA THEOFILI ( Greece ) said that worldwide events confirm the important and necessary work of the Human Rights Council. Highlighting her countrys participation in the Council, she recalled its submission to the Universal Periodic Review and a visit by the Special Rapporteur about Human Rights Defenders. The country participates as part of a group of States and constructively engages in interactive dialogues, debates and other events, she said. Further, Greece has adopted action plans, including on the rights of the child and persons with disabilities. Highlighting its candidacy for a seat on the Council for the 2028-2030 period, she said that Greeces election will have a positive impact on the Councils vital work.\n\nNELLY BANAKEN ELEL ( Cameroon ) said that for Human Rights Council resolutions to be effective on the ground, principles of non-selectivity and objectivity must be respected and adhered to through dialogue. Describing instrumentalization as non-productive, she called on the Council to adopt a non-conflictual approach. Stressing the interdependence of human rights, she emphasized the need for large investments in technology and infrastructure to support the right to development as well as social, cultural and economic rights. Adding that Cameroon will always give priority to the most vulnerable, including refugees, migrants and people of African descent in the African diaspora, she said: \"It is in the way we treat the weakest that the greatness of society is measured.\"\n\nFATEMEH ARAB BAFRANI ( Iran ), aligning with the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations, voiced concern that multilateralism is giving way to unilateralism. Condemning unilateral coercive measures against populations in developing countries, she said that constructive dialogue should be the bedrock of the Councils work, with the Universal Periodic Review as the mechanism examining human rights in States. She lamented increased politicization and the manipulative nature of the Councils work. Reiterating her countrys position rejecting country-specific mandates, she said her delegation disassociates itself from the report. Affirming that all States must be allowed to participate in United Nations human rights mechanisms, she expressed concerns over other countries human rights violations, including the United States, the Israeli regime, Canada and the United Kingdom, which are guilty of apartheid, hate speech, attacks against Muslims and discrimination against indigenous peoples.\n\nNNAMDI OKECHUKWU NZE ( Nigeria ) noted that some treaty bodies have mainstreamed controversial topics such as abortion into their work. This constitutes a broadening of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights without negotiation by the States, he said, calling on treaty bodies to refrain from this mendacity. States have the duty to ensure that families as well as religious and cultural values are protected, he said. These mechanisms are misused, he continued, pointing to the Human Rights Councils follow-up procedure to review its abortion legislation and allow unimpeded access to sexual health services. He said nations should be able to opt out of the follow-up procedure like the simplified reporting procedure.\n\nMUHAMMAD ABDUL MUHITH ( Bangladesh ) underscored his countrys contribution to the Council, particularly on climate change, migration and gender equality, adding that it has recently been elected to the Council for the term 2023-2025. Recalling the visit of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, he also highlighted his countrys close work with various mandate holders, upcoming experts visits and its preparation for the next Universal Periodic Review. Welcoming adoption of the Council resolution on the human rights situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, he called on States to provide full support to mechanisms established in Myanmar. Pointing to the resolution on human rights and climate change, he noted that his country contributes little to global emissions but suffers adverse climate consequences. On the resolution addressing genocide prevention, he called for recognition of past tragedies, including the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, and accountability.\n\nAMANUEL GIORGIO ( Eritrea ), noting that the agenda of the Human Rights Council is overburdened, pointed to the ever-increasing number of new initiatives, along with reduced time allocated for intergovernmental discussions. The proliferation of special procedures and commissions of inquiry has put extra burdens on the Councils resources, he observed. Opposing political manipulation and double standards, he underlined that country-specific resolutions undermine attempts to constructively work towards resolving human rights challenges.\n\nYAMANAKA OSAMU ( Japan ), voicing concern about continuing human rights and humanitarian situations around the world, reiterated that, as a current member of the Human Rights Council, his country strives to improve human rights through both multilateral settings and bilateral dialogues. To this end, he pointed to the draft resolutions submitted by his delegation, one on technical assistance for Cambodia and the second on protection of human rights in the Philippines. He underscored that the human rights of all people should be respected, regardless of their countries cultures, political and economic systems and levels of socioeconomic development.",

Accepting Russias blackmail automatically signals victory to Kremlin. Any hope that the negotiations will end the suffering and deaths of Ukrainians is more than naive, the New Europe center says in response to new calls on Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. [/editorial]\n\nWhat Russian President Vladimir Putin has not achieved through military action, he hopes to accomplish through negotiations. When Moscow talks about negotiations, it does not mean a process that should result in stable and equitable peace.\n\nEven though democratic governments worldwide support Ukraines position, which rejects the Kremlins ultimatums, politicians and private individuals continue to press Kyiv to begin negotiations with the aggressor.\n\nAccepting Russias blackmail will signal to the Kremlin that it has won and can continue to impose new conditions as much as they want, threatening another offensive, the use of nuclear weapons, and so on. Hopes that these negotiations will end the suffering and deaths of Ukrainians are more than naive. Therefore, the New Europe Center puts forth several arguments demonstrating that talks with Putin at this point are tantamount to declaring defeat.\n\nFrom economic pressure to nuclear threats\n\nThere were also enough Ukrainian politicians who genuinely believed that appeasing the Kremlin would ensure stability and mutually beneficial cooperation between Kyiv and Moscow. For example, in 2010, the authoritarian Viktor Yanukovych, known for his loyalty to Russia, became Ukraines president. During his first negotiations with the Russian leadership, he attempted to obtain a gas discount in exchange for promising not to integrate the state into NATO. The Russians, of course, did not agree to this.\n\nRussian diplomats gloated about their victory in private conversations: \"Yanukovych will give up NATO himself because thats what his voters want. Why should we pay for it? We will wait for new business proposals that will be of interest to us.\"\n\nWithin a few months, the world learned about these \"business proposals.\" Certainly, Yanukovych personified a non-alignment policy by veering off the NATO course. This decision ultimately did not protect Ukraine from Russias military aggression. As Russia began with the occupation of Crimea in February 2014.\n\nThere are numerous instances in the history of Ukrainian-Russian relations with Moscow compelling Kyiv to make unfavorable concessions to maintain stable relations or, more bluntly, appease the insatiable Russian elite. Constant concessions and adherence to compromises did not protect Ukraine but resulted in an insidious, vicious attack on millions of peaceful Ukrainians.\n\nRussia perceived Ukraine as a sphere of its influence. It could not allow Ukrainians to determine their fate. The issue was not whether Ukraine wanted to join the EU and NATO; instead, Vladimir Putin was infuriated by the Ukrainians innate democratic nature and contempt for post-Soviet political elites. He saw the Orange Revolution of 2004 and then the Revolution of Dignity of 2013-14 as threats to order in Russia and thus to his political survival.\n\nInitially, Putin attempted to economically bind Ukraine to Russia. At times, he used internal political crises, such as the isolation of the Ukrainian government under Leonid Kuchma, to increase Russian influence.\n\nHowever, Ukraine proved resilient enough to rebuke Putins numerous imperial plans.\n\nRussias attempts to subdue Ukraine entered a new phase with the beginning of aggressive actions in 2014.\n\nWhen Moscows eight years of covert interventions failed to coerce obstinate Ukraine, it launched a large-scale invasion, complete with \"little green men\" and covert maneuvers. But this plan failed, too, as the international community met Putin with a backlash that neither Russia nor the West could have predicted. The military adventure, which was supposed to end in days with a triumph, resulted in erasing the image of the invincible Russian army and Russias isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nRegardless of his approval ratings, Putins political future looks more precarious than ever. In times of deep crisis, public opinion can quickly shift from adoration to outright hostility. Most importantly, Putin does not have the arrogance to dismiss the dangers he has created for himself.\n\nPutins weakening does not imply that he is ready for compromises or the end of the war. He will continue to shed innocent blood until the Russian army suffers a strategic defeat on the battlefield and Russian society suffers the painful consequences of its militaristic intoxication.\n\nA brief excursion into the history of Ukraine-Russia relations reveals the evolution of the tools Putin used to achieve the primary goal of regaining influence over Ukrainians. Initially, these were tools of economic and gas blackmail. He later shifted to nuclear attack threats. Consequently, what have the Ukrainians learned from Putins special operations in other nations? The conflict will never end if one makes concessions to Russia because compromises only lead to new ultimatums.\n\nWhy the Russia-Ukraine peace talks promise is not to be trusted\n\nThe New Europe Center highlights several arguments demonstrating the danger of Moscows new strategy. This strategy involves convincing the world that Russia seeks peace and negotiations. At the same time, Ukraine appears to thwart this sincere aspiration. One hopes that these arguments will be helpful to those who genuinely believe in any agreement with Putin. The following are:\n\n1. Russias will is necessary to end the war\n\nUkraine has fallen victim to Russias unprovoked aggression for the second time in eight years, including the full-scale invasion. The war will end as soon as Russia ceases fire and withdraws from the occupied territories.\n\nMoscow should not be able to manipulate observers. It is evident that Ukraine did not initiate the war. It is waging a liberation struggle against the aggressor. Therefore, Russia does not need to declare its readiness to negotiate. It simply needs to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory.\n\n2. Russia seeks Ukraines surrender, not an equitable peace\n\nSince 2014, Russias war goals have remained unchanged. In particular, the installation of a puppet regime in Ukraine. Given that neither the occupation of Crimea nor a part of Donbas will suffice for Moscow, Russias full-scale war will break out in 2022. Eight years should have been sufficient to understand that Russia says one thing but does another.\n\nThe occupation of Crimea and parts of Donbas was merely the beginning of Putins ominous plan. Russia deliberately created a situation in which Ukraine appears to be intractable. Kyiv warned that the occupation of Ukrainian territory would close the door to negotiation opportunities. Despite this, Putin continued to hold \"pseudo-referendums\" in the occupied territories. To enter negotiations under such terms is tantamount to capitulation and encourages Russia to continue genocide with the tacit approval of the international community.\n\n3. Russia seeks a hiatus to resume a more potent offensive\n\nNegotiation allurement is a tactical move to reduce other countries alertness and recover from battlefield defeats. Mobilization and the transition of defense enterprises to 12-hour workdays indicate that any ceasefire will only be temporary if it happens. Russia would eventually have to relaunch its offensive because Moscow has failed to achieve its primary war objectives.\n\nIn 2014, Russia quietly seized Crimea because Ukraine was unable to resist. Ukrainians were surprised by the Russians treachery. Ukraine believed it was essential to avoid bloodshed and heeded the advice of Western politicians who urged it not to succumb to provocations. Later, it became evident that Russia would not stop at Crimea and expand provocations in Ukraines east and south. At this point, the Russian occupation was limited to specific areas of Donbas only because the Ukrainian army began to resist.\n\nAnyone who has dealt with Russia in the past has recognized that it will carry on with its plan of overthrowing the Ukrainian government and occupying most of its territory.\n\nFor a long time, Moscow attempted to do so by using the \"Minsk process,\" discrediting the Ukrainian authorities, and repeatedly engaging in hybrid interventions in Ukrainian affairs. In February 2022, Russia launched an open offensive after attempting hybrid tactics but failing to accomplish its objective.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine peace talks ruse is one that Ukrainians cannot afford to fall into again.\n\n4. Territorial concessions to Russia foster genocide\n\nNumerous war crimes committed by Russian nationals in Ukraine have been documented to date. Russian war crimes have long been confirmed by the reports of a specially assembled UN Commission. As of 28 September, 36,751 war crimes and 16,484 crimes against national security have been documented in Ukraine as a part of Russias full-scale invasion.\n\nEven in the absence of hostilities, peace at the cost of territorial concessions will imply tens of thousands of new casualties. Russian propaganda urges its troops to commit genocide against the Ukrainian people.\n\nTherefore, anyone who believes that the end of the war will bring an end to Ukrainian deaths is gravely mistaken.\n\nUkraine will likely vanish from Western countries information space, but Russias atrocities will continue if it further occupies Ukrainian territory.\n\nIf one believes in the possibility of the formula \"Peace in exchange for land,\" one must be prepared for the more practical Russian algorithm: \"Genocide in exchange for land.\"\n\nIn addition, Ukrainians will be unable to defend themselves due to another \"peace agreement.\"\n\n5. Russia has repeatedly derailed prior agreements\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine already reached agreements with Putin, commonly known as the \"Minsk Accords.\" Therefore, Kyiv understands well the value of Russias peace commitments. Russia has repeatedly disrupted the Minsk Accords. For instance, on 2 November 2014, Moscow held illegal elections in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts . Despite having reached a ceasefire agreement in February 2015, hostilities continued.\n\nEven the commencement of large-scale military operations is the most damning evidence of Russias disregard for its obligations under peace agreements.\n\nThe new deal with Russia will be the new \"Minsk\" in its most egregious form, which Russia will violate whenever it is convenient.\n\nThe most infamous violation committed by Moscow is the cynical refusal to implement the Budapest Memorandum . Instead, Russia shifted from a guarantor of Ukraines security to an aggressor.\n\n6. Ukrainians seek peace, but not at the expense of their territory\n\nUkraine is most eager to achieve peace, but only a fair and lasting one that will restore stability and end the bloodshed on its soil. The only way to accomplish this is to equip Ukrainians with everything necessary for victory. Negotiations must occur in response to the Ukrainians declaration, not Putins pathetic blackmail.\n\nMost Ukrainians, 87%, are unwilling to make territorial concessions to swiftly end the war with Russia. Even in the countrys east, which has seen intense fighting, 85 percent of the local population opposes concessions.\n\nPanicked calls for negotiations from Western officials or celebrities, which Russia sees as a weakness, encourage it to use terror and attacks against civilians. Its ultimate goal is to force the West and Ukraine to give up the liberation struggle. Russia understands only the language of force.\n\nThus, only a concerted effort of Ukraine and the worlds democracies will result in victory and a sense of lasting peace.\n\nWhy listen to Ukrainians?\n\nPutin achieved victory on multiple occasions by intimidating opponents and posing as an irrational actor. The West should not fall for the Russian ruse to save Putins face.\n\nIn 2014, the West urged Ukraine to relinquish Crimea, diplomatically stating, \"Kyiv should not succumb to provocations.\" However, the Ukrainians forced concession only delayed the war and did not prevent it. The West loosened sanctions and maintained cooperation with Putin. Today, the West has a special moral obligation to resist further deceptive proposals from the Russian president.\n\nThrough propaganda, Putin has had ample opportunities to create an imitation of victory. More than 70% of Russians only supported the war because Putin initiated it.\n\nIf Putin initiates peace, the same 70% will gladly support it. Nobody is better placed than Putin to save his face. He craves victory. However, after failing to achieve it through war, he attempts to accomplish his objectives through ostensible negotiations.\n\nDemocracies should respond rationally: no more concessions to the blackmailer. Otherwise, Moscow will issue new ultimatums. Putin will continue to engage in blackmail if we consent to it now. One must take nuclear threats seriously.\n\nHowever, Russia cannot use them to persuade Ukraine to cede its territories. On the contrary, the blackmailer will realize that his threats are effective.\n\nDuring the current full-scale invasion, Ukraine demonstrated its commitment to negotiations. In Istanbul, it made a proposal in March containing extremely painful concessions.\n\nIn exchange, Ukraine received an intensified Russian attack, war crimes in multiple cities, and the grain agreements blockade.\n\nWestern governments have learned that only Ukraine should determine the time for negotiations. It would also be appropriate if the West, which has made too many concessions to Russias imperial ambitions, supported the Ukrainians in every way possible.\n\nThe recipe is simple. Three ingredients are required: contribution to victory, unity, and decisiveness. In more detail: is simple.are required: contribution to victory, unity, and decisiveness. In more detail: 1. To contribute to Ukraines victory, not to the illusion of negotiations Ukrainians never offer to fight in their place. They only ask not to interfere with defending themselves. And it is better to help with moral support, sanctions, weapons, and humanitarian initiatives. 2. To demonstrate the unity and solidarity of all democracies with Ukraine Nothing motivates Putin to escalate further than tensions between democracies and different countries. The survival of the worlds democracies is in jeopardy. Only through a comprehensive struggle can democracies thwart the predatory plans of bloodthirsty dictators. 3. Exemplify decisiveness, not hesitancy Alarming statements about saving Putins face and an impending nuclear attack encourage Russia to terrorize and intimidate free societies cynically. No matter how terrified we are, we must fight until the dictatorships are finally overthrown.\n\nAlyona Getmanchuk (Director of the New Europe Center) and Marianna Fakhurdinova (Research Fellow of the New Europe Center) contributed to the development of the arguments. New Europe Center is grateful to Ljudmyla Melnyk (Institute for European Politics (Institut fr Europische Politik), Berlin) and Dmytro Shulga (International Renaissance Foundation) for their valuable advice during the peer review process of the arguments for infographics.\n\nSergiy Solodkyy, First Deputy Director, New Europe Center (Ukraine)\n\nRead more:\n\nEdited by: Kate Ryabchiy",

Murat Cetinmuhurdar/PPO/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nISTANBUL, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Turkey is committed to seeking a peace dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, Turkish media cited President Tayyip Erdogan as saying on Saturday, as he accused the United States and other Western countries of provoking Moscow.\n\nState broadcaster TRT and other media quoted Erdogan as saying: \"The West, and especially the U.S., is attacking Russia seemingly endlessly,\" without elaborating on what he meant.\n\n\"Of course, Russia is displaying great resistance in the face of all this,\" Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters on a flight from Uzbekistan.\n\nWestern countries have armed Kyiv and provided other assistance and have also imposed stringent sanctions on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\n\"We are working on how to create a peace corridor here, like we had the grain corridor.

                "cc_text": "Foreign Affairs Council: Press remarks by High Representative Josep Borrell after the meeting\n\nCheck against delivery!\n\nGood afternoon, bonne aprs-midi,\n\nOn a eu un long Conseil [Affaires trangres]. On est au Conseil depuis 8:30 ce matin, a fait neuf heures [de runion].\n\nIt has been a long [Foreign Affairs] Council but a productive one. I am very happy about the result.\n\nFirst of all, because we reaffirmed our top priority. This top priority is to continue supporting Ukraine. I will leave for tomorrow the military aspects of this issue. Tomorrow, we have a Defence Ministers Council where we will continue discussing about what is happening in Ukraine from the defence and the military point of view. But certainly, the [Foreign] Ministers also talked about it.\n\nWe listened to Minister [of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro] Kuleba, who joined us [remotely] to debrief on the latest developments. We had the opportunity to reconfirm to him that the European Union stands with Ukraine until Ukraines victory. This has to be understood under Ukrainian parameters. Until then, we stay united in our support to Ukraine.\n\nA good proof of that is that today, we launched the EU Military Assistance Mission [to Ukraine (EUMAM)] with the purpose of training at least 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers. It has been decided, it has been agreed, it has been implemented in record time. It is the first time I see a Military Assistance Mission to go [ahead] as quickly as this one, through the whole procedure. I hope that, by the end of the month, it will start working.\n\nMember States discussed about the amount of our military support. More details will come tomorrow, but allow me to say that we should not confuse the 3.1 billion from the European Peace Facility, with the [combined] military support of the European Union and its Member States to Ukraine. Sometimes you can read some figures, a comparison between the United States effort and the European effort.\n\nI asked my military staff to do the best estimation of which is the amount of our military support to Ukraine, and I can advance a figure that tomorrow will be discussed with the Defence Ministers.\n\nI think I can say that at least 8 billion in military equipment have already been provided to Ukraine by the European Union and the Member States. It is about 45% of the effort done by the United States, so it is not negligible. We are not talking about 3.1 billion, but about 8 billion on military support.\n\nTomorrow, as I said, I will continue discussing these figures with the Defence Ministers and study how these resources have been implemented, with which kind of defence material, and its effectiveness.\n\nAll in all, our approach to Russia remains clear. We agreed with the Ministers on a common message along the following lines.\n\nFirst, we will continue isolating Russia internationally. We will continue imposing restrictive measures against [the] Russian economy. We stand ready to continue reinforcing restrictive measures and target third countries involvement, especially the ones who [we know] are providing arms and military support Iran and Belarus.\n\nThis morning, we discussed with the leader of Belarusian [United] Democratic Forces, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. We reconfirmed to her our solidarity with the people of Belarus, and we will continue upholding sanctions against Lukashenkos regime.\n\nAs I said, tomorrow I will go deeper into the military aspects of the situation.\n\nIt is clear that our sanctions are weakening the Russian economy. They weaken Russias capacity to buy and update technology. We never expected the sanctions were going to finish the war, but certainly, they are weakening the capacity of the Russian army to renew its material, especially in front of the enormous losses that Russia is suffering in the battlefield. It has weakened its capacity to lead a war based on terror against the Ukrainian people.\n\nPutins Russia wants to put Ukrainians into the darkness and the cold. They are destroying the electricity systems of this country: millions of Ukrainians do not have electricity. The purpose is, during the winter, to put them in inhumane situation in their cities.\n\nWe will continue supporting the Ukrainian people and ensure accountability for the violations of international law and war crimes committed in Ukraine. The news coming from the liberated cities are really important to know what has happened there. Together with the [European] Commission, we are looking at the options at our disposal to ensure accountability, and the discussion will continue on that.\n\nWe are working closely with our NATO partners and worldwide, [with] everybody who is ready to defend the international order based on rules.\n\nWe are enhancing our resilience, in particular on energy security and critical infrastructure, countering Russias hybrid threats, and information manipulation. We are supporting civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia. Our immediate support focuses on supporting Ukraine to resist Russias increased systematic targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.\n\nPutin is unable to conquer Ukraine. Putin is unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Putin is withdrawing. The Russian Army has withdrawn to the other side of the Dnipro River, and it is trying to compensate these military failures with efforts to increase the human suffering of the Ukrainian people especially now as the winter is approaching.\n\nAs I said, we are working with our partners to repair and replace Ukrainian energy infrastructure. This means an enormous effort.\n\nIn parallel, we are redoubling our efforts on outreach to third countries, in particular on the issue of food security. I want to mention that just today, we have published a joint statement with the United States Secretary of State, [Antony] Blinken, and the United Kingdom [Foreign] Secretary [James] Cleverly, and the High Representative of the European Union. The three of us going together with a public statement clarifying the issue of sanctions in relation to Russian food and fertilisers exports. Please, have a look at this communication from the three of us United States, United Kingdom and the European Union to clarify the conditions in which operators can participate in the exports of food and fertilisers from Russia.\n\nI want to stress that, on our side, thanks to the EU Solidarity Lanes, we have been able to support the export of 15 million tons of agrifood products between May and October [2022]. And, today, the Commission announced a new humanitarian aid package of 210 million for 15 countries around the world, especially from Africa, to Afghanistan, [and] Latin America, to address their immediate needs.\n\nNow, the international community needs to ensure the renewable and practical implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond the 19 November deadline. It is very important that this initiative brokered by the United Nations and Turkey could be implemented. But do not forget why this initiative has been taking place: it is not because a natural disaster, it is not because of a tsunami in the Black Sea, it is not because there were pirates. It is because the blockade of the Russian Army to the exports of Ukraine - using hunger as a weapon.\n\nRussia has no reasons, no legal ground to block food [from] going out from Ukraine to the international markets. What Russia has been doing is illegal and affecting first [of all] the lives of people from vulnerable countries around the world. Russia must stop weaponising food.\n\nThis is the strong message that the Foreign Affairs Council has issued today: Russia must stop weaponising food.\n\nBack to the Councils agenda, we discussed about the Great Lakes situation.\n\nYou know that the Great Lakes region in Africa is a hotspot, a geostrategic hotspot. This region can become a powerhouse for development of the entire African continent. It is a region of many challenges but also many opportunities.\n\nWe see there is strong potential we could achieve in such a region. It has potential which is very much unmatched. We can make a difference, be realistic in our ambition and focusing on sectors where we have a real added value.\n\nWe agreed on the need for a [renewed] strategy on the Great Lakes. It will be adopted in the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council to support the region, to move from tensions to trust, from trafficking to trade, and from competition to regional integration.\n\nBack to home, we are very worried about the situation in the Western Balkans. In the Western Balkans, several crises are looming, and partners feel the immediate damaging impact of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The shockwaves of this war are hitting the Western Balkans.\n\nTo counter that, we are stepping up our engagement as the Western Balkans remain our geostrategic priority - the closest and most important geostrategic priority. And I want to insist on the basic idea that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union. This is our message ahead of the next European Union - Western Balkans Summit on 6 December.\n\nDuring the weekend, I have been very busy in Paris discussing with Serbia and Kosovo. I briefed Ministers about my engagement as facilitator of the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue with Prime Minister [of Kosovo, Albin] Kurti and President [of Serbia, Aleksandar] Vui to defuse the unnecessary and counterproductive tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, to defuse these tensions that are reaching a very, very dangerous level.\n\nI can say that we are facing the most serious, the most dangerous crisis since 2013 of the last ten years. Both parties both parties - need to urgently show readiness to find a way forward to lower these tensions. It is not acceptable for either party to violate or ignore their Dialogue obligations.\n\nChief negotiators will start working here in Brussels on the next steps. They will start working tonight. The Kosovo side is already arriving tonight. I am ready to convene the leaders if negotiators manage to advance towards a practical solution on the issue of [licence] plates before the 21 November deadline. We cannot reach this date without having an agreement or we will be on the edge of a dangerous situation. You know, the withdrawal of the Serbs from the institutions, the dismissing of the police, of the judiciary, of the measures, has created a vacuum in the north of Kosovo. In this vacuum, the worst can happen. Both parties need to show more flexibility.\n\nThe message from the Council is clear: we need clear progress. We presented a proposal. I thank Germany and France for supporting strongly this proposal. Kosovo Serbs need to return to institutions. Kosovo authorities must show flexibility on licence plates and work on the implementation of the agreement on the Association/Community of Serb Majority Municipalities without delay.\n\nWith partners aspiring for a European future, we expect a European behaviour. We expect willingness to find European solutions: this is a basic precondition. They are at a crossroads now. They have to decide which way they want to go: towards the European Union or towards the past.\n\nWe also focused on the hybrid threats directed at the region and agreed to step up our work and support our partners on cyber-defence. We have condemned the important attacks that Albania has been suffering and also strongly condemn the cyber-attack that hit Montenegros IT infrastructure during the month of August. We will be looking for more support for Montenegro to face this.\n\nAfter spending quite a lot of time discussing about the situation in the Western Balkans, we raised the situation in Lebanon and the deepening political vacuum that could bring it to an economic collapse.\n\nOnce again, it is crucial for Lebanon to urgently conclude Presidential elections to unlock these long-overdue economic reforms and get international support. We did not rule out any option to unblock the current political stalemate, including possible sanctions.\n\nFinally, let me stop this long explanation: we discussed about Iran and the unabated repressive reaction of the authorities to the public discontent, showed by courageous demonstrators in the streets of the cities of Iran. In particular, we salute the bravery of the Iranian women who continue demanding basic respect of their fundamental rights.\n\nTo support them, today the Council adopted another 31 listings under the Iran Human Rights Regime.\n\nWe also insist on Iran to stop providing arms that Russia is using to commit atrocities against the Ukrainian people. The drones provided by Iran to Russia allegedly months ago, [before] the war started, are being used in this war and it is a clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231. We have already adopted sanctions in this regard weeks ago and we will take further steps if needed.\n\nFinally, I have to stress that we see a backlash against gender equality and womens rights globally not only in Iran. For example, the Taliban just announced a further restrictions on womens freedom of movement, barring women from entering public parks and gyms. We strongly condemn this.\n\nWe set out today our clear and strong position to apply efforts to counter this global trend against women, in the conclusions on Women, Peace and Security that the Council has adopted.\n\nI personally had the occasion to meet with groups of Afghan women who escaped from Afghanistan during the days of the evacuation of Kabul, and of knowing better from them of the very sad situation of the women in Afghanistan. Lets not forget them.\n\nThis is, more or less, what we have been discussing along these nine hours: Russia and Ukraine, Kherson withdrawal, EU Military Assistance Mission, military support, Western Balkans, Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, Belarus, Lebanon, Irans human rights violations.\n\nI remain at your disposal.\n\nQ&A\n\nQ. Mr Borrell, I am very impressed by your support to Ukraine, because it is a very big support that you will accept 15,000 soldiers and officers to train them. My question is on your diplomatic dealing. After the removal of Russian forces from Kherson city, Ukraine feels the soft pressure of United States and Turkey to start negotiations with Russia. What is your position the position of the EU? Because Ukraine has a separate position, not the same as the United States to start the negotiations and to resolve the problems, the conflict and war with diplomatic meanings. We hear the same rhetoric from Ankara, from Turkey. What is the official position of Brussels?\n\nLook, I am not representing Ankara here. I am not representing the US, neither. I am representing my colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Council. Je pense que je me suis bien exprim avant, je vais rpter la phrase: we will continue supporting Ukraine until Ukraine's victory, and it has to be understood under Ukrainian parameters.\n\nQ. Deux questions, si je peux. La premire est lie lUkraine et lIran. On a entendu ce matin le nouveau ministre des affaires trangres sudois [Tobias Billstrm] dire que le support soutien lUkraine doit venir avant tout. Cest une question lie laccord sur le nuclaire, donc je vous demande si les fournitures darmes de lIran la Russie peuvent, en quelque sorte, avoir un impact direct sur le JCPOA? Deuxime question: dans votre introduction, vous navez pas mentionn limmigration. On nous a dit que le ministre italien [des affaires trangres, Antonio Tajani] avait demand discuter de ce point aujourdhui. Je voulais savoir si vous en avez discut et avec quel rsultat ventuellement.\n\nLook, they are different issues. The JCPOA is a tasking of the United Nations Security Council, I am acting as Coordinator of the negotiations in order to review a deal to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear. It is following its path with a lot of difficulties and stalemates, it is still there. Lets see what is happening. It has nothing to do with other issues, which certainly concern us. I have made a reference to sanctions for human rights abuses, women, demonstrators; I expressed also my concern about the supply of arms from Iran to Russia it is clear that Iranian drones have been used, there is a lot of evidence. There is speculation about the possibility of using [Iranian] ballistic missiles but there is no evidence at least not yet of the use and supply of this type of arms. But I want to make a difference: I will continue trying to work in order to fulfil all the balances between the parts engaged in negotiating the JCPOA and, at the same time, we will act as we are acting on other frontlines like the ones we have taken today.\n\nMigration, yes, certainly, we discussed about migration. It was not a specific point in the agenda but, how can we [not]? We should talk about migration: some events in the Mediterranean make it unavoidable. Yes, [there] has been an exchange of views and we will have to continue discussing about it. But, today, nothing concrete.\n\nQ. Can you tell me more about this military assistance mission for Ukraine? Where will it take place only in Poland or also in other countries? At what stage are the negotiations on 18 billion of aids for Ukraine now? Because I know that Hungary does not support this aid for Ukraine.\n\nThank you for very precise questions. It is easier to answer when the questions are focusing on specific issues. Yes, we are going to train 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers, not all of them in Poland. It will be several different Member States that will provide the basis, not only training, not only material, not only trainees, but concrete places in which this training will take place. I can tell you that the country that I know best will also participate in the training of these soldiers on their soil. So, several Member States will be participating, and the training will take place in several different member states, not only in Poland.\n\nSecondly, as far as I understood, the country you mentioned is not opposing to the macro-financial assistance of 18 billion to Ukraine. Only the discussion is about how to implement it; through common debt or by bilateral agreements? But the principle of providing a macro-financial assistance to Ukraine has been agreed unanimously.\n\nQ. You said that the European proposal for more structural relations and a way out of the current crisis is on the table. I know it is sensitive, but could you be any more specific about the key elements of this proposal? So, what do you want the partners to agree on? Is there a timeframe in which you would like those discussions to come to any result? Secondly, if I may, you said also previously that Kosovo should align its actions on licence plates with past Dialogue agreements: does that mean that Pristina is in violation of previous agreements on car plates? Would you expect them to prolong, for example, the validity of so-called status neutral car plates?\n\nWhat I wanted to say, let me be careful with the words, is that everybody has to agree with past agreements. It does not make sense to work on new agreements if the agreements that were accepted in the past are not being implemented. And certainly, there is the issue of the [licence] plates, of the identity cards - for which Serbia made a step forward during the summer. There is the issue of the Association/Community] of the Serb Municipalities. I am not going to make the list of the issues on which I am asking for flexibility and commitment.\n\nAnd the proposal that we presented, and now I am happy to say that France and Germany have been very much supportive of this proposal. The so-called \"Franco-German proposal\" is in fact the Franco-German support for the proposal presented by me and [the EU Special Representative for the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue] Miroslav Lajk. It is a proposal, lets say, European proposal that tries to go out of the crisis management mode.\n\nIn the last two, three years, I have been permanently in crisis management, from one crisis to another, solving yesterdays crisis and waiting for tomorrows crisis, be it [licence] plates, be it whatever. This is not the way you are solving the problem. You have to look for a more structural approach, looking at the deep questions, and try to prevent the crises from happening. And well, this is a step forward, this is a new approach, and I have to say that both parties were, I would not say agreeing, but not rejecting the proposal, not rejecting which is already a lot. But now again, we are in crisis mode, and we have to solve this crisis of the next week, before the next week a crisis has to be avoided. And my hope is that if we manage to avoid a big clash now that there is no police in the north of Kosovo, now that there is no judiciary, that there is a vacuum of institutions. If we are able to overcome this very dangerous moment, then we should be able to look at the problem with different lenses, not of crisis management but of structural solutions. And I think it is possible, and the European path requires that. I cannot go into the details. It has two pages, no more than that, but that could represent a compass, for looking for a solution which does not depend on everyday crisis.\n\nQ. Going back to the Iranian sanctions' discussion, the German Foreign Minister [Annalena Baerbock], on her way into the meeting, was talking about the idea of listing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation by the EU. Is this something that could be a next step as you have alluded to, or this completely off the table?\n\nWell, on the table this issue has not been discussed, but let me be concrete. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps is already listed. It is already listed under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime and, also, in the latest listing on human rights violations. I do not know what kind of listing my colleague was mentioning, but you should know that this Revolutionary Guard is already listed under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime. We have different sanctions regime: \"listed\" does not mean anything unless you tell me which kind of sanctions regime you are implementing. It is also included in the latest listing for human rights violations.\n\nThe addition of an organisation in the so-called European Union terrorists list is subject to a Council decision and regulation that has to be adopted by unanimity. Under European Union law because we are [in] a state of law, we are being governed by law for anything under our law, the prerequisite for listing an organisation on the terrorists list is a national decision first, that has to be adopted by the competent national authorities on the basis of a court decision, on the basis of a judiciary decision, or a proscription order by an administrative authority at the national level. It means that at the European Union level, alone, [we] cannot act without such a national decision that has to be based on something supported by an administrative decision or a judiciary decision. It is the way we work: I cannot say tomorrow in the morning, \"ah, you are a terrorist organisation\" - no. Things require procedures and require legal procedures.\n\nQ. Je vous poserai le mois prochain la question sur la nouvelle Stratgie pour les Grands Lacs. Entre temps, sur la guerre en Ukraine: vous soulignez donc la faon dont les Vingt-Sept ont ritr leur soutien lUkraine jusqu la victoire et selon les paramtres fixs par lUkraine. Ma question est celle-ci: est-ce que, selon votre comprhension, selon la comprhension des Vingt-Sept, ces paramtres impliquent la reconqute des territoires perdus depuis 2014 et pas seulement depuis le 24 fvrier 2022? Et si c'est le cas, est-ce que vous sentez un soutien unanime des Vingt-Sept pour cette entreprise, ce but ?\n\nNo, I have not gone as far as you pretend. I said that it is up to the Ukrainians to decide what does it mean for them: \"victory\"- is up to them. The country which has been destroyed is Ukraine. The people frozen are Ukrainians. The 7 million people that fled Ukraine are Ukrainians. The casualties are Ukrainians, so let Ukrainians decide. I think it is quite logical. How can I say to the Ukrainians what they have to do? The only thing I can tell them is: \"we will support you\".\n\nEt demain, on va discuter, avec les ministres de la Dfense, plus en dtails des questions militaires. Mais cest vident quen se retirant de Kherson, larme russe a subi dj une dfaite trs grave: elle sest retire sans combattre, peut-tre pour viter le pire. Il faut quand mme savoir que la capacit de nuisance dont Moscou dispose est encore trs importante, mais elle ne lutilise [non] pas pour se battre militairement, mais pour dtruire les infrastructures critiques [de lUkraine]. Et mme si les dfenses anti-ariennes sont capables dintercepter les drones avec une remarquable efficacit, cest vident que la Russie de Poutine est embarque dans la volont [de vouloir] dtruire un pays. Donc je pense que si on veut viter de penser la reconstruction, il faut viter la destruction. Si vous voulez viter davoir reconstruire, vitez la destruction. Now. This is the key for me.\n\nWhich are the Ukrainian parameters, the Ukrainians will decide.\n\nLink to the video: https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-233001",

                "cc_text": "Putin does not have much to lose from engaging in peace negotiations, but Zelenskyy does.\n\nAs Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu announced his armys withdrawal from the key Ukrainian city of Kherson, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it creates a window of opportunity for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussias full-scale invasion of its neighbour has already lasted for more than eight months, and casualties and destruction have mounted day after day. Milley said more than 100,000 Russian soldiers may have been killed and wounded in this war while Ukraine \"probably\" suffered a similar number of casualties.\n\nTo stress his point about peace, Milley evoked the great powers failure to negotiate at an earlier stage in World War I a mistake that led to millions more casualties and catastrophic developments in several countries, notably the Russian Empire.\n\nMilleys remarks represent a change of tack in the official US rhetoric, raising questions about a possible push for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. What is more, in the weeks preceding the Russian withdrawal from Kherson, the United States and Russia resumed communication about Ukraine at the level of top security officials.\n\nBut are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin willing to negotiate? And how would opening a dialogue reflect on their governments?\n\nUkraine demands a full withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory, reparations and punishment for war criminals. Zelenskyy himself has signed a decree which unequivocally bans him from talking to Putin. Kyivs official position effectively amounts to a demand for regime change in Russia as a condition for talks.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has long dropped its earlier goal of removing the Ukrainian government and has officially asserted that it is ready for talks with no conditions.\n\nFrom the Ukrainian perspective, negotiations are a way for Russia to buy time at the moment when the Ukrainian army has seized the initiative on the frontline and has liberated swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nBut Zelenskyys government is reportedly under pressure from Washington to soften its uncompromising stance. Likely reacting to these signals, the Ukrainian president said in a recent interview with CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour that he was \"ready to talk to Russia but with a different Russia, one that is truly ready for peace\".\n\nMeanwhile, on social media, Zelenskyys security adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak has been reiterating that the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory is unattainable while Putin remains in power. \"Therefore, we are constructive in our assessment: We will talk with the next leader of RF,\" he wrote in a recent tweet, referring to the Russian Federation.\n\nIt is hard to say whether Kyivs \"all or nothing\" rhetoric derives from a deep conviction that it is going to prevail or if it is just posturing to mobilise people in the face of aggression and avoid signalling weakness to the adversary.\n\nWhile Ukraine has not exhausted its offensive potential, it is doubtful it can sustain a war of attrition with its more powerful neighbour in the long run, even with all the military and financial support it gets from the West.\n\nThe country is expected to lose 35 percent of its GDP by the end of the year, while Russia will see its economy shrink by 4.5 percent, according to the World Bank. Russias missile and drone attacks this fall have destroyed up to 40 percent of the countrys energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy recently admitted.\n\nIf the air strikes continue, many Soviet-era apartment blocks, in which most Ukrainians reside, will become unlivable because they depend on central heating provided by thermal plants. This could create a wave of refugees that the European Union would not be able to accommodate. Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has mentioned the possibility of evacuating 3 million people from Ukraines capital alone.\n\nRussia is yet to deploy most of the 300,000 men it claims to have mobilised since September. It is also buying more drones and high-precision missiles from Iran, while ramping up its own production. While withdrawing from Kherson, it is slowly restarting offensive operations in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe moment when Ukraine appears to be the prevailing side is also the moment when it can make maximum gains in peace talks. If Russia seizes the initiative on the front line again, its appetite for territorial and political trophies will rise exponentially.\n\nRussias departure from Kherson and Washingtons subsequent softening of tone on the possibility of talks provides the vague contours of what a future settlement may look like.\n\nBy withdrawing from the right bank of the Dnipro River, Moscow abandons the hope of seizing Odesa and turning Ukraine into a landlocked country at least for now.\n\nBut seizing Odesa extends far beyond Russias territorial claims over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. After a sham \"referendum\" in September, Russia also officially annexed the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, but it left itself room for manoeuvre by not defining their borders. After withdrawing from the city of Kherson, Moscow still controls most of the Kherson region.\n\nFor Putin to be able to declare victory, it is sufficient to hold onto the territory Russia is already occupying. He can even afford to lose some more. Russias conformist majority has never shown any serious appetite for territorial expansion or has bothered about which bits of Ukrainian territory their country will control once peace is restored.\n\nPutins war in Ukraine is more of a punitive operation than an imperialist land grab. As long as the outcome of the war is more humiliating for Ukraine than the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which Moscow tried to impose on Kyiv in the run-up to the full-scale invasion in February, Putin will feel vindicated. The implementation would have resulted in the emergence of an autonomous Donbas region in eastern Ukraine effectively controlled by Russia and would have prevented Ukraines NATO membership.\n\nConflict with the US-led West, as the Kremlin frames the war in Ukraine, is now the main source of legitimacy for Putins government, which is why it launched the aggression in the first place. Losing some of the occupied territory will not necessarily undermine the government. On the contrary, it may lead to more people rallying behind the leader in the face of what many Russians perceive as an existential threat.\n\nMeanwhile, the West appears to be both unable and unwilling to reach out to the Russian population with a vision of a better future without Putin. For many politicians, Russia is little more than a convenient enemy. That makes it easier for Putin to maintain power.\n\nZelenskyy, on the other hand, is on a mission to deliver on maximalist expectations while also facing belligerent opposition which is scrutinising his every move, ready to accuse him of betraying Ukraines interests.\n\nHe must prove that Ukrainians enormous sacrifices were not in vain and they have gained something tangible by refusing to succumb to Russian pressure to implement the Minsk agreements. That will be much harder to achieve, which is why Kyiv is trying to regain as much territory as possible and keep up its momentum.\n\nThe trick is figuring out the right time to draw a line and sue for peace.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeeras editorial stance.",

Russia's war only enhances the urgency of the need to transition the world off its dependence on fossil fuels,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his arrival, Bidens administration sought to set the stage by unveiling a domestic plan to crack down hard on the US oil and gas industrys emissions of methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, in a move that defied months of lobbying by drillers.\n\nWashington and the EU were also planning to issue a joint declaration on Friday pledging more action on oil industry methane, building on an international deal launched last year and since signed by 119 nations to cut economy-wide emissions 30% this decade.\n\nSkepticism\n\nThe announcements come under a cloud of skepticism that world governments are doing enough to address warming.\n\nA United Nations report released last week showed global emissions on track to rise 10.6% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels, even as devastating storms, droughts, wildfires and floods are already inflict billions of dollars in damage worldwide.\n\nScientists say emissions must instead drop 43% by that time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures as targeted by the Paris Agreement of 2015 the threshold above which climate change risks start spinning out of control.\n\nMany countries, including the United States and members of the European Union, are also calling for increased supply of fossil fuels in the near-term to help bring down consumer energy prices that have spiked since Russias war on Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "Mail-in ballots were sorted for processing at the Maricopa County Elections Center in Phoenix on Tuesday.\n\nFor months, election officials have worried that activists convinced that the election system is corrupt and broken would cause significant problems in the midterms. But the scattered episodes during the vote did not disrupt the system.\n\nThe relative calm so far had election officials breathing a sigh of relief, even as they remained concerned about specious legal challenges and misinformation that could erupt in the coming weeks. They praised tactics they believe reinforced a system that was rocked by the baseless claims of fraud and widespread distrust after Donald J. Trumps attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThey pointed to better and more frequent communication by elections officials, and transparency measures such as live cams at ballot boxes and in counting rooms. Some speculated that polling and right-wing media reports promising a Republican blowout in races across the country may have discouraged some right-wing activists from provocations at polling places.\n\n\"It was remarkably smooth,\" said Damon Circosta, the chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Elections. \"You can tell by my giddiness I was not expecting that.\"\n\nOver the past two years, a movement of conspiracy-theory-minded activists has loudly questioned and undermined the countrys electoral system. Their efforts have found backing from conservative organizations, deep-pocketed supporters and right-wing media influencers and created concerns about the potential for violence, intimidation and vigilantism on Election Day.\n\nBut the incidents reported by officials this week were far less stark. Despite widespread accusations of fraud, Republican candidates so far have mostly accepted the results when theyve lost including some of the loudest promoters of election conspiracy theories. Mr. Trumps calls for \"Protest!\" in response to relatively routine technical problems in Arizona and Michigan have so far been largely ignored.\n\nEarly signs indicate that turnout was relatively high, particularly in battleground states, suggesting that voters were not deterred by the noise.\n\nDozens of races are still undecided and counting could continue into next week in a few places. Two states in particular, Nevada and Arizona, feature several election-denying candidates in tight races and elections lawyers say they are gearing up for legal challenges aiming to once again put the soundness of the system on trial.\n\nOn Thursday, Mark Finchem, the Republican candidate for secretary of state in Arizona, disparaged the election system in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, and compared one part of the process to the notorious hanging chads of the 2000 election in Florida.\n\nImage A storage warehouse for DeKalb Countys elections office in Decatur, Ga.

Nic Antaya for The New York Times\n\nThere were serious stresses for elections officials and others working to protect voting.\n\nUp until the moment polls closed, election administrators were still getting calls with claims about supposed flaws in the voting equipment, while poll monitors in some precincts hounded elections workers with questions about the machinery. In a few cases, people tried to disrupt voting or prevent voters from casting ballots. And technical glitches in multiple jurisdictions were seized on by Republican candidates, election deniers, right-wing influencers and Mr. Trump. Such misinformation is bound to further damage the confidence of at least some portions of the public.\n\nIn some places, clerks and monitoring groups say they are still concerned that election deniers on boards charged with certifying the vote could try to disrupt the process.\n\n\"There are definitely still things for us to be concerned about,\" said Orion Danjuma, a lawyer for Protect Democracy, an elections integrity group. Last month he helped the group file successful legal challenges to self-appointed vigilantes who patrolled ballot drop boxes in Maricopa County, at times carrying long guns and wearing body armor.\n\nImage Watching the processing of absentee voter ballots in Detroit. Credit... Nic Antaya for The New York Times\n\nImage Ballot adjudication underway in Decatur, Ga. Credit... Nicole Craine for The New York Times\n\nHe said the victory in Arizona might have been enough of a shot across the bow to stop some activists, but emphasized that the most serious attacks on elections didnt emerge until weeks and months after the 2020 election, when lawyers for Mr. Trump repeatedly sought to reverse the outcome. \"Were poised to be ready for more lawsuits,\" Mr. Danjuma said.\n\nIndeed, Kelli Ward, chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, vowed to pursue such actions. \"We have been preparing for this for over a year,\" she said in a tweet on Thursday. \"We have a huge team of lawyers ready to take action if needed.\"\n\nRegardless of Tuesdays results, voices pushing election conspiracy theories are unlikely to be muted anytime soon. On Wednesday morning, the organizer of a coalition of election deniers in Michigan urged the group to redouble its forces despite the fact that Democrats swept nearly every major race in the state.\n\n\"We can choose to curl up on the ledge and succumb, or we can dust ourselves off and restart the arduous climb up the steep slopes\" of election integrity, wrote Patrice Johnson, the organizer of Michigan Fair Elections in a blog post. The groups next online meeting was scheduled for Thursday.\n\nOne of Michigan Fair Elections preferred candidates, Kristina Karamo, running for secretary of state, has not conceded despite losing by 14 percentage points and on Thursday afternoon sent out a list of supposed electoral \"violations,\" saying there was more to come.\n\nBut the Republican candidates for Michigan governor and attorney general both acknowledged defeat on Wednesday, as did Tim Michels, the Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin, who campaigned on a promise to change the voting system so that Republicans never lost elections again in the state.\n\nConcessions by candidates who spread unfounded theories of voting fraud are critical to ensure the stability of the election system, elections experts say. In addition, they note public outreach from election officials can help put out fires.\n\nAfter receiving calls and emails from voters demanding that their ballots be counted by hand rather than on machines, which many activists falsely believe can be manipulated, Fred Sherman, the election chief in Johnson County, Kan., came up with a solution. Voters who raised that question in the district, Kansas most populous, would be given the option to place their ballot in a specially marked white envelope in a sealed red ballot bag and were given assurances that they would be hand counted.\n\nAbout 300 of the 250,000 people who cast ballots in Johnson County used the red bags, Mr. Sherman said, and it appeared to solve the issue.\n\nImage Volunteers wheeling voting machines and results into NRG Arena in Houston. Credit... Annie Mulligan for The New York Times\n\nImage Processing mail-in ballots on Election Day in Phoenix. Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\n\n\"They obviously created a little bit of turbulence,\" Mr. Sherman said. \"Its like running a treadmill always on incline.\" Mr. Sherman said hed like \"an easy run and you dont have that when you have constant election denial.\"\n\nAccording to Douglas Wilson, a Democratic strategist in Charlotte, N.C., polling predicting a large Republican wave may have also worked to cool the ardor of election deniers. Under that logic, he said, attempts to undermine faith in the results would only have discouraged Republican voters.\n\n\"Republican friends kept telling me every day Democrats were going to be wiped out,\" said Mr. Wilson.\n\nSpurred by concerns about election deniers, numerous voting rights groups began their own preparations well ahead of Tuesday.\n\nOne coalition, called Election Defenders, organized dozens of sessions to train people posted at polling places to help prevent voter intimidation. Its goal was to recruit 1,250 volunteers, but instead was overwhelmed with more than 2,000 people who completed several hours of online training on how to intervene in tense situations, dispel confusion, de-escalate confrontations with potentially armed activists and, more than anything, keep things calm.\n\n\"We had the good problem of more people signing up than we had a place to put them,\" said Tiffany Flowers, a lead organizer of the campaign. She said she worked 20 hours on Tuesday monitoring social media and checking in with partners around the country.\n\nOne of the few incidents came in late from Maricopa County, involving a man who tried to physically prevent a woman from entering a voting center minutes before it was set to close. Ms. Flowers said several Election Defenders on hand stepped up and escorted the woman in, then waited outside to walk her back to her car afterward.\n\n\"I strongly believe that there are more Americans who wanted to see everyone who was eligible to vote be able to vote fairly, freely and with dignity,\" Ms. Flowers said.\n\nNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n\n12:57 P.M. EST\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Good afternoon, everybody.\n\nQ Good afternoon.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. So, this afternoon at Howard University, the President will thank will thank staff, volunteers, and everyone who helped ensure everyone could make their voices heard in the midterm election.\n\nAs you heard him say yesterday the President, \"With their vo-\" \"With their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are.\"\n\nAnd while we dont know all the results just yet, we do know that states across the country saw record voter turnout, and voters also spoke clearly about their concerns from fighting inflation to addressing crime to protecting our democracy and the right to choose. These are issues the President has been laser-focused on from day one, and remain top and it will remain top priorities for him.\n\nAnd as he said yesterday as well, no matter what the final tally in all these races will be, he is prepared to work across the aisle to deliver for the American people. Thats what people want, and thats what the American people deserve.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to my colleague, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who is going to talk through the Presidents upcoming travels.\n\nJake?\n\nQ Are you all right? Whats happened to you?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Its been a long couple of days, my friend. (Laughter.)\n\nGo ahead, Jake.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Good afternoon, everyone. Ill take a few minutes to walk through the trip over the next several days, and then Ill be happy to take your questions. And I would just ask for your patience, because theres quite a bit to get through, given an action-packed schedule that the President has across three stops over a week.\n\nBefore I get into the Presidents travel across North Africa and Asia, I want to provide a brief update on our efforts to ensure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.\n\nToday, the United States will be announcing another package of security assistance for Ukraine, including important air defense contributions like missiles for HAWK air defense systems, as well as four U.S. Avenger air defense systems that come equipped with Stinger missiles.\n\nThis equipment will complement other air defense contributions announced by our allies and partners in the context of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that Secretary Austin chairs.\n\nWhen I was in Kyiv last week, I had the chance to consult directly with President Zelenskyy and his team on the ground about what Ukraine needs to be in the strongest position possible on the battlefield. This increased air defense will be critical for Ukraine as Russia continues to use cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones to attack critical civilian infrastructure.\n\nWith that, let me turn to the trip.\n\nAs you all know, tonight, the President departs for Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where tomorrow he will participate in the COP27 climate conference and hold a bilateral meeting with President Al Sisi.\n\nThe President heads to COP27 with historic momentum on climate, thanks to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and other significant steps that put us on an enduring path towards meeting our ambitions and clean energy goals.\n\nWhile hes on the ground, hell speak to his personal commitment to addressing the climate crisis. Hell highlight some of the progress the United States has made both here at home and in rallying action on climate around the world. And hell underscore the need to go further, faster, to help the most vulnerable communities build their resilience without losing sight of the need for the world, and particularly for the major economies, to cut emissions dramatically in this decisive decade.\n\nWhile in Egypt, President Biden will also meet with President Al Sisi, as I mentioned, to discuss a number of critical regional and bilateral issues, following on his visit to the Middle East earlier this year, where he also had an opportunity to sit with President Al Sisi.\n\nOn Saturday, hell arrive in Cambodia and attend the U.S.-ASEAN Summit. Hell reaffirm the United States strong support for ASEAN centrality and build on the achievements of the historic U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit that was held in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. He will also hold a bilateral meeting with 2022 ASEAN Chair, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen.\n\nOn Sunday in Cambodia, he will participate in the East Asia Summit. He will underscore U.S. support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture in the Indo-Pacific and discuss opportunities to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific that is more connected, more prosperous, more secure, and more resilient.\n\nHell also hold bilateral and trilateral meetings with the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of Korea in light of the continuing nuclear and missile threats posed by the DPRK, as well as growing alignment among our countries in promoting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn Monday, President Biden will be in Bali, Indonesia, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. He will thank President Widodo for his leadership, his chairmanship of the G20, and highlight the growing importance of the U.S.-India [sic] Strategic U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership.\n\nLater in the day on Monday, President Biden will hold a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. This is the first time that President Biden and President Xi will have had this is the first time that they will meet face-to-face since President Biden became President.\n\nPresident Biden has made it a priority to keep lines of communication open with President Xi to responsibly manage the competition between our two countries, and he believes there is no more important channel than that between the leaders of the United States and China.\n\nFrom day one of the Biden administration, our approach to the PRC has followed the same fundamentals: invest in the foundations of our strength here at home; align our efforts with a network of allies and partners; and compete responsibly to defend and advance our interests and those of like-minded nations.\n\nThe meeting between President Biden and President Xi will be an in-depth and substantive opportunity to better understand one anothers priorities and intentions, to address differences, and to identify areas where we can work together, because working together to address common problems is in our interest and because it is what the world expects of responsible powers.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will attend the G20 Summit where hell focus on a range of pressing global economic challenges, especially for emerging and vulnerable economies, including energy security and the clean energy transition, food security, debt relief for low- and middle-income countries, multilateral development bank reform, and the launch of a pandemic preparedness fund.\n\nHe will also rally likeminded nations to speak out forcefully against Russias illegal invasion in and illegal war in Ukraine, which has exacerbated many of these challenges.\n\nPresident Biden will join with fellow G7 and G20 leaders to host an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, PGII, where the U.S. and other partners will announce a series of high-impact infrastructure projects across the developing world.\n\nThe President will have the opportunity to hold a number of other bilateral meetings on the margins of the G20, and well announce those in due course. Among others, we expect that hell have the chance to sit for the first time with the prime ministers of both the United Kingdom and Italy the new prime ministers who have both recently taken office.\n\nThis trip comes at an important moment. President Biden heads off with the wind at his back. The United States has helped rally the world to oppose Russian aggression in Ukraine. We have built a strong foundation of engagement with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. We have launched impactful new initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, including PGII and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Were leading collective efforts on climate, health, food and energy security. And weve made far-reaching foundational investments in our industrial and innovation base and in modernizing our infrastructure here at home.\n\nSo we believe that we are in a strong position to both navigate competition and to work with partners to solve the great challenges of our time. Thats what President Biden intends to do on this trip.\n\nAnd thank you all for your patience, and I look forward to answering your questions.\n\nYes.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. In the briefing we had earlier about the Xi meeting, there was a mention of some proposals on areas where there could be some collaboration. Was that specifically regarding tariffs and trade negotiations? And will there be any progress on that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I dont think you should look at this meeting as one in which theres going to be specific deliverables announced. Rather, the two leaders are going to give direction to their teams to work on a number of areas, both areas where we have differences and areas where we can work together. That will include direction to the economic teams to address our concerns about Chinese economic practices and to deal with some of the underlying differences of view and perspective on economic matters.\n\nIt will also involve giving direction to try to work on issues on which we do have common interest, whether its health, counternarcotics, climate, or other areas.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ So, a two-part question on the Asia trip. First off, what impact does the midterm elections have on the Presidents ability to deliver on, you know, American commitments overseas? And, secondly, now that Xi is through the congress in China, does that affect his willingness to work with the United States or embolden him to, you know, conflict with the United States more? What impact do you think that could have?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, when it comes to the President leaving after the results on Tuesday and the incoming results that continue to flow in, he feels very good about where things stand, and he feels like he is going out on this trip with the wind very much at his back. And that gives him an excellent opportunity both to deal with competitors from a strong position and to rally allies.\n\nAnd as far as the continuing support of the United States for critical foreign policy initiatives, the President was clear yesterday, and he will be very clear on the trip, that there will be strong, enduring, unflagging, unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russias aggression.\n\nThere is a bipartisan basis and foundation to our approach to China. And he looks forward to working with both parties on that issue, whatever the final composition of the two houses of Congress are.\n\nBut in general, he goes out on this trip feeling like the results from Tuesday show that the American people,\n\nyou know, are sending him out onto the world stage in a very strong position.\n\nQ And on the China issue, what impact does the you know, Xis new term in the Communist Congress what impact does that have on their willingness to work with the U.S., do you think?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: That remains to be seen. And part of what the President is eager to determine is: In a face-to-face meeting where for the first time since hes come into office, President Biden has come into the presidency, he will get to sit in the same room with Xi Jinping, be direct and straightforward with him as he always is, and expect the same in return from Xi. And then he can make his judgments on that basis about how to take things forward.\n\nThats why this meeting is extremely important. There just is no substitute for this kind of leader-to-leader communication in navigating and managing such a consequential relationship.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Jake, thanks so much for doing the briefing. I want to ask you about Brittney Griner and then President Putin more broadly. But shes been moved to a penal colony and apparently hasnt been seen for six days. What can you tell us about her condition? When is the last time that U.S. officials had any kind of update on her condition?\n\nAnd what is your level of optimism that now that we are past the midterms, President Putin will be more potentially serious about negotiating her release?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So I have to protect the confidentiality of our dealings with her family and some of our consular dealings with Russian officials. But I will tell you, on a daily basis, our embassy in Moscow is focused on ensuring that Brit- they are on top of Brittney Griners condition, location, and how the Russian government is treating her.\n\nShe is being held unjustly. She should be released immediately. We have made that clear to our Russian counterparts. And we have put forward a series of proposals over the last several months for how we could resolve her case, as well as the case of Paul Whelan, to bring them both home. So far, the Russians have not shown a willingness to engage in in that back-and-forth to produce a result.\n\nAs President Biden said yesterday, we are hopeful that we can renew that dialogue and find a way to get these cases resolved and to get both Brittney and Paul home.\n\nI cant handicap it. I cant give you any predictions. All I can tell you is President Biden is personally engaged on this. I am personally engaged on this. We are dealing with the Russians at very senior levels, and our diplomats on the ground are working overtime to ensure that they are staying in close touch with their Russian counterparts on her case.\n\nQ And I know President Biden got a version of this yesterday, but if you could just help us understand this moment right now and what it means. The fact that Russia has pulled out of Kherson, is the U.S. encouraging Ukraine to now start peace talks with Russia? Is there any sense that that might actually happen? And does it lower your concern or does it impact your concerned at all about Putins potential use of a nuclear weapon?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, this is a significant military milestone for the Ukrainians if, in fact, it happens that Russia follows through and withdraws to the far side of the Dnieper River. Of course, were going to watch actions, and not just announcements, to see what actually unfolds.\n\nBut if this does come to pass, that will mean in the Battle of Kyiv, in the Battle of Kherson, in the Battle of Kharkiv, the Ukrainians will have prevailed against an invading marauding force that conducted an illegal war in their country.\n\nBut, of course, its not the end of the war. As Russia continues to occupy parts of Ukrainian territory, we are continuing to support the Ukrainians in their effort to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAnd as the President said yesterday, were guided by a very simple principle: \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" It is ultimately up to Ukraine to make determinations about its diplomatic course. It is our job to put them in the best position on the battlefield so that when and if there is an opportunity for diplomacy, theyre in the best position at the bargaining table. I dont have anything to offer you today about the likelihood or the proximity of any kind of negotiations.\n\nRight now, what the Ukrainians are focused on is defending their critical infrastructure against these barbaric attacks that are killing civilians and harming, you know, the basic functioning of the economy, and trying to take their territory back.\n\nThe United States is not pressuring Ukraine. Were not insisting on things with Ukraine. What we are doing is consulting as partners and showing our support not just through public statements or moral support, but through the tangible, physical support of the kind of military assistance I mentioned before.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Just a quick follow-up on Kherson, first. You said that youd be watching actions instead of just hearing what theyre saying. Do you have any indication that a withdrawal has actually started?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We do see some indications of movement consistent with what the announcements were yesterday. But this is an involved operation. The Russians had flowed a significant number of forces and personnel into Kherson city and to the west side of the Dnieper River. So its not the kind of thing you just snap your fingers and its done. So we will want to see how it actually unfolds in the coming days before we make any judgments about whether the Russians are fully fully following through on the announcement they made, or whether theyre going to choose to change course at some point. And well continue to stay in close touch with the Ukrainians on that as well.\n\nQ And to follow up on Kristens questions about Griner forgive me if Im wrong, but I didnt hear whether you have a condition for her a current condition, how shes doing since shes been transferred to the colony.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Sorry, at the start of my answer to Kristen, what I said is, to protect confidentiality, Im not going to speak to her condition from the podium today.\n\nQ And I have one more question, unrelated. Sorry.\n\nThe President yesterday said that it should be that Elon Musks acquisition of Twitter should be looked into as a potential threat to national security. Can you offer anything about why? And he also said there are many ways to look into that. How would you look into that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, you heard the President yesterday, and the CFIUS process is the normal process through which transactions that might have a national security nexus get reviewed. And I will defer to the CFIUS process rather than comment on it further from this podium.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. At the G20, would it be better if Putin was there? I mean, hes arguably the most consequential player on some of those big issues that are going to be discussed: food security and energy security.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, youll have to ask President Putin and the Kremlin why hes decided not to go, as it appears he has decided not to go. Its not really for me to comment on.\n\nWhat I can say is that President Biden is going to advance an affirmative agenda on all the issues that I laid out, and hell do that regardless of whos sitting in the chair on the Russian side.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Can I ask, then, on China? Can you give an update on the, kind of, efforts that were launched before, about a sustained dialogue on risk reduction the strategic stability talks? Where do those stand? What what has been the impediment to try to get those risk reduction talks going?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, we do believe that with the U.S. and Chinese militaries operating in proximity to one another in the Indo-Pacific and in many different areas of the Indo-Pacific, its important to have channels of communication between our militaries so that we can avoid accidents, miscalculation, escalation, and we can avoid having anything that might tip over into conflict. That, to us, is important that type of communication and that type of engagement.\n\nFurther, weve expressed our concerns about aspects of strategic stability in the context of China, as we have in the context of Russia. And weve indicated that good, substantive dialogue between significant countries like the U.S. and China can help produce greater stability over time.\n\nIm not going to get ahead of the conversations between the two presidents. These topics, of course, will be touched on. What comes of that in what form, over what time, with what participation I wont get ahead of it today.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. The President said yesterday that he found it interesting that Russia waited until after the midterm elections to announce this withdrawal from Kherson, the implication being that Russia was held off on withdrawing to have some kind of effect on the midterms. So was the President just speculating there, or do you guys have any evidence to back that up? And then I have a Griner question.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think the President what the President said should be taken at face value. He thought it was interesting timing that they you had the election on November 9th November 8th, and on November 9th they made the significant announcement on Kherson. And Ill\n\nQ So theres no evidence\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: And Ill just leave it at that.\n\nQ beyond that? And then on Brittney Griner\n\nQ Jake. Thank you, Jake.\n\nQ on Brittney Griner, what given that the President said that he would be open to meeting Putin to discuss Brittney Griners situation, would the President be willing to meet with the Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, at the G20 to discuss Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Theres no plans for the President to meet with the Russian Foreign Minister.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nQ So I want to ask you about Lebanon. Do you think this administration will deal with any elected president in Lebanon is backed up from Iran and Syria?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, I dont want to get ahead of you know, make ca-\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I dont want to make categorical statements because well have to see what comes out of the democratic process in Lebanon.\n\nWhat I will say is that the President did directly engage with President Aoun just a couple of weeks ago, in the process of bringing to conclusion a historic and significant maritime agreement involving Israel and Lebanon.\n\nSo we certainly believe its in the United States national security interest to have a relationship with the government of Lebanon because we think that that can help with regional security, with Americas security, with Israels security, and, ultimately, with the security and prosperity of the people of Lebanon.\n\nBut but Im not going to respond to hypotheticals about a president who doesnt yet (inaudible).\n\nQ Sorry, one more question. Hezbollah has been obstructing justice regarding the investigation of the Beirut explosion, and its allies as well. What is the administration doing to push that forward? We have over 226 victims, and no one really revealed any truth about this big tragedy.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: It continues to be the focus of the U.S. government, as it has been from the day that President Biden came into office, to try and drive towards answers and accountability when it comes to that explosion. And well continue to work that as actively as we possibly can.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thank you very much, Jake. Questions about Brazil. After (inaudible), after Asia, are you going to Brazil to meet with the President-elect Lula?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So we havent finalized plans, but I have been in touch with senior members of the president-elects team because we want to be able to coordinate very closely with them. Whether that involves me going down there or some folks coming here, were still working out.\n\nBut I think that you can expect face-to-face engagement at high levels between the incoming team and our team so that we can hit the ground running once President-elect Lula becomes president in January.\n\nQ And just quick a follow-up. What kind of challenges do you see with the new government of Brazil? For example, related to the Russia war in Ukraine, Lula said he will be able to talk with Russia and Ukraine to try to end the war. What do you think about that?\n\nAnd today, Secretary Kerry met with Lulas team, and they discussed help to protect the Amazon. What kind of assistance is the United States considering?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, President Biden has had a very longstanding view that it is the obligation of the United States and other major economies to help Brazil protect its rainforest. The same goes for other countries with significant rain forests, like Indonesia. And so, hes going to look for an early opportunity to sit with the incoming president, who has expressed a real commitment and motivation to protect the Amazon, and talk about a variety of forms of assistance we can give not just technical assistance, but financial assistance as well. Thats something President Biden sees as a real priority.\n\nAnd with respect to Russias war on Ukraine, President Biden had an opportunity briefly to speak with the president-elect shortly after his victory, and they agreed that they would talk in detail about all of these issues, including the Ukraine issue, when they have the chance to meet in person.\n\nIm not going to get ahead of that conversation, as I think the two of them should have the chance to talk before I characterize it.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ General Milley yesterday had a pretty staggering assessment of the casualties from Russ- of Russian casualties in this war so far, saying that 100,000 have been wounded or killed. Can you discuss what impact is this having on Putin domestically in terms of support for this war? And just how long do you think Russia can keep operating at this casualty rate?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, the numbers are really quite striking, and were talking about just an immense amount of suffering on the part not just of those who have died or been injured in the war in Ukraine, but their families and their communities across Russia.\n\nAnd one of the reasons why we believe that Russia should end this war and leave Ukraine is for the good of those families and communities inside Russia. It is difficult at the moment for us to characterize the internal political situation inside Russia.\n\nFor one thing, youve got the tight control of the Kremlin on the communications apparatus and on the political apparatus in that country. For another, all of us in this room see surprises in our own domestic political context. So trying to, you know, be effective armchair analysts of another countrys political process is something we should have significant humility about.\n\nBut we are watching closely for these impacts economically, socially, and beyond, because you simply cannot visit upon your country this level of suffering without it having reverberating impacts of various kinds. So, we will have to see how that unfolds.\n\nQ And how long do you think they could keep operating at this level of casualties?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, its clear that the fact of Russian military losses on the battlefield is having an impact on their ability to hold territory in Ukraine. Weve seen that in Kharkiv. Weve seen that in the announcement that they have made about Kherson. So, its having an impact.\n\nBut the larger \"how long\" question is not one that I can, you know, put a timetable on because war is inherently unpredictable. And so all we can do is continue to try and make sure that, for our purposes, were giving Ukraine what it needs to do its part. And then, we will, of course, analyze how Russia is postured and positioned as we go forward.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Yes. So, I wanted to ask two questions about the meeting with President Xi. One, yesterday, the President did not commit to telling President Xi that they would or the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily. How should Taiwan be interpreting that answer?\n\nAnd secondly, the Treasury released a report today saying that or criticizing China for not being more transparent about its foreign exchange policy, and explicitly calling it a \"failure.\" Will the two leaders speak about that tomorrow as well?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, on your first question, as many of you know, having seen President Biden go into consequential meetings with foreign counterparts, he doesnt like to characterize what hes going to say to them. He likes to actually go say it to them.\n\nAnd as for how Taiwan might react to that, well have the opportunity, as an administration, to brief Taiwan on the results of that meeting. And Im confident that they will feel very secure and comfortable in the United States position when it comes to our support for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act, which does commit the United States to ensuring were providing the articles for Taiwans defense.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Oh, and you asked about the FX report. I would just say that this has been a longstanding concern of the United States. Its been reflected in previous reports. It doesnt come as a significant surprise, but it is an area of significant concern for the United States.\n\nAnd I cant tell you, standing here today, whether that particular topic will come up among the wide range of things we have to discuss with the PRC.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Two questions. On Egypt, can you give us a little bit of details about the bilat between the President and President Sisi? Is regional security one of the issues going to be discussed?\n\nAnd on the meeting with Xi Jinping, can you give us some kind of assessment of how do you see Russia position vis--vis sorry, Chinas position vis--vis Russia? Do you think that you are able to neutralize them from supporting Russia so far? And what more do you think that the President can raise issues to make sure that they will stay the way it is and not involved with the war in Ukraine?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, on the PRC, we have not since President Biden and President Xi spoke some months ago seen the PRC providing military equipment, weapons for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. And we have not seen the kind of wholesale efforts to backfill or undermine the sanctions regime, though, of course, the PRC has continued its economic relationship with Russia over the course of the past many months.\n\nOne other positive signal that we have seen was during the recent visit by the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to the PRC: the statement on nuclear weapons and Xi Jinping, specifically talking about the need to avoid the use of or even the threat of the use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. And in that context of that conversation, we regarded that as constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, we believe that, of course, every country in the world should do more to prevail upon Russia, especially those who have relationships with Russia, to end this war and leave Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden will have the opportunity to talk in detail about the Ukraine crisis during his meeting with President Xi.\n\nOn the meeting with Sisi, it will cover a range of issues issues between the U.S., in terms of our strategic partnership, as well as issues in the region. And that includes, of course, Egypts role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict President Biden and President Sisi engaged directly last year during the conflict in Gaza; ongoing efforts to deal with both Gaza and the West Bank that Egypt has a stake and role in, and theyll discuss that. Theyll discuss whats happening in Yemen, where Egypt also has an important role to play, as well as a number of other critical issues in the area.\n\nQ Thank you. Thank you, Jake. I have two questions. North Korea has criticized the recent cybersecurity conference held by the United States when the President Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had this meeting. Will the two leaders discuss North Koreas cyber hacking, include nuclear issues?\n\nSecond question: Do you think North Korea will conduct its seventh nuclear test during the G20 and ASEAN Summit? If so, how will you respond?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, weve been very transparent about our concern with North Korea that the DPRK would conduct its seventh nuclear test at some point in this broader timeframe. And by \"broader,\" I mean weve been talking about this now for a couple of months. That window still remains open. Our concern still remains real. Whether it happens in the next week or not, I cant say.\n\nWe are also concerned about further potential long-range missile tests in addition to the possibility of a nuclear test.\n\nAnd so, well be watching carefully for both of those. We are in very tight coordination with both the ROK and Japan. And the trilateral meeting that the three leaders will be able to have on the margins of the East Asia Summit, I think, will be a significant milestone in the trilateral relationship and will help only strengthen coordination on DPRK.\n\nYes, I do think that the broader threat posed by North Korea in the cyber domain will be a topic of conversation between the President of the ROK and the President of the United States.\n\nQ A question on India?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah. On India. And then Ill do one more. Yeah.\n\nQ Thank you very much, sir. My question is on U.S.-India relations. President Biden has good relations with many global leaders around the globe. They can pick up the phone and call to each other.\n\nHe has similar relations with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.\n\nAnd second, sir second part of the question is if President Biden is visiting India anytime soon. Because 1.3 billion people are waiting to welcome him. And at the same time, if Prime Minister Modi is visiting the White House. Thank you, sir.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, India is the president of the G20 next year. So, President Biden certainly will intend to be a participant in that G20. I dont have anything to announce about visits prior to that, to India, or visits to the White House.\n\nBut I would point out Prime Minister Modi has already been to the White House since President Biden took office, and the two of them have had the opportunity to meet in person multiple times and to talk by phone multiple times and to talk on video multiple times.\n\nWhen you add all that up, it is a productive, very practical relationship between these two leaders who see common interests on a number of critical issues and have really worked together to strengthen the U.S.-India partnership. And President Biden is looking forward to seeing Prime Minister Modi at the G20 this year, as well as we look ahead to next year.\n\nAnd Ill take the last question.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Two quick questions. One, you mentioned sort of a robust agenda for Biden in his bilat with Sisi. Does he intend, though, to bring up human rights and specifically call for the release of jailed activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah? Is that is that part of his agenda with Sisi?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So as President Biden, I think, has said to many of you, he feels youre not the American President youre not really doing your job as the American President if youre not raising issues of human rights. So you can expect that he will raise human rights issues in that meeting, as he will with other leaders that he encounters at the G20.\n\nOn the particular case of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, we have been in high-level communication with the Egyptian government on this case. We have deep concern about it. We would like to see him freed. We have had discussions through very senior channels. And I think you can expect that those conversations will continue on the ground in Sharm el-Sheikh, when we get there.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ Jake just real quick on Xi Jinping and the meeting there. Bid- President Biden has obviously met with him many times in the past. Some of the success of those meetings was seen to be a little bit of open-ended and sometimes informalities. This will be different. But is there anything that you guys are doing to try to recreate those, sort of, more informal exchanges that the two of them had? Or is this, sort of, a meeting set up with many people alongside each side of the table that makes those types of informal discussions more difficult?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So the current setup of the meeting is one in which each of them will meet alongside their teams. But even in instances on video conferences, where each leader has had their team with them, the hallmark of their engagement no matter whos in the room is one where they dont just read talking points, they dont just kind of march methodically through each of their scripts; they actually do have a robust back and forth. And its on the bigger picture: Where is this relationship headed? Where is the PRC headed? Where is the U.S. headed?\n\nAnd especially at this moment, as the President comes out of these midterms, as Xi Jinping comes out of the 20th Party Congress, that bigger-picture conversation is probably the most important element of this meeting. Thats what the President has on his mind going in. And I think for that reason, it is going to be an important and, in my view, highly constructive contribution to how we manage this relationship going forward.\n\n(Cross-talk by reporters.)\n\nSorry, guys, I got to go.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, Jake.\n\nOkay. Can do another, like, 15 minutes. Chris, you want to kick us off?\n\nQ Sure. A question about cryptocurrencies. (Inaudible) the administration has seen those things crash. And, you know, should regulators be taking a harder look at these things to protect investors at this point?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So Im not able to comment on it on what specific actions independent regular- regulators should or should not take on this particular issue. But what I can say is the administration is aware of the recent developments on this, and well just continue to monitor the situation.\n\nQ Should the administration do legislation you know, new things that should be done to protect people?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the administration, as you know, Chris, has consistently maintained that without proper oversight, cryptocurrencies they it risks harming everyday Americans. So this is something that, clearly, we monitor and that we see as an important important issue.\n\nBut the most recent news further underscores these concerns and highlights why prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies is indeed needed. The White House, along with the relevant agencies, will, again, closely monitor the situation as it cont- as it develops.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ One just a quick follow-up on foreign policy first. Kevin McCarthy has said that he would love to lead a congressional delegation to Taiwan. Im just curious if you would discourage him from doing that if he becomes Speaker.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thats not something Im going to speak to about. As you know, when you all were asking us about the Speakers travel, we did not comment about her travel. Were certainly not going to do that with Kevin McCarthy.\n\nQ Okay. And then, just on the CPI statement this morning from the President: Most of the increase that we saw in inflation last month was due to rising costs for shelter. President Bidens statement didnt mention that. What is the administration doing to contain the rampant run-up in rents right now?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Of shelter specifically?\n\nQ Shelter costs, yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I dont have anything right now to share with you on that specific piece of the data.\n\nAs you know, the report the way that we saw it, and as the President says, it shows that we are making progress, which is important as we talk about CPI, on bringing inflation down.\n\nAs you know, inflation has been a number-one top priority when it comes to the economy those lowering costs for the American people. And so, without driving without giving up all of our progress, clearly, that we have made with the economy when we look at the job the labor market, the job creation.\n\nSo the prese- the Presidents economic plan, as we know as we see it right now, because of this data and many other pieces of data that we have seen we are seeing some strength, and it continues to grow. And we were put in a situation to manage to manage our economy through these global challenges.\n\nSo, again, we think that the data that we saw with CPI is a is a step forward. The President clearly is going to continue to do the work to bring down cost for the American people. We talked about the gas prices and also Inflation Reduction Act. So that will continue to be.\n\nBut that particular piece of the data, I dont have anything to share with you on that.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. President Biden yesterday drew some red lines on issues where he will not compromise with Republicans: Medicare, Social Security, a national abortion ban. He also did say that he would be willing to compromise with Republicans on some other issues, but he didnt say which ones specifically. So what are the areas where you guys do see room for compromise with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, the results are all the results are not in yet, so dont want to get ahead of that. And well have a better sense, hopefully in the next couple of days, if not the next couple of weeks, of, you know, what the Congress the complexion of the Congress is going to look like.\n\nI think what the President was trying to say is that the American people made themselves very clear. You know, the last couple of months, youve heard the President lay out the stark contrast; he laid out the choices that the American people had to make just a couple of days ago and they were very clear about that which is making sure that we continue to lower costs; making sure that we do not repeal Inflation Reduction Act; making sure that we continue to deliver for the American people; making sure that lets not forget democracy was also a choice that the American people made.\n\nAnd so thats what hes talking about. Hes talking about the basically, the wins that we have been able to deliver for the American people. Hes not willing to roll that back.\n\nAnd as we know, congressional Republicans made themselves very clear, leading up to Tuesday, that they were going to roll back Medicare, they were going to roll back Social Security not even roll it back, just cut it all off right? chop it out.\n\nAnd so the President is saying hes just not willing to do that. And lets not forget these are issues that the American people see as very popular and important to them. So thats what hes talking about.\n\nQ I understand you dont want to get ahead of the results, but it was the President who said yesterday that hed be willing to compromise on certain issues. So has he not thought through what those issues would be? Its just a general statement?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No no, I hear your question. Youre saying hes been willing to compromise. But at the same time, we have to see what the results are.\n\nAnd of course hes going to say that; hes the President of the United States. Of course hes going to say, \"Im willing to work with the other side.\" Were talking about President Biden, who has done that. He also laid out that he has since his administration, in the past 20-plus months, he has passed 200 bipartisan laws will sign 200 bipartisan laws.\n\nAnd so he is saying that hes willing to work with the other side, as he has said before. But we you know, once we know what were working with in the next, hopefully, you know, couple of days, if not longer, then hell well have those conversation and can talk more.\n\nQ And then quickly on democracy. The President yesterday talked about, you know, this being an example that democracy works. He really emphasized that. I think hes expected to talk about that later today, as well.\n\nI know that you guys have pointed to some statewide races where some prominent election deniers did not win. But I believe, at the latest count, at least 145 election deniers running for the U.S. House have won their races.\n\nSo, given that, how does the President assess the state of U.S. democracy and the health of that democracy when so many election deniers are being elected to Congress a majority of the Republican caucus?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the President has been very clear that he still sees that he believes our democracy is still under under threat and that the American people have to defend it. Thats something that hes going to continue to say. And the part of that is rejecting election lies or those who would use violence to overthrow democracy.\n\nAnd so you did see that from the American people. But, again, its still under threat. It one election will not change that. Right? And so theres still work to be done. Theres still work to strengthen our democracy, and theres still work to protect our democracy.\n\nAgain, its not going to happen under one election or even 2020 election. Right? Weve continued to work towards that.\n\nOkay, Mary.\n\nQ Can I follow up on that real quick?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Ill come to the back in a second.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Can you describe more of the Presidents phone call yesterday with Leader McCarthy? He noted they dont have much of a personal relationship, so how did it go? Did he get a sense that there are areas where they will be able to compromise, going forward?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Im not going to get into into more details onto into their private conversation. Im sure I think Im sure Leader McCarthy will have more to say on his end.\n\nBut look, I think the way to look at the conversation and the President speaking with Kevin McCarthy is that he is willing, as he said yesterday, to work with with folks on the other side of the aisle, as he has in the past. Hes willing to do things in a bipartisan way. This is a President who has who has made that a priority, not just as President but as Vice President and also as senator.\n\nAnd so hes just as long we are delivering for the American people, that is something that he wants to see. And weve done that. Lets not forget the the gun legislation. We saw movement on guns in that we hadnt seen in 30 years. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation. The CHIPS and Science Act. The PACT Act to actually really give us some relief, some healthcare to our veterans.\n\nSo theres ways that we can work together. But well see. You know, well see what that what the agenda will be.\n\nQ And is the President going to go down to Georgia to lend some support to Raphael Warnock in this runoff? Is that under consideration?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I dont have anything for you right now to speak to, but clearly, the President will do whatever Senator Warnock needs him to do to help him win. The DNC made significant investments in Georgia this year. But again, I dont have anything right now to lay out as far as any travel that the President will be making.\n\nQ Has Warnock made a request?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I actually have not I have not heard of a request. I just dont have anything to share on that.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Israel follow-up?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: And Ill come to the back.\n\nQ Karine, thank you so much. The President is obviously going to this climate summit, to COP27. How does he reassure leaders, given that he is anticipating a Republican Congress, that any new agreements that they come to will be carried out here, will be codified if need be, given that hes got to reach across the aisle with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Say that last part. How can he\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: How does he reassure the leaders that whatever new agreements they reach there will be carried out, will be codified here, given that we are expecting that he will be working with a Republican-led House?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I think I mean, this is a President who has been in front of world leaders, who have who has traveled abroad, as you know, multiple times in the past 20-plus months of his presidency and, lets not forget, as Vice President and, lets not forget, as senator.\n\nSo he has, as we know, a lot of respect for some of these leaders. He has very close relationships with many of these leaders. He has done business, if you will, and talked about really key important issues over the last few years, if not decades. So I think theres a level of trust and understanding on how this works.\n\nAnd, you know, I I also feel as if I also think that we dont want to go too far right? because were still waiting on results. Were still waiting on what will happen with with Congress, both the Senate and the House.\n\nBut again, it was a good night for Democrats. It was a historic night for Democrats. And like Jake said just from here, just moments ago, the President goes into you know, goes to Asia with the wind at his back. And its not the first time. One of the last times he went, it was the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. You know, there are wins that he they have seen us deliver on. And so I think theres there is a level of trust with this particular President.\n\nQ I just want to ask you one quickly on the economy. Inflation not as high as was expected, but we are hearing about these layoffs at these major companies, Meta and Twitter. What is the message to American companies who are concerned that those layoffs could be a sign that the economy could be headed toward a recession?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So we are aware of the layoffs at Meta and other other tech companies that you just laid out, Kristen. I dont have a comment on the moves announced by Meta today, specifically. But more broadly speaking, the most recent jobs and CPI report the one from today suggest that the U.S. economy continues to grow, and its also adding jobs, which is incredibly important.\n\nAnd Americans are begin- beginning to see a much more needed break in inflation. So that does matter. If you just look at CPI, lets not forget the GDP, where we saw the last quarter we saw the economy grow by 2.6 percent. All of this all these data points matter as to how were how were growing and where were headed in the economy.\n\nQ Youve said several times from this perch right here that the White House wants to remain independent from the Justice Department. I cover the Justice Department at DOJ. Those folks will say, \"We want to stay totally independent.\"\n\nI know Jake was asked earlier by Weijia about this comment with Elon Musk and having people its worthy of looking into Elon Musks relationship with other businesses. He talked about CFIUS. CFIUS is made up of the Treasury Department and DOJ officials. The President has been criticized in the past for talking about the Department of Justice and looking into people relating to January 6th subpoenas. What did he mean what does that mean when the President says \"worthy of being looked into\"? Its raising some questions.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, just answered that question. Im just not going to go beyond that. He is he is, as you know, the advisor to the National Security Council. Im just not going to go beyond that.\n\nAnd as the President said, and as I have said many times, we just refer you to the committee. I dont have anything else to add.\n\nQ And, Karine, one follow-up. I wanted to ask Jake this. When the President meets with President Xi its their first time meeting in person since President Biden took office when he comes back, I know its too early to tell if Republicans are going to take control the Senate, of the House. If so, even if one body if they want to investigate and when I say \"they,\" I mean Republicans the origins of COVID-19 thats something Republicans have on their agenda; theyve been talking about it will President Biden ask President Xi about the origins of COVID-19 and bring up that issue with him in person?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, Im not going to get and Jake has said this as well Im not going to get ahead of the agenda of what theyre going to discuss when they have their bilat.\n\nCertainly, we will share the conversation and what came up. The President has always been clear on getting to the bottom of COVID and has been very clear in reports that we have put out on the origins of COVID as well, but Im just not going to get ahead of that conversation.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. The President said yesterday, \"Im not going to change anything in a fundamental way.\" But the Presidents approval ratings are still low, with an overwhelming majority of voters in exit polls said the country is headed in the wrong direction, especially on the economy. So is how is the White House sort of squaring those two things? Is is there no change needed, I guess, in terms of satisfying those voters who are saying that they think the country is headed in a wrong direction?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, we think that well, let me step back for a second. What the President was talking about then he wasnt going to renegotiate renegotiate things that have already passed, right?\n\nYou think about the Inflation Reduction Act, and you think about what thats going to do for the American people lowering costs, which is something that he has said is going to be a priority for him. And continuing to do that lowering healthcare costs, lowering energy costs, which he also said this yesterday American people are going to feel early next year, which is just a few weeks away, a couple of months a month or two away.\n\nAnd so thats what when we talk about that, Republicans were very clear: They wanted to repeal that. They wanted to take away the Inflation Reduction Act. And so thats what the President was talking about, making sure that we do not take away the things that the things that we have been able to accomplish, the successes that we have been able to see for the American people.\n\nLook, I know youre talking about the Presidents poll. But the thing about it is: When you look at these pieces of legislation, when you look at the work that we have done, when you look at the issues that the President has worked on, theyre all popular. When you think about abortion rights and you think about how how how that was a top priority for the for the American people, that is something the President is working on.\n\nYou think about inflation: Yes, the American people are feeling that every day, but the President has also worked on these issues. And those are the things hes not going to stop on. Those are things hes not going to pull back on. Trying to lower gas prices as another example of the things that hes done.\n\nQ A question in the back?\n\nQ Israel?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible.)\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Prior to the election, the President said that he would send a bill that would codify Roe v. Wade to Congress if Democrats gained two seats. At best, he may only gain one seat in the Senate, so is it still his intention to send a bill to codify it?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I Ill say this: Whats clear in this weeks election what we saw on Tuesday is that Americans dont want to see a constitutional a right that they had for 50 years taken away. They made that very clear. We saw that in California, Vermont, Michigan when they enshrined abortion rights in their own state from voters. We saw in Montana and Kentucky where they rejected measures that would have restricted access to reproductive care. So they made their voices very, very clear. They want to see their their access to reproductive care protected, and they want to see Roe codified. And were going to do everything that we can to make that happen from here.\n\nAgain, we have to see what the results are. I know that you just laid out that we potentially could pick up have have the Senate by one, but we just have to see what the complexion of Congress is going to look like, and then well well move forward from there.\n\nQ Is there anything else that the President thinks he can do if there is only one seat in the Senate? Codifying Roe would be difficult. So is there anything else to ensure abortion access (inaudible)?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, you know, the President has certainly taken actions from the federal government, with his the HHS Agency and Department of Justice. Weve laid out executive actions that the President has taken. Were always looking to see what else we can do.\n\nBut, again, I mean, the President has always been very clear: In order to really make sure that we protect womens rights, we have to take action on the legislative level, and hes going to do everything that he can.\n\nLets not forget, people have said he wasnt going to get the bipartisan infrastructure legislation done. He got it done.\n\nPeople didnt think he was going to get the CHIPS and Science Act done. We got it done.\n\nPeople didnt think we were going to get the guns legislation done in a bipartisan way. We got that done. That was after the last time that we were able to do that was 30 years ago.\n\nSo we have been able to get things done, and thats because of this Presidents leadership. So, again, were going to continue to focus on that and make sure that we actually, you know, deliver for what the American people want from us.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Hey, Karine. Can I ask specifically about an area of compromise that has interest from different groups? Does the President see marriage equality as a potential where that he and the Democrats can work together with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, again, not going to get ahead of what of what what the next couple of weeks are going to look like as far as an agenda. Clearly, marriage equality is something thats important to the President; he has been a leader of, and a strong ally for, the LGBTQ+ community. And he has spoken to the importance of moving that piece of legislation forward. And so, of course, were going to continue to work on that.\n\nBut Im not going to get ahead of what our agenda is going to look like before we actually know what the Congress is going to going to be.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Given the underperformance of candidates who were backed by the former President Trump, what does President Biden believe that says about Trumps standing in the Republican Party?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, meaning like the basically, the candidates that he put forward?\n\nQ Correct.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So and the President has said this you heard him say this many times over the last especially the last several weeks is that the election was a choice, not a referendum. As the President said, again, through throughout the fall, so Republican candidates said their top priority was undoing the Inflation Reduction Act, which would raise prescription jobs [costs], which would raise energy costs and also healthcare costs. And so they were very clear on how they were going to lay out ways that it would hurt the economy, worsen inflation.\n\nAnd so Democrats ran on an agenda that was going to deliver for the American people.\n\nWe believe that choice was very, very clear for the it was made very clear for the American people. And what we saw was that the American people rejected the MAGA extremism, and they voted for democracy as well.\n\nAnd so, I cant speak to, you know, what what what the you know, what the candidates or what the Republican Party feel about their leader.\n\nBut what I can speak to is what we ran on and what we laid out, and what we heard from the American people on what was important to them and what we can speak to with what congressional Republicans were trying to do, which is take us back, which is take away peoples rights. And the American people responded.\n\nQ But but, I mean, specifically Trump-backed Republicans. Does the President think that, you know, their losses show that he is losing power within the GOP?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I cant speak to the support that he has or doesnt have. What I could speak to and as youre asking me about the particular you know, the folks that he backed, they were extreme. Right? They were MAGA extremists. And thats what I mean, right? They were people who wanted to take away our freedoms, take away our rights, as we talk about abortion and, you know, codifying Roe.\n\nThey were folks who wanted to just pull back and take away the Inflation Reduction Act actually take that away, something that was incredibly historic. They wanted to do the opposite of what were trying to do, which is deliver for the American people. They had extreme views, even on as election deniers even on democracy.\n\nYou heard the President deliver very strong strong remarks on democracy not too long ago. And so, he laid that out, what we were seeing from these particular extreme candidates.\n\nAnd, you know, thats what we can speak to. And I think thats what the American people decided on. And thats the stark the stark differences that the American public saw.\n\nQ And one quick one on China that I meant to ask Jake, but I didnt want to ask him four questions. (Laughter.) So, on that briefing call, an administration official said that one of the main objectives is to deepen their understanding of each others priorities, with a goal of reducing misunderstanding and misperceptions. What do you think are some misconceptions, misperceptions, misunderstandings that China has about the U.S.?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, I dont I dont want to get into deep specifics. You know, I think you guys have followed the relationship between the two leaders over the last 20-plus months.\n\nLook, I think whats important to note is that and we youve heard us say this too the President really think its important to have that face-to-face, leader-to-leader conversation. And and, you know, the President and Xi has spoken, I think, about five times which weve all read out to you when they have spoken and this will be the first time theyll be in person.\n\nAnd it you know, we believe the President believes it is critical to build a floor for the relationship and ensure that there are rules of the road that bound our competition. But building a floor is not just about that, its also ensuring that we also are working together on areas where our interests align, especially trans- transnational challenges that affect the international community.\n\nSo, there are a lot of things that I think that they are going to discuss. This will be, again, their first meeting in person. But dont want to characterize that meeting too much because I want to make sure that the leaders the two leaders, the President and President Xi, have an opportunity to have a really in-depth conversation and talk about the interests that matter to both of them.\n\nQ Karine, Israel?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Karen. And then Ill go to the back.\n\nQ Karine, if you could just talk a bit about the lame duck Congress session right now. Beyond the must-do items that Congress has to do, like funding the government, what are some of the top items on the wish list right now for the administration that you want to do while you still have the House and the Senate?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the President is going to look for is looking forward to talking to both Democrats and Republicans once those results are in. Of course, the President believes we should get government fund- keep the government funded, right? thats going to be an important priority including what we need to respond to the to disasters; continue to defend democracy in Ukraine, as you heard from Jake talk about our commitment to Ukraine; and fight new COVID variants. So those are the things, clearly, that are a priority for this President.\n\nAnd we should pass the overdue marriage equality bill, as I was just asked just seconds ago; pass the Electoral Reform Act and the Defense Authorization bill, as well, which should include Senator Manchins permitting bill. And we need to finish confirming the judicial nominations he made earlier this year.\n\nSo those are the things that we believe thats important to work on. Again, we look forward to discussing this with Democrats both Democrats and Republicans, once we know once the results are in.\n\nQ And how about something big on the debt ceiling, as some Democrats are calling for right now?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, its again, its premature to say what the complexion of the House is going to look like. But the President is looking forward to having those discussion you know, priorities with Democrats and Republicans, as I was just saying; their congressional leaders. The debt limit should never be a matter of political brinksmanship, as youve heard us say.\n\nThe President looks forward to working with Congress to responsibly address the debt limit before its expiration. But again, were going to were going to see the results once they come in. And he looks forward to having those conversations with leaders from from both sides.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thank you. You talked a little bit earlier about a list of what the President was able to do versus what he wasnt able to do. And for those especially in the African American community who helped win take Biden to the presidency, when you talk about going forward in these next couple of years, do you think, given those who are recently elected, that youll have more or less ground when it comes to issues of criminal justice reform and voting rights?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, when it comes to those two issues voting rights, criminal justice reform that is something that the President sees as a priority. And when it comes to the Black community, the President has seen their issues as a priority as well. Right?\n\nI think everything if you think about everything that the President has done, you think about the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, you think about the American Rescue Plan, you think about CHIPS the CHIPS and Science Act, you think about the Inflation Reduction Act, all of those pieces of legislation that are now law had what we believe equity at the center of it. Right?\n\nThe President says all the time he wants to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because he does not want to leave anyone behind. He wants to make sure if you think about the American Rescue Plan, he wants to make sure that people are able when he put that forward that people were able to hold on to their homes, that people were able to start small businesses; investing in HBCUs, in education, when you think about the student loan debt debt forgiveness policy. All of those things are meant to help families in the African American community but also just Americans across the board.\n\nAnd so that is something that the President has done to make sure that we dont leave anyone behind.\n\nBut to your question about criminal justice reform and also voting rights, yes, that is something thats a priority that we need to make sure that we dont leave anyone behind.\n\nBut to your question about criminal justice reform and also voting rights: Yes, that is something thats a priority that we need to make sure that we work towards getting getting those pieces of legislation done. And the President is going to continue to work with Congress.\n\nQ Really quickly: For the states who you talk about the infrastructure bill for the states who did not use the money the way they that that the that the Biden administration wanted them to\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: You mean the American Rescue Plan?\n\nQ Im sorry, the American Rescue Plan. Forgive me. American Rescue Plan. Do you think that they have even hurt how some Re- some pe- Americans who were not in favor of Democrats or in favor of Biden and gave him low ratings, do you think that might have hurt? Because even though the money was passed, it wasnt spent like they thought it was going to be spent in their communities, and so that judgment came right back on the President.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Im let me see if I understood what you just laid out. So the American Rescue Plan, yes, there are some states that have not used the funding to its to its full capacity\n\nQ Exactly.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Right? I understand that.\n\nAnd we have always encouraged those states and worked closely with local officials and and state state officials to see to make sure, to encourage them to use those those funding, because theyre meant for everything that I just laid out. And so thats something that were going to continue to encourage, continue to have those conversations.\n\nI didnt quite get where you were what was the second part of your question?\n\nQ Well, because many Americans may not have seen\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, I see.\n\nQ what they thought, that that also may have even hurt Democrats.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I mean, I cant I cant speak to that, because Ive not seen that the data on that. But, look, I think its unfortunate I think its unfortunate if local officials or state or state officials refuse to use the funding that was provided through the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWe have to remember what was in the American Rescue Plan. Lets not forget the Child Tax Credit that helped lower poverty among children. We cannot forget how it helped small businesses get going again. We cannot forget how it opened helped open schools. When the President walked in, there were more a majority of schools were shut down.\n\nSo there are there was so much in that American Rescue Plan that met the moment. And it is unfortunate if if politicians use that in a political way, if elected officials use that in a political way, and not give that service that was provided this funding that was provided to their constituents. Because, again, the President is not a President for blue states or red states. He says this all the time: Hes a President for all Americans.\n\nIm going to take one more. Im going to take one last question.\n\nQ Karine, you said in the back (inaudible) question.\n\nQ Who did you call on?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible). You.\n\nQ Me?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ Whom exactly Jake has been talking to at Kremlin during the last month? And what exactly was the aim of these talks? Was it avoiding escalation or maybe mutual mutual recognition? And or maybe are these talks aimed to lead to something more for example, the negotiations?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we I think youre talking about when Jake was the reporting.\n\nQ During the last months.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So, you know, I think youre talking about the negotiations that people are saying right? that has been reported.\n\nSo, you know, people claim a lot of things about the conversations that the United States has. I dont have any specific conversations to read out to you at this time.\n\nAnd but, you know, we reserve the right to speak directly at senior levels, as you have heard Jake say just just moments ago, about issues that concern the United States.\n\nBut we want to be very clear: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. It is it is it is something that the President has said; it is something that we take very, very you know, we take we see that as a very important strategy moving forward.\n\nThis is Ukraines decision when it comes to any type of negotiations. We see our part in making sure that we strengthen, you know, through we strengthen their their you know, their part in this, whether it is making sure that they have the security assis- the security assistance to defend themselves, as they have been very bravely, or when its time, when they choose, to to negotiate.\n\nBut again: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So Ill leave it there.\n\nThanks, everybody. Thank you.\n\n2:04 P.M. EST",

Although humanitarian organizations have scaled up their response, much more must be done first is ending the senseless war, he said.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) focus is increasingly on helping displaced people in Ukraine, while trying to be present wherever there is forced displacement, he emphasized. Notwithstanding the European Unions open, well-managed and shared response, UNHCR is maintaining a high level of preparedness for further population movements, both inside and outside Ukraine, given the likely protracted nature of the military situation.\n\n\"In the past 12 months alone, UNHCR has responded to 37 emergencies around the world. Yet, the other crises are failing to capture the same international attention, outrage, resources and action,\" he emphasized. Detailing the situation of displaced persons across the globe, from Myanmar's Rohingya refugees to Afghan and Syrian refugees, and those displaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, he voiced concern that crisis and protracted situations are not only fading from media attention, but are being failed by global inaction.\n\nThe confluence of climate change and conflict has created very protracted displacement, he underscored, urging greater international and support for inclusion and integration both in refugee contexts and situations of internal displacement. Responses to climate change must consider both its link to conflict, and the displacement it causes, he stressed, voicing hope that they will be in clear focus at the upcoming twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe international community, starting with Council members, must overcome divisions at the very least on humanitarian issues, he stressed. Voicing alarm at the major funding gap in 2022, he pointed out that food aid for refugees has been cut in many operations. He urged strengthening the capacity of the police, judiciary and local Government and overall rule of law in fragile countries. Humanitarians must be able to operate everywhere lives must be saved, he stressed.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, Council members, united in their concern about the increase in refugees and protracted conflict, highlighted the ways in which they are supporting UNHCR and persons displaced from different parts of the world. Several delegates urged equal treatment for all seeking refuge, while others called for greater funding for UNHCR and unimpeded humanitarian access.\n\nIrelands representative, on that point, stressed that there can be no impunity for those who target humanitarian actors or who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war. As carve-outs are an important principle for any sanctions regime, he said Ireland, together with the United States, has put forward a proposal to mainstream humanitarian carve-outs across all sanctions regimes.\n\nMexicos representative, spotlighting refugees other critical needs, called on UNHCR to systematically include mentalhealth services and psychosocial support in its regional and national responses. His country is the third largest receiver of new claims for refugee status, he said, noting that 72 per cent of these claims have received a positive response. He expressed hope that the Global Refugee Forum in 2023 will generate comprehensive solutions to guarantee the rights of all refugees and internally displaced people.\n\nKenyas representative expressed grave concern about the worrying trend in recent years of people of African descent travelling to Europe via the Mediterranean, who suffer extreme human rights violations, with thousands losing their lives. They must be treated humanely and given opportunities to make a decent living, he stressed, calling for the international communitys renewed commitment to assist countries in tackling the root causes of displacement.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation pointed to the \"irresponsible policies of Western States\" as the cause of conflicts, poverty and economic inequality that have forced populations out of their countries of origin. The Ukrainian crisis has intensified because of the unwillingness of authorities encouraged by Western patrons to not implement the Minsk agreements, he said.\n\nChinas representative, noting that 83 per cent of refugees are supported by developing countries, called on the international community to mobilize resources and strengthen cooperation to ensure refugees are protected. The Council must assume its primary responsibility of promoting political settlements and fostering a peaceful environment, through support for post-conflict rebuilding and creating favourable conditions for refugees to return, he said.\n\nAlso speaking today were representatives of the United States, France, Brazil, Gabon, Albania, United Arab Emirates, India, Norway, United Kingdom and Ghana.\n\nThe meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 12:14 p.m.\n\nBriefing\n\nFILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, thanked Ghana, which holds this months Security Council presidency, for its commitment to refugee protection, inclusion and solutions. He asked Council members to look at the multiplicity of global challenges growing conflicts, climate emergency, pandemics, energy and food crises through the eyes of the more than 103 million refugees and displaced people, who are among the most impacted by all of them. He noted that, in so doing, they will feel with desperate urgency the need for the international community to cooperate to reverse the current trajectory and find solutions, while regrettably also observe the 15-member organs failure to do so. The Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine has driven the fastest, largest displacement witnessed in decades, he underscored, noting that some 14 million people have been forced from their homes since 24 February. Ukrainians are about to face one of the worlds harshest winters in extremely difficult circumstances. Humanitarian organizations have dramatically scaled up their response, but much more must be done, starting with an end to the senseless war, he said.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) focus is increasingly on helping displaced people in Ukraine, working under the Governments able leadership, he said, pointing out that among the neighbouring countries, the Republic of Moldova continues to need special attention, given its vulnerability. Meanwhile in the European Union, he said UNHCR has seen an open, well managed and above all shared refugee response that has proven wrong many of the statements frequently repeated by some politicians: that Europe is full; that relocation is impossible; that there is no public support for refugees. Given the likely protracted nature of the military situation, UNHCR is maintaining a high level of preparedness for further population movements, both inside and outside Ukraine, considering different possible scenarios and the scope and limitations of humanitarian assistance. \"In the past 12 months alone, UNHCR has responded to 37 emergencies around the world. Yet, the other crises are failing to capture the same international attention, outrage, resources and action,\" he said.\n\nUNHCR is trying to be present wherever there is forced displacement, such as in Ethiopia where more than 850,000 were displaced in the first half of 2022, he continued. He called on the Council to urge a positive outcome of talks between the parties in South Africa, warning that failure in peace talks would undoubtedly bring more death, destruction and displacement, and further restrict UNCHRs already limited ability to reach those in need, in Tigray and other regions. UNHCR is also in Myanmar, where an estimated 500,000 people were also displaced in the first six months of 2022, with humanitarian access remaining a huge challenge. Conditions for the return of almost a million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, where options for them are limited, remain a very distant possibility, he added. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, brutal attacks, including revolting accounts of sexual violence against women, has added more than 200,000 people to the 5.5 million already displaced in the country.\n\nThese crises, and many more, including the countless protracted situations like those of Afghan and Syrian refugees, and some of the multiple, complex population flows in the Americas, are not only fading from media attention but are being failed by global inaction, he stressed. The intersection of climate change and displacement, in many situations, includes a clear connection with conflict as well, he pointed out, underscoring that climate change is ravaging resources that have sustained communities for generations. This creates tensions, often of an intercommunal nature, especially in already fragile contexts where Governments do not have the assets or even control of territory to support adaptation and resilience strategies and programmes, he added, voicing concern that without greater attention and much greater financing for prevention, adaptation, and development and governance support, tensions, frustrations and competition will grow and spark wider conflict, with deadly consequences, including displacement.\n\nHe recalled his meeting last week in Somalia with emaciated men, women and children who had walked for days to get help, including mothers whose children had died en route. They were people who had outlived conflict just to have their last remaining coping mechanisms their crops and their cattle die before their eyes, he said. There, and elsewhere, conflict is also an obstacle to relief, as humanitarians are often prevented from helping people in their places of origin by insecurity and fighting. He also met with Somali refugees pushed into already drought-affected areas of Kenya, he said, highlighting that countrys generations long extraordinary hospitality to refugees and its landmark shift from encampment of refugees to inclusion. The confluence of climate change and conflict has created very protracted displacement, he underscored, urging greater international and support for inclusion and integration both in refugee contexts and situations of internal displacement. He voiced concern about the many hotspots affected by that spiral, especially throughout the Sahel, where the convergence of climate change, poverty, and weak governance with the action of armed groups, and the often-brutal reaction of Governments, have already displaced 3 million people, including increasingly to coastal States like Ghana, as well as to North Africa and Europe. Responses to climate change must consider both its link to conflict, and the displacement it causes, he stressed, voicing hope that they will be in clear focus at the upcoming twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nUNHCR has stepped up legal support to States; upped its operational response for those displaced by climate and conflict, like in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel or Mozambique; increased efforts to reduce the environmental damage caused by massive displacement, such as in Niger or Bangladesh; and used artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to try and at least prepare for displacement of this nature. Underscoring key areas for support, he called for greater resources for humanitarian aid, which is under enormous pressure. UNHCR, despite a record level of income, including $1 billion from private donors, faces a major funding gap in 2022 in some of its crucial operations. Food aid for refugees, for example, has been cut in many operations for lack of funding despite the help of the United States and other Council members, at a time where food insecurity is growing, he said, stressing the crucial importance of the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Peacebuilding must be seriously strengthened by reinforcing the capacity of the police, the judiciary, local government and overall rule of law in fragile countries. In addition, humanitarian action must be better safeguarded, from different viewpoints, he said, stressing that parties to conflicts must protect humanitarian work and enable access those in need. Furthermore, everyone must uphold international humanitarian law and contribute to preserving the civilian character of refugee settings. \"No matter how polarized the context, humanitarians must be able to operate everywhere lives must be saved,\" he stressed, welcoming the Councils current efforts to ensure greater predictability in humanitarian carve-outs.\n\n\"We need the international community, starting with you, members of the Security Council, to overcome your divisions and disagreements at least when you discuss humanitarian issues; and hopefully when you address the root causes that are displacing people around the world,\" he urged. Those that have contributed the least to global challenges are suffering most from their consequences, he stressed.\n\nStatements\n\nMICHAEL KIBOINO ( Kenya ) expressed deep concern about the continued increase in refugees due to protracted armed conflict, economic crises and climate change impacts, noting that 83 per cent of refugees globally are hosted by developing countries, with the least developed providing asylum to 7 million people representing a 27 per cent of the global total of refugees. Host countries, particularly developing ones, shoulder the largest responsibility of the global refugee crisis, despite formidable challenges. Many of these challenges are experienced by his own country, he continued, noting that the High Commissioner had witnessed first-hand the situation of refugees in Kenya, in Kakuma and Dadaab camps, as well as witnessed how the ravages of drought in Somalia are leading to a devastating double tragedy of displacement, first by conflict, and then by extreme weather events. Kenya will continue to uphold its obligations to host and protect refugees and will continue to advocate for continued burden and responsibility sharing in line with the global compact on refugees. He went on to call for sufficient funding to enable UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, pointing out that the international community has consistently underfunded appeals made by developing countries and the Refugee Agency. Further, wealthiest countries with high-employment economies should do more to resettle refugees, beyond providing support to UNHCR. He expressed grave concern about the worrying trend in recent years of people of African descent travelling to Europe via the Mediterranean, who suffer extreme violations of their human rights, with thousands losing their lives, and called for them to be treated humanely and given opportunities to make a decent living. He went on to call for the root causes of displacement to be comprehensively tackled, including through renewed political commitment from the international community to assist source countries.\n\nLINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ) expressed hope that Council members will support a proposal that her country and Ireland have put on the table to create a standardized humanitarian carve-out for those under sanctioned regimes. She shared that her Government has launched \"Uniting for Ukraine\", a process for Ukrainians to seek humanitarian parole in her country, providing refuge for over 190,000 people so far. Recalling that the drought in Somalia has displaced nearly 1 million people in 2022, she reported that her country provided over $850 million this year as part of its efforts to address the situation in the Horn of Africa, while calling on others to follow suit. Expressing alarm over reports that refugees returning to Syria have faced torture, arbitrary detention and forced disappearance, she urged the Council to \"put politics aside\" and extend the cross-border aid mandate in January. Also touching on the situations in Ethiopia, Kenya and Venezuela, she commended UNHCRs new initiative which emphasizes the need of innovative approaches, especially new digital tools for enhancing community feedback.\n\nNICOLAS DE RIVIRE ( France ) noting the \"sad record\" of 100 million displaced persons across the globe in 2022, pointed to multiple causes, from climate change to food insecurity. Saluting the remarkable courage and dedication of all personnel at the Refugee Agency, he noted that the Russian Federations aggression has resulted in the largest population displacement in the world since the Second World War. His country has pledged to provide humanitarian aid and is welcoming Ukrainian refugees, he said, adding that France has also doubled voluntary contributions to UNHCR since 2021, making the country the Refugee Agencys eighth largest donor. Further, France will co-sponsor the next Global Refugee Forum at the end of 2023. Stressing that his country will not compromise on the fundamental principles regarding return of refugees, he called on Damascus to remove all obstacles preventing the return of Syrian refugees.\n\nJOO GENSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO ( Brazil ) stated that his country has granted protection through its humanitarian visa policy to people affected by the conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine, along with Haitians and Syrians. He added that since 2018, over 770,000 Venezuelan migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers have received assistance from its \"Operation Welcome\". Noting the reports of unintended consequences of United Nations sanctions on humanitarian assistance, he encouraged the Council to continue its work to adjust the sanctions framework, so that they effectively minimize the suffering of civilians. While acknowledging that sanctions can be legitimate and effective when they are multilaterally created, strategically targeted and designed to have minimal impact on the civilian population, he pointed out that they will have unintended consequences, but that the humanitarian space must always be preserved.\n\nMARTIN GALLAGHER ( Ireland ), noting the Russian Federations war against Ukraine, said his country has welcomed and given shelter to tens of thousands of Ukrainians. Underscoring the indisputable link between climate change and displacement, he said that for the Council to fully understand conflict drivers and consequences, it has the responsibility to understand the impact of climate on security. Greater humanitarian aid is needed for the Horn of Africa, he stressed, calling on the Council to redouble its attention to instability, conflict and the pursuit of peace. Those blocking aid delivery must cease and facilitate immediate unhindered humanitarian access, he said, stressing that there can be no impunity for those who target humanitarian actors or who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war. Turning to the situation in Haiti, he said Haitians who are seeking refuge must not be turned away or sent back. Carve-outs are an important principle for any sanctions regime, he pointed out, noting that Ireland, together with the United States, has put forward a proposal to mainstream humanitarian carve-outs across all sanctions regimes. The Council has the responsibility to use tools available when required, but they must be effective and without unintended consequences for humanitarian efforts. Moreover, it must hear directly from refugees and displaced people those bearing the brunt of Council inaction and inadequacy, he said. Irelands funding for UNCHR continues to grow with core funding at its highest level ever, he said, affirming ongoing support for the High Commissioner and the Refugee Agency.\n\nMICHEL XAVIER BIANG ( Gabon ), citing figures from UNHCR, noted that since 2021 the world has seen 42 new emergency situations in 30 countries, forcing displacement, adding that the war in Ukraine has displaced millions of people in that country and around Europe. Further, climate change is worsening the situation, spurring forced displacement, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa, which is only set to worsen in the future, he said, adding: \"However, the international community is not doing enough to share the cost of protecting those seeking asylum.\" The current financing does not make it possible to respond to the myriad challenges, including food insecurity, epidemics, the safety of women, particularly in refugee camps, and providing access to education for the youngest. He called for true cooperation for equitable burden sharing. While hailing Ukraines neighbours for their solidarity in hosting most claimants fleeing the war, he regretted the policies of many to deter asylum-seekers, which are short-sighted and force women, men and children to put their lives in danger, while benefiting smugglers trafficking in human beings. \"The Mediterranean Sea is an immense cemetery of shame, which is the final resting place for unknown numbers of indigent Africans and young people who only sought to improve their fortunes,\" he stressed, calling for greater international support on a political, security, financial and humanitarian level, adding that such support \"must not vary according to geography\". The right to asylum is the most symbolic of human rights, and refusing to receive asylum-seekers or discriminating against them is a violation of human rights.\n\nGENNADY V. KUZMIN ( Russian Federation ), noting that conflicts, poverty and economic inequality continue to force populations out of their countries of origin, stressed that this is due to the \"irresponsible policies of Western States\" which have imposed their dictate and carried out geopolitical experiments in weaker countries. Describing the situations in African States, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan as \"hotbeds of mass migration\", he particularly called on UNHCR to continue supporting the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to their homelands. Asserting that the Ukrainian crisis has intensified because of the unwillingness of the authorities encouraged by Western patrons to not implement the Minsk agreement, he shared that his country is making every effort to accommodate refugees, providing them with assistance in employment, education and health care. He pointed out that UNHCR staff based in Moscow have made regularly visits to temporary accommodation centres for internally displaced persons in various regions and have noted the effectiveness of their work.\n\nALBANA DAUTLLARI ( Albania ), noting that the war in Ukraine has affected more than 40 million people, said it has taken emergency response to new heights. Responding to such crises should be in \"in addition to\" and not \"instead of\" other crises, she said, adding that the international community must not forget the millions of people displaced worldwide, from Myanmar to Burkina Faso to Ethiopia to Yemen and elsewhere. The Council must continue searching for solutions by supporting countries of origin and host countries, and by ensuring that people can rebuild their lives if they make the choice to return. \"Its important to be united in giving the right signals,\" she said, adding that the Council must overcome divisions. Commending the efforts of UNHCR in meeting the increasing protection needs, she also applauded refugee-hosting countries worldwide that welcome millions and continue to demonstrate solidarity.\n\nAMEIRAH ALHEFEITI ( United Arab Emirates ), voicing concern about the numerous challenging and complex humanitarian situations around the world, including Afghanistan, Myanmar and Ukraine, said her country continues to provide humanitarian assistance worldwide, including in support of Syrian and Rohingya refugees, as well as to internally displaced persons in Ethiopia. Addressing the root causes and contributing factors of forced displacement must remain the Councils number one approach to prevent its occurrence in the first place, she underscored. To end conflicts peacefully, political solutions, dialogue and support for de-escalation must remain the building blocks of its efforts. That approach is also more efficient and cost-effective, as it ensures that the most vulnerable can remain in their homes in secure conditions, she pointed out. Recalling the RewirED Summit in 2021 in her country, she said finding new ways to provide education to those forcibly displaced can mitigate the risk of leaving them behind and build their capacities to contribute to their futures. To that end, her country has sought to invest in innovative education tools, including the Digital School launched in 2022 to train educators and provide distance learning for children, including youth in refugee camps, including in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Noting that climate change is and will continue to increase forced displacement at an alarming rate, she stressed that effective mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary to lessen the impact of climate change on forced displacement.\n\nGENG SHUANG ( China ) expressed concern about the severe lack of funding against the backdrop of growing humanitarian needs, noting that the number of forcibly displaced persons exceeded 100 million in 2022, hitting a \"record high\", adding: \"The fact that the UNHCR has had to lower its relief standards is of great concern.\" Noting that 83 per cent of refugees are supported by developing countries, he called on the international community to mobilize resources and strengthen cooperation to ensure refugees are protected. Such protection should be non-political, and the credibility of refugee status must be safeguarded. The Security Council must assume its primary responsibility of promoting political settlements and fostering a peaceful environment, through enhanced cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission, and support for post-conflict rebuilding, alleviating refugees plight and creating favourable conditions for refugees to return. Turning to Ukraine, he commended its neighbours, who host millions of displaced Ukrainians, and called on the international community to increase support to help bring about a political solution. On Palestine, he expressed concern about the millions of Palestinians who have been displaced, their homes occupied and their rights trampled on, calling on the international community to provide adequate funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and to promote a just and lasting solution to the Palestine question. On Syria, he pointed out that the 7 million refugees hosted by neighbouring countries are \"the bitter fruit of military intervention\", and called on the international community to introspect to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies. Turning to Afghanistan, where 11 million people had been displaced, millions to Pakistan and Iran alone, he called for the maintenance of a constructive engagement towards peaceful rebuilding and the return of refugees, adding that the issue of frozen overseas assets should be addressed to help Afghans out of their plight. On the Rohingya, he noted that Myanmar and Bangladesh are moving towards initial repatriation efforts towards the end of 2022, and called on the international community to lend greater support to UNHCR.\n\nRAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI ( India ), noting that the concerned States have the primary responsibility to protect and assist internally displaced persons, stressed that international action must remain within the bounds of the concept of sovereignty and should only be at the request of the country concerned. Pointing to the need to focus on preventing people from being forced to leave their homelands, he underscored that preventing armed conflicts, countering terrorism and building and sustaining peace through facilitating sustainable development and good governance remain critical. Highlighting that Member States and UNHCR must avoid politicization of the humanitarian work, he encouraged the Refugee Agency to continue to help build, strengthen and use national capacities for protection and humanitarian action. Recalling that humanitarian aid has become more important due to the global economic slowdown, he called upon Member States to provide indiscriminate and equitable services to refugees and take them into due account in national response strategies.\n\nJUAN RAMN DE LA FUENTE RAMREZ ( Mexico ) stated that violence, poverty, lack of opportunities, political instability and climate change all contribute to more people being forced to leave their homes, as is the case in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Somalia. Noting that the measures imposed in Afghanistan restricting the rights of women and girls also affect their decision to move to other regions or to leave the country, he stressed the importance of acknowledging that females are disproportionately affected by the various factors leading to displacement. He called on UNHCR to systematically include mental health services and psychosocial support in its regional and national responses. Sharing that his country is the third largest receiver of new claims for refugee status, he pointed out that 72 per cent of the claims have received a positive response. He expressed hope that the Global Refugee Forum to be held in 2023 will be a good opportunity to analyse comprehensive solutions based on recently acquired experiences to guarantee the rights of all refugees and internally displaced people.\n\nMONA JUUL ( Norway ) expressed concern about the high number of children being forcibly displaced amid the increasing number of armed conflicts around the world, noting that many of them are alone and at high risk of recruitment to armed groups. She went on to outline several negative trends that must be reversed, including warfare in urban areas, which is killing and injuring civilians, destroying homes, schools and hospitals, and depriving people of access to basic services and means of survival, adding that the Russian Federations war against Ukraine is \"a horrifying example of this\". Such challenges are compounded by climate change, environmental degradation and rising food insecurity, both as a consequence and a driver of conflict, leading to further displacement, as seen in Sahel, the Horn of Africa and elsewhere. She called for stronger political will to address root causes and prevent conflict and displacement, and for the Secretary-Generals mediation efforts to be supported. Further, parties to conflict must protect civilians and reduce the risks that drive displacement, and comply with refugee law and human rights. She stressed the need for protection to be at the core of the humanitarian response. Further, durable solutions must be sought to benefit both the displaced and their host communities. Norway supports the global compact on refugees and welcomes the Secretary-Generals Action Agenda on internal displacement and the appointment of a Special Adviser. She called on the global community to show greater solidarity through broader burden- and responsibility-sharing, and for more countries to be engaged, along with international financial institutions and the private sector. Flexible, unearmarked funding is key to meet changing and growing needs, she added.\n\nJAMES KARIUKI ( United Kingdom ), commending the efforts of UNHCR, echoed \"others horror at President Putins latest atrocities\", and noted that the crisis in Ukraine is but one example of the need to address the drivers of displacement. From Ethiopia to Syria to Myanmar, the international community owes it to the millions of refugees and displaced to find practical solutions to prolonged crises. Also calling on the Council to continue to ensure that actors on the ground meet their responsibilities to international humanitarian law, he added that this means ensuring that refugee returns are voluntary, safe and dignified, and allowing humanitarians to safely carry out their work unhindered. His country is taking lifesaving action, he said, highlighting its International Development Strategy and the plan to contribute over $3 billion to global humanitarian needs over the next three years.\n\nHAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ), Council President for November, speaking in his national capacity, expressed concern about the continuous rise in global refugee numbers, which stood at 100 million individuals in May 2022. Noting that the war in Ukraine has been a key driver, he added that in many parts of continental Africa, the situation remains dire with more than 26 per cent of the worlds refugees hosted in the region. In Somalia, the number of people displaced internally by drought in 2022 alone is nearing 1 million, in addition to those displaced due to conflict and insecurity. Highlighting the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, he encouraged Member States to implement those agreements as well as the global compact for refugees, adopted in 2018. The increasing rate of refugees on his continent requires deeper cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements, he said, highlighting continental initiatives such as the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa which came into force in 2012.\n\nMr. GRANDI, responding to questions and comments, thanked delegations who had expressed support for UNHCR, its partners and staff, and affirmed the Refugee Agencys continued work despite the challenges it faces. He said he mentioned climate change to highlight the complexity of movement and urge that those factors be considered in current discussions on the climate emergency, including at the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties. The Councils work is closely linked to that of UNCHR, he said, noting that the agency \"picks up the pieces\" when the 15-member organ does not manage to arrive at political solutions. The best way to assist UNHCR is by continuing to work on political solutions, he emphasized. Recalling his symbolic visit to Cote dIvoire on 23 June World Refugee Day he highlighted that 90 per cent of the countrys refugees had gone back after years of civil war. When positive political action happens, then solutions to displacement occur, he underscored. All people fleeing armed conflict, discrimination or persecution are equal and must be treated equally. However, there is inequality in the way victims of the worst situations are treated, he said, affirming that UNCHR will continue to remind all to uphold that principle. On the Ukrainian refugee crisis, he cited the Canadian ambassador who, at the Third Committees meeting on 1 November, underscored that the way Ukrainian refugees have been treated should not be the exception but the norm on which to build a model on hosting refugees.\n\nFurther on supporting UNHCR, humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations, he said it is also important to ensure that there is no backtracking in development assistance. Without simultaneously building resilience, refugees immunity to shocks and hardships will continue the spiral of humanitarian assistance that is unsustainable in the long-term. UNCHR is \"spread very thin\", he stressed, pointing that this is the first year in his seven years as High Commissioner that he shares the funding gap with alarm, warning of potential cuts in cash assistance to host countries. Underscoring that humanitarian access is particularly difficult in \"theatres of conflict\", he called for urgent and successful peace talks for the resumption of aid delivery. He voiced support for the carve-out initiative led by Ireland and the United States, stressing UNCHRs need for clarity and flexibility to operate in difficult political circumstances. Having to negotiate too much with whoever controls a territory becomes cumbersome, he pointed out. As such, the Councils help in that regard would be invaluable and urgent. On mental health, he said that the UNHCR Executive Committees resolution recognizes mental health as a very important part of the agencys humanitarian response given the traumatic nature of conflict.\n\nHe agreed with the need to step up efforts in Somalia, stressing the importance of collective responsibility in that regard. Voicing concern about the humanitarian situation inside Syria, he agreed that more early recovery efforts are needed, assuring the delegations of the Russian Federation and others that UNCHR will continue to talk constructively with the Government of Syria to remove obstacles that prevent people from returning. Turning to Haiti, he said he would appeal in the next few days to States receiving Haitians to not return them to the country given the extremely fragile and worrying situation. UNHCR will continue to work wherever Ukrainian refugees are present, he said, noting his forthcoming meeting with a Ukrainian refugee community in Japan. The Refugee Agency is also working with the Russian Federation in respect of Ukrainian refugees present in its territory, he said, noting UNCHRs small operation in the country. Voicing support for Chinas recommendations, he stressed the importance of creating conditions for the return of Rohingya refugees and cooperation between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Although important, dialogue alone will not guarantee their return, he pointed out, stressing that discrimination and other such concerns must be lifted for people to return. He echoed calls for support of UNWRA, noting the importance of that agencys work with Palestinian refugees.\n\nRecalling the important \"toolbox\" approved by the General Assembly four years ago, he said those tools are available to Council members and other countries to improve the response to the refugee and displacement crisis. Looking ahead, he said the Global Refugee Forum will be held again at the end of 2023, voicing hope that Member States will invest and participate in that meeting.",

The Pentagon announced a new package of $400 million in security assistance on Friday. Credit... Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON The Defense Department is setting up a new command to oversee how the United States and its allies train and equip the Ukrainian military, the Pentagon announced on Friday along with a new package of $400 million in security assistance.\n\nThe Pentagons commitment to supplying Ukraine with weaponry and the new command are clear signals that the United States expects the threat from Russia to Ukraine and its neighbors to persist for many years, current and former senior U.S. officials said.\n\nThe command will \"ensure we are postured to continue supporting Ukraine over the long term,\" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters at a news briefing. \"We remain committed to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\"\n\nIn the military, a command is a focused organization dedicated to a particular geographical or strategic area. The new command, called the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, or SAG-U, will based in Germany and within the structure of the Pentagons European Command. With a staff of about 300 people, it will be focused on one mission: to help train and equip Ukraines military.\n\nThe new command will streamline a training and assistance system that was created on the fly after the Russian invasion in February. The Times reported in September that the new structure was in the works.\n\nThe revamped assistance program will be led by a high-ranking general who will replace Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, the head of the Armys 18th Airborne Corps, who has coordinated much of the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine from behind the scenes over the past several months.\n\nA leading candidate to take over the new position is Lt. Gen. Antonio A. Aguto, Jr., the head of the First U.S. Army headquarters, located at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, military officials said.\n\nThe additional $400 million in security assistance includes, for the first time, funding to refurbish 45 tanks from the Czech Republic, which will start arriving in Ukraine by the end of December, Ms. Singh said. The funding also will go to contracts for 1,100 Phoenix Ghost drones and an additional 40 riverine boats.\n\nThe latest announcement brings to $18.9 billion the amount in military assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The funds comprise a combination of immediate shipments from stockpiles as well as contracts for weapons to be delivered over the next three years.\n\nOver the past several months, General Donahue, who commanded the American evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021, has helped oversee training in Ukraine, talking to Ukrainian generals about their battlefield needs and drawing on his Special Operations background to advise his Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nGeneral Donahue and his staff have been deployed to Poland and Germany since the early days of the war. His staff recently returned to its main headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., where they were greeted this week by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. General Donahue will remain in Germany until his successor arrives, Pentagon officials said.\n\nThe new command, which will report to Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the top American officer in Europe, will carry out the decisions made by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 40 countries that the Defense Department created after the Russian invasion to address Ukraines needs and requests. Senior military officials from the member nations met in Brussels this week.\n\nThe changes, which aim to give a formal structure to what has been improvised since the wars onset, are roughly modeled on U.S. train-and-assist efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades.",

This retreat represents a strategic recalibration following a significant Ukrainian advance and is a response to the difficulties in sustaining a military presence in Kherson (3,5).",
                "summary": "The Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region to preserve the lives of Russian soldiers and due to difficulties in maintaining supply lines to the strategic city amidst a Ukrainian counteroffensive (1). This retreat from Kherson, a significant strategic and symbolic victory for Ukraine, is seen as a substantial blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly after the annexation declaration of the region (2,3). The decision comes after Ukrainian forces have been making advances towards Kherson from two directions, making it the most notable military development since the Ukrainian sweep through the Kharkiv region in September (5). However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has approached the announcement with caution, suggesting it could be a strategic maneuver by Russia to regroup its forces (4).",
                "more_detailed": "Russia's decision to order a withdrawal of its forces from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region is a significant strategic move. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu's announcement of the retreat was driven by the intention to save the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive and the logistical challenges of maintaining supply lines to the city of Kherson (1,2,3). General Sergei Surovikin, the overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, recommended this withdrawal due to the difficulties in fully supplying and operating in Kherson, proposing to establish defensive lines on the more sustainable eastern bank of the river (3,9,10). The move is also indicative of the Russian military's recognition of the tactical necessity to regroup and fortify positions where they have a greater ability to resupply and create more sustainable defenses (9).\n\nThe retreat from Kherson, which follows Ukrainian advances and a Russian effort to relocate residents, represents a major victory for Ukraine and a significant setback for Russia, which had previously claimed the annexation of the region (2,5,7,8). While the withdrawal might serve Moscow's strategic aim of maintaining a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland, it undermines the broader goal of linking Crimea to Odessa, a key Black Sea port (9). Furthermore, the decision to withdraw could be part of a larger strategy to avoid a potentially costly and protracted battle for Kherson, which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine suggests might be a move by Russia to regroup its forces (4). Nonetheless, the retreat has been portrayed as a personal defeat for President Vladimir Putin, who had recently declared the permanence of Kherson's annexation to Russia (2)."

The withdrawal comes after Ukrainian forces advanced towards Kherson from two directions, marking this as the most significant military development since Ukraine's retaking of territories in the northern Kharkiv region in September (5). Despite the apparent Russian retreat, Ukrainian officials remained cautious, with some suggesting the possibility of a Russian trick, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty in the conflict (3).",

This decision was announced on television by both Shoigu and General Sergei Surovikin, who pointed to logistical challenges as the reason for the withdrawal, particularly in light of Ukrainian forces advancing towards Kherson from two directions (1,5). The Russian withdrawal from Kherson, the only regional capital they had captured since the invasion began in February, represents the most considerable setback for Russia since their forces were pushed back in the northern Kharkiv region in September (5,6).\n\nThe Ukrainian victory in Kherson is perceived as a substantial blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially following his announcement of the annexation of Kherson along with three other regions (1,2). The retreat from Kherson is also seen as undermining the morale of Russian forces and is considered Russia's \"biggest setback of the war\" (4). Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials remained cautious, with some suggesting the Russian retreat might be a trick, even as the Russian-installed official in southern Ukraine signaled the impending pullback and advised civilians to evacuate (3,6). The Russian forces completed their withdrawal from Kherson, retreating to the east side of the Dnieper River, a move that reverses their most significant military achievement since the war began and potentially alters the conditions for any future negotiations (10)."

                "summary": "The Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered a withdrawal of Russian troops from the city of Kherson, signaling what could be a significant shift in military tactics (5). This move follows the announcement of a retreat from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the face of Ukrainian advances and comes after a high-profile annexation ceremony led by President Vladimir Putin (1). As Russian forces empty out key institutions in Kherson and officials indicate a potential pullback, there is speculation about whether this could lead to a new defensive strategy (2,3). However, Ukrainian officials remain cautious, considering the possibility that the retreat may be a ruse, implying that the shift in tactics could also involve a psychological component of misinformation (4).",
                "more_detailed": "The recent order by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for troops to retreat to the right bank of the Dnipro River suggests a significant shift in Russian military strategy concerning the war in Ukraine, particularly in the southern region, where Kherson is a strategic city (1, 5). This move, which could result in Russia relinquishing control of Kherson, is seen as a potential major setback for President Vladimir Putin, especially after the annexation of Kherson was announced in Moscow (1). The withdrawal has been met with caution by Ukrainian officials, who are wary of Russian intentions and consider the possibility of a strategic regrouping or a trap rather than a genuine retreat (4, 7, 8).\n\nIf the Russian withdrawal from Kherson is indeed genuine, it could indicate a shift in tactics to prioritizing the withdrawal of forces in an orderly fashion and delaying Ukrainian advances, rather than attempting to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive completely (7). This could pose challenges for both retreating Russian forces and advancing Ukrainian troops, with the latter attempting to reoccupy and secure the city of Kherson and its surroundings (7). The Russian-installed official's call for civilians to evacuate could also signal a new phase in the conflict, though Ukraine claims these evacuations include forced deportations, an act considered a war crime, which Russia denies (9). Analysts imply that the new Russian tactic may involve regrouping forces to more defensible positions while managing the optics and consequences of the withdrawal (7, 9)."

The reasons behind this decision included the intent to preserve the lives of Russian soldiers in the face of a strong Ukrainian counteroffensive and the recognition of logistical challenges that were being faced by the Russian military forces. The difficulties in maintaining supply lines to the city, which is strategically located on the right side of the Dnieper River, were underscored as a key factor leading to this decision (1,2,6).\n\nThe retreat from Kherson was also seen as a move to reposition Russian forces to more defensible locations, as the city had become increasingly difficult to supply and function effectively due to Ukrainian precision strikes on bridges, depots, and troop concentrations. This withdrawal came after Moscow had previously declared the annexation of Kherson region, making the retreat a particularly humiliating setback for President Vladimir Putin. The announcement of the pullout was made via a televised briefing, which included both Shoigu and General Sergei Surovikin, the commander in charge of leading the invasion of Ukraine (2,5,6)."

The withdrawal suggests that Ukrainian forces could gain a strategic advantage, potentially using the west bank of the Dnipro as a springboard for future offensives, including towards Crimea, which is a long-term objective for Kyiv (4,10).\n\nFurthermore, the retreat could signal a shift in the dynamics of the conflict, as it might end Russian efforts to establish a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland or link Crimea to Odessa. This raises questions about the security and sustainability of Russia's strategic aims in the region (7). Additionally, the withdrawal could have repercussions for the remaining Russian-held territories in Ukraine, as it suggests that Russian forces might be vulnerable to further Ukrainian counteroffensives. Military experts and analysts anticipate that the war is far from over, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces expected to continue fighting through the winter, which could lead to additional territorial changes and challenges to the security of Russian-controlled areas (7,8)."

This retreat, particularly after Russia's formal annexation of the region, is expected to be a significant blow to Russian morale and a considerable strategic victory for Ukraine, as Kherson was the only regional capital captured by Russian forces during the war (1,4). Despite the announcement, Ukrainian officials remain cautious, considering the possibility of the retreat being a strategic deception, and they continue to closely monitor the situation for genuine Russian military movements (3). If the pullout proceeds as indicated by Russia, it could lead to a reshaping of the frontline and bolster Ukrainian efforts in their southern offensive, while undermining Russian military standing and control in the annexed territories (1,2,5).",

Should Ukraine reclaim Kherson, it could pave the way for further territorial gains in the Zaporizhzhia region and potentially facilitate a push towards Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014 (6). However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed caution, suggesting the announced retreat might be a ruse to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap (6).\n\nThe implications of the Russian pullback for both sides are profound. It could significantly impact Russian military morale and raise domestic pressure on the Kremlin to intensify the conflict (4,6). On the other hand, it offers Ukraine a strategic opportunity to advance in the south, although the Russian military presence east of the Dnipro River will still serve Moscow's strategic objectives, maintaining a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland (7). Additionally, President Zelenskyy has acknowledged the possibility that the Russian announcement could be part of a strategy to regroup forces, implying that the conflict's dynamics remain fluid and uncertain (9). The city of Kherson may transform from a potential gateway for Moscow's advances towards Odessa and the Black Sea coast into a launch point for Kyiv's counter-offensives towards occupied Crimea (10)."

But he also said, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, that at a time of his choosing, Ukrainian progress on the battlefield would come. He added that Ukrainians \"are not considering this as just one single operation.\" \"We have a strategy and different directions,\" he added.

                "cc_text": "November 8, 7:45 pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nIranian state-run outlet Nour News Agency reported that Russian National Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev arrived in Tehran on November 8, likely to discuss the potential sale of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia.[1] Nour News Agency announced Patrushevs arrival in an English-language tweet, stating that Iranian Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Ali Shamkhani invited Patrushev and noted that Patrushev will also meet with other high-ranking Iranian political and economic officials to discuss Russo-Iranian cooperation.[2] Nour News Agency is affiliated with the SNSC. The SNSC likely announced Patrushevs arrival in Iran to highlight the deepening cooperation between Moscow and Tehran to an international audience (rather than domestically), as well as to implicitly highlight that a high-ranking Russian official turned to Iran for help in Ukraine. Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani notably traveled to Moscow in 2015 to appeal to Russia to intervene in the Syrian Civil War. Tehran is likely eager to publicly signal this rebalancing of its strategic partnership with Moscow, especially to regional Iranian adversaries with which the Kremlin occasionally cooperates, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia.[3] Patrushevs visit to Iran notably comes amid reports that the Iranian regime is seeking Russian help with protest suppression, although it is unclear if this will be discussed by Patrushev and his Iranian counterpart.[4]\n\nThe Kremlin is continuing efforts to covertly acquire munitions for use in Ukraine to mitigate the effects of international sanctions and backfill Russias ongoing depletion of domestic munitions stockpiles. British outlet Sky News reported on November 8 that the Kremlin flew 140 million euros in cash and a selection of captured British-made NLAW anti-tank missiles, US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles, and a Stinger anti-aircraft missile to Tehran on August 20 in exchange for 160 additional Shahed-136 drones for use in Ukraine.[5] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on November 8 that Tehran continues to supply Moscow with Mohajer, Arash, and Shahed-type drones by air and sea via both Iranian state-owned and privately-owned entities.[6] The Ukrainian Resistance Center additionally reported that due to failures of the Russian military-industrial complex, Russian military leaders are continuing their efforts to procure dual-use (military and non-military use) goods such as computer chips, quadcopters, night vision devices, and bulletproof vests from Turkey and are using cryptocurrency transactions to avoid purchase tracking.[7] Taken in tandem, these reports indicate that the Kremlin seeks to circumvent sanctions by engaging in quid-pro-quo and under-the-table negotiations with foreign actors.\n\nWagner Group forces are continuing to exaggerate their claimed territorial gains in Donbas to further distinguish themselves from proxy and conventional Russian forces. Russian sources began reporting on November 7 that a detachment of Wagner forces and troops of the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) 6th Cossack Regiment broke through Ukrainian defensive lines in Bilohorivka, Luhansk Oblast.[8] On November 8, however, Russian coverage largely shifted and Russian milbloggers began claiming that reports of the 6th Cossack Regiments involvement in operations near Bilohorivka are false and that Wagner troops were solely responsible for purported gains.[9] As ISW has previously observed, Wagner has taken sole credit for Russian gains around Bakhmut in order to bolster their own reputation as the Kremlins favored strike force, despite not being the only force deployed in the area.[10] Wagner will likely use Bilohorivka to accomplish a similar effect.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIranian sources announcedwithout Russian confirmationthat Russian National Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev arrived in Tehran on November 8, likely to discuss the potential sale of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia. Iran likely announced Patrushevs arrival to highlight the deepening cooperation between Moscow and Tehran to an international audience, as well as to implicitly highlight that a high-ranking Russian official turned to Iran for help in Ukraine.\n\nWagner Group forces are continuing to exaggerate their claimed territorial gains in Donbas to further distinguish themselves from proxy and conventional Russian forces.\n\nUkrainian forces likely made marginal gains northwest of Svatove, Luhansk Oblast, and Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces intensified offensive operations toward Kreminna.\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and in western Donetsk Oblast.\n\nUkrainian authorities attempted to counteract Russian authorities continued efforts to strengthen control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).\n\nThe disproportionate financial burden of Russian force generation efforts continues to fall primarily on Russian regional governments budgets, prompting public backlash.\n\nFinancial and bureaucratic issues are continuing to hinder Russian efforts to replenish formerly elite units defending critical areas of the front line, potentially threatening the integrity of Russian defenses in occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nRussian occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast may be trying to force residents out of the western part of the oblast by cutting communications on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesSouthern and Eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and two supporting efforts);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces likely made marginal gains northwest of Svatove, Luhansk Oblast on November 8. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian army aviation (helicopters) struck a Ukrainian formation in Novoselivske (14km northwest of Svatove), indicating that Ukrainian troops have advanced at least as far as that point.[11] Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops attacked Novoselivske on November 7, and the Russian MoD seemingly confirmed that Ukrainian forces advanced into the settlement between November 7 and 8.[12] A Russian milblogger also claimed that Ukrainian troops attempted to attack Kuzemivka, 13km northwest of Svatove.[13]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces intensified counteroffensive operations in the Kreminna direction on November 8. Several Russian milbloggers indicated that Ukrainian troops resumed attacks towards Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast after a brief pause in operations and that Ukrainian troops are attacking Kreminna from concentration areas around Chervonopopivka, about 5km northwest of Kreminna.[14] A Russian source indicated that elements of the Russian 20th Combined Arms Army are responsible for the defense of the Kreminna area and that Russian troops are launching counterattacks in this area to complicate attempted Ukrainian advances towards Kreminna.[15] Russian forces additionally conducted a limited ground attack 10km south of Kreminna to regain lost positions around Bilohorivka.[16] Russian sources claimed that Wagner Group fighters broke through Ukrainian defensive lines in Bilohorivka, but ISW has not observed independent confirmation that Russian troops have entered or taken control of Bilohorivka.[17]\n\nSouthern Ukraine: (Kherson Oblast)\n\nRussian forces continued defensive preparations in Kherson Oblast on November 8. Ukraines Southern Operational Command reported that Russian troops are conducting active defense and trying to hold occupied positions throughout Kherson Oblast.[18] Geolocated footage and images posted to Twitter on November 8 show Russian pillboxes (concrete defensive structures) in Hola Prystan, about 8km south of Kherson City on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[19] A Russian milblogger reiterated that Russian forces maintain positions in Kherson Oblast and claimed that there are no indicators that Russian troops intend to withdraw.[20]\n\nRussian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops conducted limited and unsuccessful ground attacks throughout Kherson Oblast on November 8. Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces attempted to attack near Pravdyne (25km northwest of Kherson City), in western Kherson Oblast near the Kherson-Mykolaiv Oblast border around Sukhyi Stavok and Davydiv Brid, and in northern Kherson Oblast towards Sukhanove (35km north of Beryslav).[21] A Russian source indicated that elements of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) continue defensive operations in these areas.[22]\n\nUkrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign against Russian concentration areas in Kherson Oblast on November 7 and 8. Ukrainian military sources confirmed that Ukrainian strikes destroyed Russian equipment concentrations and significant fuel reserves in Hola Prystan and other Russian concentration areas in the Kherson and Beryslav raions.[23] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian troops launched a missile attack on Oleshky, 5km south of Kherson City.[24] Social media users posted imagery of Russian air defense activating over Kalanchak (65km southeast of Kherson City).[25]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on November 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on Bakhmut itself and south of Bakhmut near Ivanhrad (4km south), Klishchiivka (7km southwest), Mayorsk (20km south), and Opytne (4km south).[26] Spokesperson for Ukraines Eastern Group of Forces, Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty, stated on November 8 that the Bakhmut-Avdiivka-Vuhledar line is the hottest area of the front, and that Wagner Group troops comprise the majority of Russian strike groups in the Bakhmut direction.[27] A Russian source reported that Russian forces have made little to no progress on the Donetsk Oblast front line, specifically near Soledar, due to Ukrainian resistance.[28] Russian forces continued routine shelling along the line of contact in the Bakhmut area.[29]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area on November 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults in Krasnohorivka (on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City) and Marinka (on the southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City).[30] A Russian source published video footage on November 8 of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) \"Sparta\" Battalion flag raised in the vicinity of the Donetsk City Airport and claimed that DNR forces took the area on November 7.[31] Russian milbloggers additionally claimed that Russian troops conducted assaults on Ukrainian positions in Krasnohorivka and Marinka and broke through Ukrainian defenses in Vodyane (on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City).[32] Russian forces conducted routine shelling in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area.[33]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast on November 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults in the areas of Pavlivka and Vodyane (both about 50km southwest of Donetsk City).[34] The Russian MoD claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attacked twice toward Novomykhailivka and Pavlivka, and Russian sources amplified reports of fighting in these areas, with further claims that Ukrainian forces are deploying additional units to the area to hold the line.[35] A Russian source claimed that Russian losses in the Pavlivka area are much more severe than figures reported by the Russian MoD and stated that soon there will be no more Russian tanks left. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces continued routine shelling along the line of contact in Donetsk Oblast and eastern Zaporizhia Oblast.[36]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued routine air, missile, and artillery strikes in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, and Mykolaiv oblasts on November 8.[37] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces continued to strike Nikopol, Hulyaipole, and other settlements along the contact line in Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhia oblasts over the past day.[38] Ukraines Southern Operational Command notably reported that a Russian Su-35 fired a Kh-31 missile (a high-end and scarce precision munition) at a Ukrainian air defense system the Bashtansky Raion of Mykolaiv Oblast on November 8 but missed.[39] Ukraines Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukrainian forces safely destroyed the remnants of a Russian anchor mine that exploded on the coast of Odesa due to a storm.[40] The presence of a Russian anchor mine off the coast of Odesa indicates that Russian forces are continuing efforts to limit Ukrainian movement along the Southern Axis and in the Black Sea. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces destroyed a Ukrainian rocket and artillery ammunition depot near Kushhove, Zaporizhzhia Oblast (northwest of Orikhiv).[41] A Russian source also claimed that Russian air defense systems in Sevastopol shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Black Sea on November 8.[42]\n\nUkrainian authorities attempted to counteract Russian authorities continued efforts to consolidate control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) on November 7.[43] Ukrainian nuclear power company Energoatom reported on November 7 that it will increase the salary bonus from 20% to 50% for Ukrainian ZNPP employees who remain loyal to Ukraine.[44] A Russian milblogger called Energoatoms move to increase salaries \"bribery\" and an \"act of sabotage against the restoration of peaceful life.\"[45] Meanwhile, the Zaporizhzhia Oblast Military Administration reported on November 8 that Russian occupation authorities continued to collect personal data, check private smartphones, enter private residences, and illegally detain Ukrainians in Enerhodar, likely to continue expanding social control over the economically vital ZNPP and its surroundings.[46]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nThe disproportionate financial burden of Russian force generation efforts continues to fall primarily on Russian regional governments budgets rather than the federal budget, prompting public backlash. Russian-language outlet Important Stories reported on November 7 that Russian federal subjects have spent 12.8 billion rubles (roughly 210 million USD) to pay mobilized personnel, but that most federal subjects did not allocate enough money to distribute promised one-time enlistment bonus payments.[47] The lack of payments has sparked protests in the Chuvash Republic and Chelyabinsk Oblast, as ISW has previously reported.[48] Public backlash and local protests prompted Russian officials from Perm Krai, the Chuvashia Republic, Omsk Oblast, and Russian-occupied Sevastopol to announce that they will distribute payments. Regional heads blamed incomplete records of mobilized personnel and implied that they always intended to provide the payments, which will likely strain local budgets.[49]\n\nFinancial and bureaucratic issues are continuing to hinder Russian efforts to replenish formerly elite units defending critical areas of the front line, potentially threatening the integrity of Russian defenses in occupied parts of Ukraine. A Russian source claimed that a St. Petersburg volunteer for the 76th Guards Airborne Assault Division, a formerly elite unit, was registered as a mobilized soldier rather than a volunteer, thereby only entitling him to a 50,000-ruble payment rather than the 100,000-ruble payment for volunteers.[50] The source also claimed that nine other volunteers of the division were similarly mislabeled.[51] The 76th Airborne Division is currently defending the front line in Kherson Oblast, where Russian forces desperately need more bodies who are willing to fight or provide cover during a controlled withdrawal.[52]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of occupied and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast may be trying to force residents out of the oblast by cutting communications on the west bank of the Dnipro River following the end of mass public evacuations to the east bank. A Russian military correspondent in Kherson City claimed on November 8 that there is no internet in Kherson City and that phone lines work only intermittently.[53] Russian occupation authorities may intend a prolonged communications blackout to further coerce residents to leave Kherson City and to prevent residents from informing Ukrainian forces of the military situation if they choose to stay. An advisor to the Ukrainian Kherson Oblast Military Administration head, Serhiy Khlan, stated that occupation authorities in Kherson City, Kakhovka, and Nova Kakhovka collect the personal information of residents who did not evacuate, including their addresses and reasons for not evacuating.[54] Occupation authorities will likely use this data to further coerce cooperation with the occupation administration as long as Russian forces continue to hold those areas. The Russian deputy head of the Kherson Oblast occupation administration, Kirill Stremousov, claimed that residents can still evacuate \"privately\" and that evacuation is not mandatory, contradicting the head of the Kherson occupation administration, Vladimir Saldo, who stated on November 1 that evacuation of residents within 15km of the Dnipro River was mandatory.[55]\n\nRussian authorities are continuing to import Russian citizens to serve in occupation administrations, replacing possibly ineffective Ukrainian collaborators and personnel from the Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics (DNR and LNR) in occupied parts of Ukraine. DNR Head Denis Pushilin announced on November 5 that First Deputy Chairperson of Yakutia and former Mayor of Irkutsk, Dmitry Berdnikov, became the deputy occupation head of Mariupol.[56] Pushilin stated that Mariupol \"needs more intensive actions\" to provide the city with necessary provisions, which suggests that Russian authorities may believe existing Ukrainian collaborators are not trustworthy or effective enough to accomplish the Kremlins objectives in occupied parts of Ukraine.[57] Ukrainian Mariupol Mayoral Advisor Petro Andryushchenko claimed that Berdnikov will effectively replace the occupation head of Mariupol, Kostyantyn Ivashchenkoa Ukrainian collaborator appointed directly by the DNRas part of ongoing tensions between Pushilin and the Russian government.[58] The Kremlin is likely asserting increasingly direct control of occupied Ukrainian territory, removing local collaborators or DNR- and LNR-appointed officials.\n\nThe Ukrainian Prosecutor Generals Office reported on November 8 that Russian documents left behind in Izyum, Kharkiv Oblast, show that Russian authorities in occupied Ukraine plan to send high-performing Ukrainian students to an educational camp in Crimea and higher institutions in Belgorod Oblast under the guise of \"care and recreation.\"[59] ISW has previously assessed that the deportation of Ukrainian children likely amounts to a deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign, in addition to an apparent violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.[60] Russian occupation authorities may also be attempting to \"brain drain\" Ukraine by deporting promising Ukrainian students to Russian-run institutions further from the frontlines.\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

So, this afternoon at Howard University, the President will thank will thank staff, volunteers, and everyone who helped ensure everyone could make their voices heard in the midterm election.\n\nAs you heard him say yesterday the President, \"With their vo-\" \"With their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are.\"\n\nAnd while we dont know all the results just yet, we do know that states across the country saw record voter turnout, and voters also spoke clearly about their concerns from fighting inflation to addressing crime to protecting our democracy and the right to choose. These are issues the President has been laser-focused on from day one, and remain top and it will remain top priorities for him.\n\nAnd as he said yesterday as well, no matter what the final tally in all these races will be, he is prepared to work across the aisle to deliver for the American people. Thats what people want, and thats what the American people deserve.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to my colleague, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who is going to talk through the Presidents upcoming travels.\n\nJake?\n\nQ Are you all right? Whats happened to you?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Its been a long couple of days, my friend. (Laughter.)\n\nGo ahead, Jake.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Good afternoon, everyone. Ill take a few minutes to walk through the trip over the next several days, and then Ill be happy to take your questions. And I would just ask for your patience, because theres quite a bit to get through, given an action-packed schedule that the President has across three stops over a week.\n\nBefore I get into the Presidents travel across North Africa and Asia, I want to provide a brief update on our efforts to ensure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.\n\nToday, the United States will be announcing another package of security assistance for Ukraine, including important air defense contributions like missiles for HAWK air defense systems, as well as four U.S. Avenger air defense systems that come equipped with Stinger missiles.\n\nThis equipment will complement other air defense contributions announced by our allies and partners in the context of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that Secretary Austin chairs.\n\nWhen I was in Kyiv last week, I had the chance to consult directly with President Zelenskyy and his team on the ground about what Ukraine needs to be in the strongest position possible on the battlefield. This increased air defense will be critical for Ukraine as Russia continues to use cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones to attack critical civilian infrastructure.\n\nWith that, let me turn to the trip.\n\nAs you all know, tonight, the President departs for Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where tomorrow he will participate in the COP27 climate conference and hold a bilateral meeting with President Al Sisi.\n\nThe President heads to COP27 with historic momentum on climate, thanks to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and other significant steps that put us on an enduring path towards meeting our ambitions and clean energy goals.\n\nWhile hes on the ground, hell speak to his personal commitment to addressing the climate crisis. Hell highlight some of the progress the United States has made both here at home and in rallying action on climate around the world. And hell underscore the need to go further, faster, to help the most vulnerable communities build their resilience without losing sight of the need for the world, and particularly for the major economies, to cut emissions dramatically in this decisive decade.\n\nWhile in Egypt, President Biden will also meet with President Al Sisi, as I mentioned, to discuss a number of critical regional and bilateral issues, following on his visit to the Middle East earlier this year, where he also had an opportunity to sit with President Al Sisi.\n\nOn Saturday, hell arrive in Cambodia and attend the U.S.-ASEAN Summit. Hell reaffirm the United States strong support for ASEAN centrality and build on the achievements of the historic U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit that was held in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. He will also hold a bilateral meeting with 2022 ASEAN Chair, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen.\n\nOn Sunday in Cambodia, he will participate in the East Asia Summit. He will underscore U.S. support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture in the Indo-Pacific and discuss opportunities to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific that is more connected, more prosperous, more secure, and more resilient.\n\nHell also hold bilateral and trilateral meetings with the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of Korea in light of the continuing nuclear and missile threats posed by the DPRK, as well as growing alignment among our countries in promoting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOn Monday, President Biden will be in Bali, Indonesia, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. He will thank President Widodo for his leadership, his chairmanship of the G20, and highlight the growing importance of the U.S.-India [sic] Strategic U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership.\n\nLater in the day on Monday, President Biden will hold a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. This is the first time that President Biden and President Xi will have had this is the first time that they will meet face-to-face since President Biden became President.\n\nPresident Biden has made it a priority to keep lines of communication open with President Xi to responsibly manage the competition between our two countries, and he believes there is no more important channel than that between the leaders of the United States and China.\n\nFrom day one of the Biden administration, our approach to the PRC has followed the same fundamentals: invest in the foundations of our strength here at home; align our efforts with a network of allies and partners; and compete responsibly to defend and advance our interests and those of like-minded nations.\n\nThe meeting between President Biden and President Xi will be an in-depth and substantive opportunity to better understand one anothers priorities and intentions, to address differences, and to identify areas where we can work together, because working together to address common problems is in our interest and because it is what the world expects of responsible powers.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will attend the G20 Summit where hell focus on a range of pressing global economic challenges, especially for emerging and vulnerable economies, including energy security and the clean energy transition, food security, debt relief for low- and middle-income countries, multilateral development bank reform, and the launch of a pandemic preparedness fund.\n\nHe will also rally likeminded nations to speak out forcefully against Russias illegal invasion in and illegal war in Ukraine, which has exacerbated many of these challenges.\n\nPresident Biden will join with fellow G7 and G20 leaders to host an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, PGII, where the U.S. and other partners will announce a series of high-impact infrastructure projects across the developing world.\n\nThe President will have the opportunity to hold a number of other bilateral meetings on the margins of the G20, and well announce those in due course. Among others, we expect that hell have the chance to sit for the first time with the prime ministers of both the United Kingdom and Italy the new prime ministers who have both recently taken office.\n\nThis trip comes at an important moment. President Biden heads off with the wind at his back. The United States has helped rally the world to oppose Russian aggression in Ukraine. We have built a strong foundation of engagement with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. We have launched impactful new initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, including PGII and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Were leading collective efforts on climate, health, food and energy security. And weve made far-reaching foundational investments in our industrial and innovation base and in modernizing our infrastructure here at home.\n\nSo we believe that we are in a strong position to both navigate competition and to work with partners to solve the great challenges of our time. Thats what President Biden intends to do on this trip.\n\nAnd thank you all for your patience, and I look forward to answering your questions.\n\nYes.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. In the briefing we had earlier about the Xi meeting, there was a mention of some proposals on areas where there could be some collaboration. Was that specifically regarding tariffs and trade negotiations? And will there be any progress on that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I dont think you should look at this meeting as one in which theres going to be specific deliverables announced. Rather, the two leaders are going to give direction to their teams to work on a number of areas, both areas where we have differences and areas where we can work together. That will include direction to the economic teams to address our concerns about Chinese economic practices and to deal with some of the underlying differences of view and perspective on economic matters.\n\nIt will also involve giving direction to try to work on issues on which we do have common interest, whether its health, counternarcotics, climate, or other areas.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ So, a two-part question on the Asia trip. First off, what impact does the midterm elections have on the Presidents ability to deliver on, you know, American commitments overseas? And, secondly, now that Xi is through the congress in China, does that affect his willingness to work with the United States or embolden him to, you know, conflict with the United States more? What impact do you think that could have?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, when it comes to the President leaving after the results on Tuesday and the incoming results that continue to flow in, he feels very good about where things stand, and he feels like he is going out on this trip with the wind very much at his back. And that gives him an excellent opportunity both to deal with competitors from a strong position and to rally allies.\n\nAnd as far as the continuing support of the United States for critical foreign policy initiatives, the President was clear yesterday, and he will be very clear on the trip, that there will be strong, enduring, unflagging, unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russias aggression.\n\nThere is a bipartisan basis and foundation to our approach to China. And he looks forward to working with both parties on that issue, whatever the final composition of the two houses of Congress are.\n\nBut in general, he goes out on this trip feeling like the results from Tuesday show that the American people,\n\nyou know, are sending him out onto the world stage in a very strong position.\n\nQ And on the China issue, what impact does the you know, Xis new term in the Communist Congress what impact does that have on their willingness to work with the U.S., do you think?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: That remains to be seen. And part of what the President is eager to determine is: In a face-to-face meeting where for the first time since hes come into office, President Biden has come into the presidency, he will get to sit in the same room with Xi Jinping, be direct and straightforward with him as he always is, and expect the same in return from Xi. And then he can make his judgments on that basis about how to take things forward.\n\nThats why this meeting is extremely important. There just is no substitute for this kind of leader-to-leader communication in navigating and managing such a consequential relationship.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Jake, thanks so much for doing the briefing. I want to ask you about Brittney Griner and then President Putin more broadly. But shes been moved to a penal colony and apparently hasnt been seen for six days. What can you tell us about her condition? When is the last time that U.S. officials had any kind of update on her condition?\n\nAnd what is your level of optimism that now that we are past the midterms, President Putin will be more potentially serious about negotiating her release?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So I have to protect the confidentiality of our dealings with her family and some of our consular dealings with Russian officials. But I will tell you, on a daily basis, our embassy in Moscow is focused on ensuring that Brit- they are on top of Brittney Griners condition, location, and how the Russian government is treating her.\n\nShe is being held unjustly. She should be released immediately. We have made that clear to our Russian counterparts. And we have put forward a series of proposals over the last several months for how we could resolve her case, as well as the case of Paul Whelan, to bring them both home. So far, the Russians have not shown a willingness to engage in in that back-and-forth to produce a result.\n\nAs President Biden said yesterday, we are hopeful that we can renew that dialogue and find a way to get these cases resolved and to get both Brittney and Paul home.\n\nI cant handicap it. I cant give you any predictions. All I can tell you is President Biden is personally engaged on this. I am personally engaged on this. We are dealing with the Russians at very senior levels, and our diplomats on the ground are working overtime to ensure that they are staying in close touch with their Russian counterparts on her case.\n\nQ And I know President Biden got a version of this yesterday, but if you could just help us understand this moment right now and what it means. The fact that Russia has pulled out of Kherson, is the U.S. encouraging Ukraine to now start peace talks with Russia? Is there any sense that that might actually happen? And does it lower your concern or does it impact your concerned at all about Putins potential use of a nuclear weapon?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, this is a significant military milestone for the Ukrainians if, in fact, it happens that Russia follows through and withdraws to the far side of the Dnieper River. Of course, were going to watch actions, and not just announcements, to see what actually unfolds.\n\nBut if this does come to pass, that will mean in the Battle of Kyiv, in the Battle of Kherson, in the Battle of Kharkiv, the Ukrainians will have prevailed against an invading marauding force that conducted an illegal war in their country.\n\nBut, of course, its not the end of the war. As Russia continues to occupy parts of Ukrainian territory, we are continuing to support the Ukrainians in their effort to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nAnd as the President said yesterday, were guided by a very simple principle: \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" It is ultimately up to Ukraine to make determinations about its diplomatic course. It is our job to put them in the best position on the battlefield so that when and if there is an opportunity for diplomacy, theyre in the best position at the bargaining table. I dont have anything to offer you today about the likelihood or the proximity of any kind of negotiations.\n\nRight now, what the Ukrainians are focused on is defending their critical infrastructure against these barbaric attacks that are killing civilians and harming, you know, the basic functioning of the economy, and trying to take their territory back.\n\nThe United States is not pressuring Ukraine. Were not insisting on things with Ukraine. What we are doing is consulting as partners and showing our support not just through public statements or moral support, but through the tangible, physical support of the kind of military assistance I mentioned before.\n\nQ Thank you.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Just a quick follow-up on Kherson, first. You said that youd be watching actions instead of just hearing what theyre saying. Do you have any indication that a withdrawal has actually started?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We do see some indications of movement consistent with what the announcements were yesterday. But this is an involved operation. The Russians had flowed a significant number of forces and personnel into Kherson city and to the west side of the Dnieper River. So its not the kind of thing you just snap your fingers and its done. So we will want to see how it actually unfolds in the coming days before we make any judgments about whether the Russians are fully fully following through on the announcement they made, or whether theyre going to choose to change course at some point. And well continue to stay in close touch with the Ukrainians on that as well.\n\nQ And to follow up on Kristens questions about Griner forgive me if Im wrong, but I didnt hear whether you have a condition for her a current condition, how shes doing since shes been transferred to the colony.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Sorry, at the start of my answer to Kristen, what I said is, to protect confidentiality, Im not going to speak to her condition from the podium today.\n\nQ And I have one more question, unrelated. Sorry.\n\nThe President yesterday said that it should be that Elon Musks acquisition of Twitter should be looked into as a potential threat to national security. Can you offer anything about why? And he also said there are many ways to look into that. How would you look into that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, you heard the President yesterday, and the CFIUS process is the normal process through which transactions that might have a national security nexus get reviewed. And I will defer to the CFIUS process rather than comment on it further from this podium.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. At the G20, would it be better if Putin was there? I mean, hes arguably the most consequential player on some of those big issues that are going to be discussed: food security and energy security.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, youll have to ask President Putin and the Kremlin why hes decided not to go, as it appears he has decided not to go. Its not really for me to comment on.\n\nWhat I can say is that President Biden is going to advance an affirmative agenda on all the issues that I laid out, and hell do that regardless of whos sitting in the chair on the Russian side.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Can I ask, then, on China? Can you give an update on the, kind of, efforts that were launched before, about a sustained dialogue on risk reduction the strategic stability talks? Where do those stand? What what has been the impediment to try to get those risk reduction talks going?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, we do believe that with the U.S. and Chinese militaries operating in proximity to one another in the Indo-Pacific and in many different areas of the Indo-Pacific, its important to have channels of communication between our militaries so that we can avoid accidents, miscalculation, escalation, and we can avoid having anything that might tip over into conflict. That, to us, is important that type of communication and that type of engagement.\n\nFurther, weve expressed our concerns about aspects of strategic stability in the context of China, as we have in the context of Russia. And weve indicated that good, substantive dialogue between significant countries like the U.S. and China can help produce greater stability over time.\n\nIm not going to get ahead of the conversations between the two presidents. These topics, of course, will be touched on. What comes of that in what form, over what time, with what participation I wont get ahead of it today.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake. The President said yesterday that he found it interesting that Russia waited until after the midterm elections to announce this withdrawal from Kherson, the implication being that Russia was held off on withdrawing to have some kind of effect on the midterms. So was the President just speculating there, or do you guys have any evidence to back that up? And then I have a Griner question.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think the President what the President said should be taken at face value. He thought it was interesting timing that they you had the election on November 9th November 8th, and on November 9th they made the significant announcement on Kherson. And Ill\n\nQ So theres no evidence\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: And Ill just leave it at that.\n\nQ beyond that? And then on Brittney Griner\n\nQ Jake. Thank you, Jake.\n\nQ on Brittney Griner, what given that the President said that he would be open to meeting Putin to discuss Brittney Griners situation, would the President be willing to meet with the Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, at the G20 to discuss Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Theres no plans for the President to meet with the Russian Foreign Minister.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nQ So I want to ask you about Lebanon. Do you think this administration will deal with any elected president in Lebanon is backed up from Iran and Syria?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, I dont want to get ahead of you know, make ca-\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I dont want to make categorical statements because well have to see what comes out of the democratic process in Lebanon.\n\nWhat I will say is that the President did directly engage with President Aoun just a couple of weeks ago, in the process of bringing to conclusion a historic and significant maritime agreement involving Israel and Lebanon.\n\nSo we certainly believe its in the United States national security interest to have a relationship with the government of Lebanon because we think that that can help with regional security, with Americas security, with Israels security, and, ultimately, with the security and prosperity of the people of Lebanon.\n\nBut but Im not going to respond to hypotheticals about a president who doesnt yet (inaudible).\n\nQ Sorry, one more question. Hezbollah has been obstructing justice regarding the investigation of the Beirut explosion, and its allies as well. What is the administration doing to push that forward? We have over 226 victims, and no one really revealed any truth about this big tragedy.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: It continues to be the focus of the U.S. government, as it has been from the day that President Biden came into office, to try and drive towards answers and accountability when it comes to that explosion. And well continue to work that as actively as we possibly can.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Thank you very much, Jake. Questions about Brazil. After (inaudible), after Asia, are you going to Brazil to meet with the President-elect Lula?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So we havent finalized plans, but I have been in touch with senior members of the president-elects team because we want to be able to coordinate very closely with them. Whether that involves me going down there or some folks coming here, were still working out.\n\nBut I think that you can expect face-to-face engagement at high levels between the incoming team and our team so that we can hit the ground running once President-elect Lula becomes president in January.\n\nQ And just quick a follow-up. What kind of challenges do you see with the new government of Brazil? For example, related to the Russia war in Ukraine, Lula said he will be able to talk with Russia and Ukraine to try to end the war. What do you think about that?\n\nAnd today, Secretary Kerry met with Lulas team, and they discussed help to protect the Amazon. What kind of assistance is the United States considering?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, President Biden has had a very longstanding view that it is the obligation of the United States and other major economies to help Brazil protect its rainforest. The same goes for other countries with significant rain forests, like Indonesia. And so, hes going to look for an early opportunity to sit with the incoming president, who has expressed a real commitment and motivation to protect the Amazon, and talk about a variety of forms of assistance we can give not just technical assistance, but financial assistance as well. Thats something President Biden sees as a real priority.\n\nAnd with respect to Russias war on Ukraine, President Biden had an opportunity briefly to speak with the president-elect shortly after his victory, and they agreed that they would talk in detail about all of these issues, including the Ukraine issue, when they have the chance to meet in person.\n\nIm not going to get ahead of that conversation, as I think the two of them should have the chance to talk before I characterize it.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ General Milley yesterday had a pretty staggering assessment of the casualties from Russ- of Russian casualties in this war so far, saying that 100,000 have been wounded or killed. Can you discuss what impact is this having on Putin domestically in terms of support for this war? And just how long do you think Russia can keep operating at this casualty rate?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, the numbers are really quite striking, and were talking about just an immense amount of suffering on the part not just of those who have died or been injured in the war in Ukraine, but their families and their communities across Russia.\n\nAnd one of the reasons why we believe that Russia should end this war and leave Ukraine is for the good of those families and communities inside Russia. It is difficult at the moment for us to characterize the internal political situation inside Russia.\n\nFor one thing, youve got the tight control of the Kremlin on the communications apparatus and on the political apparatus in that country. For another, all of us in this room see surprises in our own domestic political context. So trying to, you know, be effective armchair analysts of another countrys political process is something we should have significant humility about.\n\nBut we are watching closely for these impacts economically, socially, and beyond, because you simply cannot visit upon your country this level of suffering without it having reverberating impacts of various kinds. So, we will have to see how that unfolds.\n\nQ And how long do you think they could keep operating at this level of casualties?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, first, its clear that the fact of Russian military losses on the battlefield is having an impact on their ability to hold territory in Ukraine. Weve seen that in Kharkiv. Weve seen that in the announcement that they have made about Kherson. So, its having an impact.\n\nBut the larger \"how long\" question is not one that I can, you know, put a timetable on because war is inherently unpredictable. And so all we can do is continue to try and make sure that, for our purposes, were giving Ukraine what it needs to do its part. And then, we will, of course, analyze how Russia is postured and positioned as we go forward.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ Yes. So, I wanted to ask two questions about the meeting with President Xi. One, yesterday, the President did not commit to telling President Xi that they would or the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily. How should Taiwan be interpreting that answer?\n\nAnd secondly, the Treasury released a report today saying that or criticizing China for not being more transparent about its foreign exchange policy, and explicitly calling it a \"failure.\" Will the two leaders speak about that tomorrow as well?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, on your first question, as many of you know, having seen President Biden go into consequential meetings with foreign counterparts, he doesnt like to characterize what hes going to say to them. He likes to actually go say it to them.\n\nAnd as for how Taiwan might react to that, well have the opportunity, as an administration, to brief Taiwan on the results of that meeting. And Im confident that they will feel very secure and comfortable in the United States position when it comes to our support for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act, which does commit the United States to ensuring were providing the articles for Taiwans defense.\n\nYeah.\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Oh, and you asked about the FX report. I would just say that this has been a longstanding concern of the United States. Its been reflected in previous reports. It doesnt come as a significant surprise, but it is an area of significant concern for the United States.\n\nAnd I cant tell you, standing here today, whether that particular topic will come up among the wide range of things we have to discuss with the PRC.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Two questions. On Egypt, can you give us a little bit of details about the bilat between the President and President Sisi? Is regional security one of the issues going to be discussed?\n\nAnd on the meeting with Xi Jinping, can you give us some kind of assessment of how do you see Russia position vis--vis sorry, Chinas position vis--vis Russia? Do you think that you are able to neutralize them from supporting Russia so far? And what more do you think that the President can raise issues to make sure that they will stay the way it is and not involved with the war in Ukraine?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, on the PRC, we have not since President Biden and President Xi spoke some months ago seen the PRC providing military equipment, weapons for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. And we have not seen the kind of wholesale efforts to backfill or undermine the sanctions regime, though, of course, the PRC has continued its economic relationship with Russia over the course of the past many months.\n\nOne other positive signal that we have seen was during the recent visit by the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to the PRC: the statement on nuclear weapons and Xi Jinping, specifically talking about the need to avoid the use of or even the threat of the use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. And in that context of that conversation, we regarded that as constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, we believe that, of course, every country in the world should do more to prevail upon Russia, especially those who have relationships with Russia, to end this war and leave Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden will have the opportunity to talk in detail about the Ukraine crisis during his meeting with President Xi.\n\nOn the meeting with Sisi, it will cover a range of issues issues between the U.S., in terms of our strategic partnership, as well as issues in the region. And that includes, of course, Egypts role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict President Biden and President Sisi engaged directly last year during the conflict in Gaza; ongoing efforts to deal with both Gaza and the West Bank that Egypt has a stake and role in, and theyll discuss that. Theyll discuss whats happening in Yemen, where Egypt also has an important role to play, as well as a number of other critical issues in the area.\n\nQ Thank you. Thank you, Jake. I have two questions. North Korea has criticized the recent cybersecurity conference held by the United States when the President Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had this meeting. Will the two leaders discuss North Koreas cyber hacking, include nuclear issues?\n\nSecond question: Do you think North Korea will conduct its seventh nuclear test during the G20 and ASEAN Summit? If so, how will you respond?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, weve been very transparent about our concern with North Korea that the DPRK would conduct its seventh nuclear test at some point in this broader timeframe. And by \"broader,\" I mean weve been talking about this now for a couple of months. That window still remains open. Our concern still remains real. Whether it happens in the next week or not, I cant say.\n\nWe are also concerned about further potential long-range missile tests in addition to the possibility of a nuclear test.\n\nAnd so, well be watching carefully for both of those. We are in very tight coordination with both the ROK and Japan. And the trilateral meeting that the three leaders will be able to have on the margins of the East Asia Summit, I think, will be a significant milestone in the trilateral relationship and will help only strengthen coordination on DPRK.\n\nYes, I do think that the broader threat posed by North Korea in the cyber domain will be a topic of conversation between the President of the ROK and the President of the United States.\n\nQ A question on India?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yeah. On India. And then Ill do one more. Yeah.\n\nQ Thank you very much, sir. My question is on U.S.-India relations. President Biden has good relations with many global leaders around the globe. They can pick up the phone and call to each other.\n\nHe has similar relations with the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.\n\nAnd second, sir second part of the question is if President Biden is visiting India anytime soon. Because 1.3 billion people are waiting to welcome him. And at the same time, if Prime Minister Modi is visiting the White House. Thank you, sir.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, India is the president of the G20 next year. So, President Biden certainly will intend to be a participant in that G20. I dont have anything to announce about visits prior to that, to India, or visits to the White House.\n\nBut I would point out Prime Minister Modi has already been to the White House since President Biden took office, and the two of them have had the opportunity to meet in person multiple times and to talk by phone multiple times and to talk on video multiple times.\n\nWhen you add all that up, it is a productive, very practical relationship between these two leaders who see common interests on a number of critical issues and have really worked together to strengthen the U.S.-India partnership. And President Biden is looking forward to seeing Prime Minister Modi at the G20 this year, as well as we look ahead to next year.\n\nAnd Ill take the last question.\n\nQ Thank you, Jake. Two quick questions. One, you mentioned sort of a robust agenda for Biden in his bilat with Sisi. Does he intend, though, to bring up human rights and specifically call for the release of jailed activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah? Is that is that part of his agenda with Sisi?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So as President Biden, I think, has said to many of you, he feels youre not the American President youre not really doing your job as the American President if youre not raising issues of human rights. So you can expect that he will raise human rights issues in that meeting, as he will with other leaders that he encounters at the G20.\n\nOn the particular case of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, we have been in high-level communication with the Egyptian government on this case. We have deep concern about it. We would like to see him freed. We have had discussions through very senior channels. And I think you can expect that those conversations will continue on the ground in Sharm el-Sheikh, when we get there.\n\nThank you.\n\nQ Jake just real quick on Xi Jinping and the meeting there. Bid- President Biden has obviously met with him many times in the past. Some of the success of those meetings was seen to be a little bit of open-ended and sometimes informalities. This will be different. But is there anything that you guys are doing to try to recreate those, sort of, more informal exchanges that the two of them had? Or is this, sort of, a meeting set up with many people alongside each side of the table that makes those types of informal discussions more difficult?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So the current setup of the meeting is one in which each of them will meet alongside their teams. But even in instances on video conferences, where each leader has had their team with them, the hallmark of their engagement no matter whos in the room is one where they dont just read talking points, they dont just kind of march methodically through each of their scripts; they actually do have a robust back and forth. And its on the bigger picture: Where is this relationship headed? Where is the PRC headed? Where is the U.S. headed?\n\nAnd especially at this moment, as the President comes out of these midterms, as Xi Jinping comes out of the 20th Party Congress, that bigger-picture conversation is probably the most important element of this meeting. Thats what the President has on his mind going in. And I think for that reason, it is going to be an important and, in my view, highly constructive contribution to how we manage this relationship going forward.\n\n(Cross-talk by reporters.)\n\nSorry, guys, I got to go.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks, Jake.\n\nOkay. Can do another, like, 15 minutes. Chris, you want to kick us off?\n\nQ Sure. A question about cryptocurrencies. (Inaudible) the administration has seen those things crash. And, you know, should regulators be taking a harder look at these things to protect investors at this point?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So Im not able to comment on it on what specific actions independent regular- regulators should or should not take on this particular issue. But what I can say is the administration is aware of the recent developments on this, and well just continue to monitor the situation.\n\nQ Should the administration do legislation you know, new things that should be done to protect people?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the administration, as you know, Chris, has consistently maintained that without proper oversight, cryptocurrencies they it risks harming everyday Americans. So this is something that, clearly, we monitor and that we see as an important important issue.\n\nBut the most recent news further underscores these concerns and highlights why prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies is indeed needed. The White House, along with the relevant agencies, will, again, closely monitor the situation as it cont- as it develops.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ One just a quick follow-up on foreign policy first. Kevin McCarthy has said that he would love to lead a congressional delegation to Taiwan. Im just curious if you would discourage him from doing that if he becomes Speaker.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thats not something Im going to speak to about. As you know, when you all were asking us about the Speakers travel, we did not comment about her travel. Were certainly not going to do that with Kevin McCarthy.\n\nQ Okay. And then, just on the CPI statement this morning from the President: Most of the increase that we saw in inflation last month was due to rising costs for shelter. President Bidens statement didnt mention that. What is the administration doing to contain the rampant run-up in rents right now?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Of shelter specifically?\n\nQ Shelter costs, yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I dont have anything right now to share with you on that specific piece of the data.\n\nAs you know, the report the way that we saw it, and as the President says, it shows that we are making progress, which is important as we talk about CPI, on bringing inflation down.\n\nAs you know, inflation has been a number-one top priority when it comes to the economy those lowering costs for the American people. And so, without driving without giving up all of our progress, clearly, that we have made with the economy when we look at the job the labor market, the job creation.\n\nSo the prese- the Presidents economic plan, as we know as we see it right now, because of this data and many other pieces of data that we have seen we are seeing some strength, and it continues to grow. And we were put in a situation to manage to manage our economy through these global challenges.\n\nSo, again, we think that the data that we saw with CPI is a is a step forward. The President clearly is going to continue to do the work to bring down cost for the American people. We talked about the gas prices and also Inflation Reduction Act. So that will continue to be.\n\nBut that particular piece of the data, I dont have anything to share with you on that.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. President Biden yesterday drew some red lines on issues where he will not compromise with Republicans: Medicare, Social Security, a national abortion ban. He also did say that he would be willing to compromise with Republicans on some other issues, but he didnt say which ones specifically. So what are the areas where you guys do see room for compromise with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, the results are all the results are not in yet, so dont want to get ahead of that. And well have a better sense, hopefully in the next couple of days, if not the next couple of weeks, of, you know, what the Congress the complexion of the Congress is going to look like.\n\nI think what the President was trying to say is that the American people made themselves very clear. You know, the last couple of months, youve heard the President lay out the stark contrast; he laid out the choices that the American people had to make just a couple of days ago and they were very clear about that which is making sure that we continue to lower costs; making sure that we do not repeal Inflation Reduction Act; making sure that we continue to deliver for the American people; making sure that lets not forget democracy was also a choice that the American people made.\n\nAnd so thats what hes talking about. Hes talking about the basically, the wins that we have been able to deliver for the American people. Hes not willing to roll that back.\n\nAnd as we know, congressional Republicans made themselves very clear, leading up to Tuesday, that they were going to roll back Medicare, they were going to roll back Social Security not even roll it back, just cut it all off right? chop it out.\n\nAnd so the President is saying hes just not willing to do that. And lets not forget these are issues that the American people see as very popular and important to them. So thats what hes talking about.\n\nQ I understand you dont want to get ahead of the results, but it was the President who said yesterday that hed be willing to compromise on certain issues. So has he not thought through what those issues would be? Its just a general statement?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No no, I hear your question. Youre saying hes been willing to compromise. But at the same time, we have to see what the results are.\n\nAnd of course hes going to say that; hes the President of the United States. Of course hes going to say, \"Im willing to work with the other side.\" Were talking about President Biden, who has done that. He also laid out that he has since his administration, in the past 20-plus months, he has passed 200 bipartisan laws will sign 200 bipartisan laws.\n\nAnd so he is saying that hes willing to work with the other side, as he has said before. But we you know, once we know what were working with in the next, hopefully, you know, couple of days, if not longer, then hell well have those conversation and can talk more.\n\nQ And then quickly on democracy. The President yesterday talked about, you know, this being an example that democracy works. He really emphasized that. I think hes expected to talk about that later today, as well.\n\nI know that you guys have pointed to some statewide races where some prominent election deniers did not win. But I believe, at the latest count, at least 145 election deniers running for the U.S. House have won their races.\n\nSo, given that, how does the President assess the state of U.S. democracy and the health of that democracy when so many election deniers are being elected to Congress a majority of the Republican caucus?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, the President has been very clear that he still sees that he believes our democracy is still under under threat and that the American people have to defend it. Thats something that hes going to continue to say. And the part of that is rejecting election lies or those who would use violence to overthrow democracy.\n\nAnd so you did see that from the American people. But, again, its still under threat. It one election will not change that. Right? And so theres still work to be done. Theres still work to strengthen our democracy, and theres still work to protect our democracy.\n\nAgain, its not going to happen under one election or even 2020 election. Right? Weve continued to work towards that.\n\nOkay, Mary.\n\nQ Can I follow up on that real quick?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Ill come to the back in a second.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Can you describe more of the Presidents phone call yesterday with Leader McCarthy? He noted they dont have much of a personal relationship, so how did it go? Did he get a sense that there are areas where they will be able to compromise, going forward?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Im not going to get into into more details onto into their private conversation. Im sure I think Im sure Leader McCarthy will have more to say on his end.\n\nBut look, I think the way to look at the conversation and the President speaking with Kevin McCarthy is that he is willing, as he said yesterday, to work with with folks on the other side of the aisle, as he has in the past. Hes willing to do things in a bipartisan way. This is a President who has who has made that a priority, not just as President but as Vice President and also as senator.\n\nAnd so hes just as long we are delivering for the American people, that is something that he wants to see. And weve done that. Lets not forget the the gun legislation. We saw movement on guns in that we hadnt seen in 30 years. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation. The CHIPS and Science Act. The PACT Act to actually really give us some relief, some healthcare to our veterans.\n\nSo theres ways that we can work together. But well see. You know, well see what that what the agenda will be.\n\nQ And is the President going to go down to Georgia to lend some support to Raphael Warnock in this runoff? Is that under consideration?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I dont have anything for you right now to speak to, but clearly, the President will do whatever Senator Warnock needs him to do to help him win. The DNC made significant investments in Georgia this year. But again, I dont have anything right now to lay out as far as any travel that the President will be making.\n\nQ Has Warnock made a request?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I actually have not I have not heard of a request. I just dont have anything to share on that.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Israel follow-up?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: And Ill come to the back.\n\nQ Karine, thank you so much. The President is obviously going to this climate summit, to COP27. How does he reassure leaders, given that he is anticipating a Republican Congress, that any new agreements that they come to will be carried out here, will be codified if need be, given that hes got to reach across the aisle with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Say that last part. How can he\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: How does he reassure the leaders that whatever new agreements they reach there will be carried out, will be codified here, given that we are expecting that he will be working with a Republican-led House?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I think I mean, this is a President who has been in front of world leaders, who have who has traveled abroad, as you know, multiple times in the past 20-plus months of his presidency and, lets not forget, as Vice President and, lets not forget, as senator.\n\nSo he has, as we know, a lot of respect for some of these leaders. He has very close relationships with many of these leaders. He has done business, if you will, and talked about really key important issues over the last few years, if not decades. So I think theres a level of trust and understanding on how this works.\n\nAnd, you know, I I also feel as if I also think that we dont want to go too far right? because were still waiting on results. Were still waiting on what will happen with with Congress, both the Senate and the House.\n\nBut again, it was a good night for Democrats. It was a historic night for Democrats. And like Jake said just from here, just moments ago, the President goes into you know, goes to Asia with the wind at his back. And its not the first time. One of the last times he went, it was the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. You know, there are wins that he they have seen us deliver on. And so I think theres there is a level of trust with this particular President.\n\nQ I just want to ask you one quickly on the economy. Inflation not as high as was expected, but we are hearing about these layoffs at these major companies, Meta and Twitter. What is the message to American companies who are concerned that those layoffs could be a sign that the economy could be headed toward a recession?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So we are aware of the layoffs at Meta and other other tech companies that you just laid out, Kristen. I dont have a comment on the moves announced by Meta today, specifically. But more broadly speaking, the most recent jobs and CPI report the one from today suggest that the U.S. economy continues to grow, and its also adding jobs, which is incredibly important.\n\nAnd Americans are begin- beginning to see a much more needed break in inflation. So that does matter. If you just look at CPI, lets not forget the GDP, where we saw the last quarter we saw the economy grow by 2.6 percent. All of this all these data points matter as to how were how were growing and where were headed in the economy.\n\nQ Youve said several times from this perch right here that the White House wants to remain independent from the Justice Department. I cover the Justice Department at DOJ. Those folks will say, \"We want to stay totally independent.\"\n\nI know Jake was asked earlier by Weijia about this comment with Elon Musk and having people its worthy of looking into Elon Musks relationship with other businesses. He talked about CFIUS. CFIUS is made up of the Treasury Department and DOJ officials. The President has been criticized in the past for talking about the Department of Justice and looking into people relating to January 6th subpoenas. What did he mean what does that mean when the President says \"worthy of being looked into\"? Its raising some questions.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, just answered that question. Im just not going to go beyond that. He is he is, as you know, the advisor to the National Security Council. Im just not going to go beyond that.\n\nAnd as the President said, and as I have said many times, we just refer you to the committee. I dont have anything else to add.\n\nQ And, Karine, one follow-up. I wanted to ask Jake this. When the President meets with President Xi its their first time meeting in person since President Biden took office when he comes back, I know its too early to tell if Republicans are going to take control the Senate, of the House. If so, even if one body if they want to investigate and when I say \"they,\" I mean Republicans the origins of COVID-19 thats something Republicans have on their agenda; theyve been talking about it will President Biden ask President Xi about the origins of COVID-19 and bring up that issue with him in person?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Again, Im not going to get and Jake has said this as well Im not going to get ahead of the agenda of what theyre going to discuss when they have their bilat.\n\nCertainly, we will share the conversation and what came up. The President has always been clear on getting to the bottom of COVID and has been very clear in reports that we have put out on the origins of COVID as well, but Im just not going to get ahead of that conversation.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. The President said yesterday, \"Im not going to change anything in a fundamental way.\" But the Presidents approval ratings are still low, with an overwhelming majority of voters in exit polls said the country is headed in the wrong direction, especially on the economy. So is how is the White House sort of squaring those two things? Is is there no change needed, I guess, in terms of satisfying those voters who are saying that they think the country is headed in a wrong direction?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, we think that well, let me step back for a second. What the President was talking about then he wasnt going to renegotiate renegotiate things that have already passed, right?\n\nYou think about the Inflation Reduction Act, and you think about what thats going to do for the American people lowering costs, which is something that he has said is going to be a priority for him. And continuing to do that lowering healthcare costs, lowering energy costs, which he also said this yesterday American people are going to feel early next year, which is just a few weeks away, a couple of months a month or two away.\n\nAnd so thats what when we talk about that, Republicans were very clear: They wanted to repeal that. They wanted to take away the Inflation Reduction Act. And so thats what the President was talking about, making sure that we do not take away the things that the things that we have been able to accomplish, the successes that we have been able to see for the American people.\n\nLook, I know youre talking about the Presidents poll. But the thing about it is: When you look at these pieces of legislation, when you look at the work that we have done, when you look at the issues that the President has worked on, theyre all popular. When you think about abortion rights and you think about how how how that was a top priority for the for the American people, that is something the President is working on.\n\nYou think about inflation: Yes, the American people are feeling that every day, but the President has also worked on these issues. And those are the things hes not going to stop on. Those are things hes not going to pull back on. Trying to lower gas prices as another example of the things that hes done.\n\nQ A question in the back?\n\nQ Israel?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible.)\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Prior to the election, the President said that he would send a bill that would codify Roe v. Wade to Congress if Democrats gained two seats. At best, he may only gain one seat in the Senate, so is it still his intention to send a bill to codify it?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So I Ill say this: Whats clear in this weeks election what we saw on Tuesday is that Americans dont want to see a constitutional a right that they had for 50 years taken away. They made that very clear. We saw that in California, Vermont, Michigan when they enshrined abortion rights in their own state from voters. We saw in Montana and Kentucky where they rejected measures that would have restricted access to reproductive care. So they made their voices very, very clear. They want to see their their access to reproductive care protected, and they want to see Roe codified. And were going to do everything that we can to make that happen from here.\n\nAgain, we have to see what the results are. I know that you just laid out that we potentially could pick up have have the Senate by one, but we just have to see what the complexion of Congress is going to look like, and then well well move forward from there.\n\nQ Is there anything else that the President thinks he can do if there is only one seat in the Senate? Codifying Roe would be difficult. So is there anything else to ensure abortion access (inaudible)?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, you know, the President has certainly taken actions from the federal government, with his the HHS Agency and Department of Justice. Weve laid out executive actions that the President has taken. Were always looking to see what else we can do.\n\nBut, again, I mean, the President has always been very clear: In order to really make sure that we protect womens rights, we have to take action on the legislative level, and hes going to do everything that he can.\n\nLets not forget, people have said he wasnt going to get the bipartisan infrastructure legislation done. He got it done.\n\nPeople didnt think he was going to get the CHIPS and Science Act done. We got it done.\n\nPeople didnt think we were going to get the guns legislation done in a bipartisan way. We got that done. That was after the last time that we were able to do that was 30 years ago.\n\nSo we have been able to get things done, and thats because of this Presidents leadership. So, again, were going to continue to focus on that and make sure that we actually, you know, deliver for what the American people want from us.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Hey, Karine. Can I ask specifically about an area of compromise that has interest from different groups? Does the President see marriage equality as a potential where that he and the Democrats can work together with Republicans?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, again, not going to get ahead of what of what what the next couple of weeks are going to look like as far as an agenda. Clearly, marriage equality is something thats important to the President; he has been a leader of, and a strong ally for, the LGBTQ+ community. And he has spoken to the importance of moving that piece of legislation forward. And so, of course, were going to continue to work on that.\n\nBut Im not going to get ahead of what our agenda is going to look like before we actually know what the Congress is going to going to be.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thanks, Karine. Given the underperformance of candidates who were backed by the former President Trump, what does President Biden believe that says about Trumps standing in the Republican Party?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, meaning like the basically, the candidates that he put forward?\n\nQ Correct.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So and the President has said this you heard him say this many times over the last especially the last several weeks is that the election was a choice, not a referendum. As the President said, again, through throughout the fall, so Republican candidates said their top priority was undoing the Inflation Reduction Act, which would raise prescription jobs [costs], which would raise energy costs and also healthcare costs. And so they were very clear on how they were going to lay out ways that it would hurt the economy, worsen inflation.\n\nAnd so Democrats ran on an agenda that was going to deliver for the American people.\n\nWe believe that choice was very, very clear for the it was made very clear for the American people. And what we saw was that the American people rejected the MAGA extremism, and they voted for democracy as well.\n\nAnd so, I cant speak to, you know, what what what the you know, what the candidates or what the Republican Party feel about their leader.\n\nBut what I can speak to is what we ran on and what we laid out, and what we heard from the American people on what was important to them and what we can speak to with what congressional Republicans were trying to do, which is take us back, which is take away peoples rights. And the American people responded.\n\nQ But but, I mean, specifically Trump-backed Republicans. Does the President think that, you know, their losses show that he is losing power within the GOP?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I cant speak to the support that he has or doesnt have. What I could speak to and as youre asking me about the particular you know, the folks that he backed, they were extreme. Right? They were MAGA extremists. And thats what I mean, right? They were people who wanted to take away our freedoms, take away our rights, as we talk about abortion and, you know, codifying Roe.\n\nThey were folks who wanted to just pull back and take away the Inflation Reduction Act actually take that away, something that was incredibly historic. They wanted to do the opposite of what were trying to do, which is deliver for the American people. They had extreme views, even on as election deniers even on democracy.\n\nYou heard the President deliver very strong strong remarks on democracy not too long ago. And so, he laid that out, what we were seeing from these particular extreme candidates.\n\nAnd, you know, thats what we can speak to. And I think thats what the American people decided on. And thats the stark the stark differences that the American public saw.\n\nQ And one quick one on China that I meant to ask Jake, but I didnt want to ask him four questions. (Laughter.) So, on that briefing call, an administration official said that one of the main objectives is to deepen their understanding of each others priorities, with a goal of reducing misunderstanding and misperceptions. What do you think are some misconceptions, misperceptions, misunderstandings that China has about the U.S.?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, I dont I dont want to get into deep specifics. You know, I think you guys have followed the relationship between the two leaders over the last 20-plus months.\n\nLook, I think whats important to note is that and we youve heard us say this too the President really think its important to have that face-to-face, leader-to-leader conversation. And and, you know, the President and Xi has spoken, I think, about five times which weve all read out to you when they have spoken and this will be the first time theyll be in person.\n\nAnd it you know, we believe the President believes it is critical to build a floor for the relationship and ensure that there are rules of the road that bound our competition. But building a floor is not just about that, its also ensuring that we also are working together on areas where our interests align, especially trans- transnational challenges that affect the international community.\n\nSo, there are a lot of things that I think that they are going to discuss. This will be, again, their first meeting in person. But dont want to characterize that meeting too much because I want to make sure that the leaders the two leaders, the President and President Xi, have an opportunity to have a really in-depth conversation and talk about the interests that matter to both of them.\n\nQ Karine, Israel?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Karen. And then Ill go to the back.\n\nQ Karine, if you could just talk a bit about the lame duck Congress session right now. Beyond the must-do items that Congress has to do, like funding the government, what are some of the top items on the wish list right now for the administration that you want to do while you still have the House and the Senate?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, the President is going to look for is looking forward to talking to both Democrats and Republicans once those results are in. Of course, the President believes we should get government fund- keep the government funded, right? thats going to be an important priority including what we need to respond to the to disasters; continue to defend democracy in Ukraine, as you heard from Jake talk about our commitment to Ukraine; and fight new COVID variants. So those are the things, clearly, that are a priority for this President.\n\nAnd we should pass the overdue marriage equality bill, as I was just asked just seconds ago; pass the Electoral Reform Act and the Defense Authorization bill, as well, which should include Senator Manchins permitting bill. And we need to finish confirming the judicial nominations he made earlier this year.\n\nSo those are the things that we believe thats important to work on. Again, we look forward to discussing this with Democrats both Democrats and Republicans, once we know once the results are in.\n\nQ And how about something big on the debt ceiling, as some Democrats are calling for right now?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, you know, its again, its premature to say what the complexion of the House is going to look like. But the President is looking forward to having those discussion you know, priorities with Democrats and Republicans, as I was just saying; their congressional leaders. The debt limit should never be a matter of political brinksmanship, as youve heard us say.\n\nThe President looks forward to working with Congress to responsibly address the debt limit before its expiration. But again, were going to were going to see the results once they come in. And he looks forward to having those conversations with leaders from from both sides.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nQ Thank you. You talked a little bit earlier about a list of what the President was able to do versus what he wasnt able to do. And for those especially in the African American community who helped win take Biden to the presidency, when you talk about going forward in these next couple of years, do you think, given those who are recently elected, that youll have more or less ground when it comes to issues of criminal justice reform and voting rights?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, as you know, when it comes to those two issues voting rights, criminal justice reform that is something that the President sees as a priority. And when it comes to the Black community, the President has seen their issues as a priority as well. Right?\n\nI think everything if you think about everything that the President has done, you think about the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, you think about the American Rescue Plan, you think about CHIPS the CHIPS and Science Act, you think about the Inflation Reduction Act, all of those pieces of legislation that are now law had what we believe equity at the center of it. Right?\n\nThe President says all the time he wants to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because he does not want to leave anyone behind. He wants to make sure if you think about the American Rescue Plan, he wants to make sure that people are able when he put that forward that people were able to hold on to their homes, that people were able to start small businesses; investing in HBCUs, in education, when you think about the student loan debt debt forgiveness policy. All of those things are meant to help families in the African American community but also just Americans across the board.\n\nAnd so that is something that the President has done to make sure that we dont leave anyone behind.\n\nBut to your question about criminal justice reform and also voting rights, yes, that is something thats a priority that we need to make sure that we dont leave anyone behind.\n\nBut to your question about criminal justice reform and also voting rights: Yes, that is something thats a priority that we need to make sure that we work towards getting getting those pieces of legislation done. And the President is going to continue to work with Congress.\n\nQ Really quickly: For the states who you talk about the infrastructure bill for the states who did not use the money the way they that that the that the Biden administration wanted them to\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: You mean the American Rescue Plan?\n\nQ Im sorry, the American Rescue Plan. Forgive me. American Rescue Plan. Do you think that they have even hurt how some Re- some pe- Americans who were not in favor of Democrats or in favor of Biden and gave him low ratings, do you think that might have hurt? Because even though the money was passed, it wasnt spent like they thought it was going to be spent in their communities, and so that judgment came right back on the President.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Im let me see if I understood what you just laid out. So the American Rescue Plan, yes, there are some states that have not used the funding to its to its full capacity\n\nQ Exactly.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Right? I understand that.\n\nAnd we have always encouraged those states and worked closely with local officials and and state state officials to see to make sure, to encourage them to use those those funding, because theyre meant for everything that I just laid out. And so thats something that were going to continue to encourage, continue to have those conversations.\n\nI didnt quite get where you were what was the second part of your question?\n\nQ Well, because many Americans may not have seen\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, I see.\n\nQ what they thought, that that also may have even hurt Democrats.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I mean, I cant I cant speak to that, because Ive not seen that the data on that. But, look, I think its unfortunate I think its unfortunate if local officials or state or state officials refuse to use the funding that was provided through the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWe have to remember what was in the American Rescue Plan. Lets not forget the Child Tax Credit that helped lower poverty among children. We cannot forget how it helped small businesses get going again. We cannot forget how it opened helped open schools. When the President walked in, there were more a majority of schools were shut down.\n\nSo there are there was so much in that American Rescue Plan that met the moment. And it is unfortunate if if politicians use that in a political way, if elected officials use that in a political way, and not give that service that was provided this funding that was provided to their constituents. Because, again, the President is not a President for blue states or red states. He says this all the time: Hes a President for all Americans.\n\nIm going to take one more. Im going to take one last question.\n\nQ Karine, you said in the back (inaudible) question.\n\nQ Who did you call on?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Inaudible). You.\n\nQ Me?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ Whom exactly Jake has been talking to at Kremlin during the last month? And what exactly was the aim of these talks? Was it avoiding escalation or maybe mutual mutual recognition? And or maybe are these talks aimed to lead to something more for example, the negotiations?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we I think youre talking about when Jake was the reporting.\n\nQ During the last months.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. So, you know, I think youre talking about the negotiations that people are saying right? that has been reported.\n\nSo, you know, people claim a lot of things about the conversations that the United States has. I dont have any specific conversations to read out to you at this time.\n\nAnd but, you know, we reserve the right to speak directly at senior levels, as you have heard Jake say just just moments ago, about issues that concern the United States.\n\nBut we want to be very clear: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. It is it is it is something that the President has said; it is something that we take very, very you know, we take we see that as a very important strategy moving forward.\n\nThis is Ukraines decision when it comes to any type of negotiations. We see our part in making sure that we strengthen, you know, through we strengthen their their you know, their part in this, whether it is making sure that they have the security assis- the security assistance to defend themselves, as they have been very bravely, or when its time, when they choose, to to negotiate.\n\nBut again: Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So Ill leave it there.\n\nThanks, everybody. Thank you.\n\n2:04 P.M. EST",

The world is watching to see if Russian forces actually retreat.\n\nThe top U.S. military officer says a withdrawal has already begun.\n\n\"Right now, the early indicators are they're doing what they say they're doing and we're seeing those early indicators,\" Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday at The Economic Club of New York.\n\n\"I believe they're doing it in order to preserve their force, to reestablish defensive lines south of the river, but that remains to be seen.\"\n\nHere is a look at what this latest move in more than eight months of war means.\n\nRussia's war is going poorly\n\nThe announced withdrawal from Kherson comes after Russian troops were rapidly driven out of the Kharkiv region two months ago. The loss of Kherson would leave Russia with few territorial gains since its Feb. 24 invasion. The military campaign failed in its initial strategic objective of replacing the government in Kyiv with one friendlier to Moscow. Russia only managed to seize Mariupol by destroying it. Gen. Milley called the Russian invasion a \"tremendous strategic mistake.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Metin Aktas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHe says the U.S. believes more than 100,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded so far in the war. He added that the casualties on the Ukrainian side are probably similar. Neither Russia or Ukraine have disclosed their exact casualty numbers.\n\nMilley estimates that the withdrawal of approximately 30,000 Russian soldiers stationed in and around Kherson will take weeks. This week, Ukrainian forces blew up the only road bridge linking the city to the east bank of the Dnipro.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he welcomed the withdrawal from Kherson but is waiting to see what actually happens on the ground.\n\n\"It is encouraging to see how the brave Ukrainian forces are able to liberate more Ukrainian territory, the victories, the gains the Ukrainian armed forces are making belongs to the brave, courageous Ukrainian soldiers,\" Stoltenberg said as he left a meeting with new British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\n\"But of course the support they receive from the United Kingdom, from NATO allies and partners is also essential,\" he added, vowing that support will continue.\n\nPresident Biden remarked on Moscow's announcement, telling reporters it shows the Russian military's having \"some real problems.\"\n\nBut he added, \"It will lead to time for everyone to recalibrate their positions over the winter period. And it remains to be seen whether or not there'll be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia.\"\n\nThe fight for Kherson, and the rest of Ukraine, is far from over\n\nEven as Russia announces this withdrawal, satellite imagery shows Russian forces digging extensive trenches and other fortifications further east in the Kherson region, open source intelligence analysts say.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ashley Chan/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images Ashley Chan/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThe order from Moscow is also only to pull back to the east bank of the Dnipro River. After the early stages of the war when Russia attempted to overrun areas with tanks and infantry, this conflict has been dominated by artillery. Even after Russian troops withdraw to the opposite bank of the river, they will still be able to fire mortars across the water if Ukrainian forces try to take up positions inside the city itself.\n\nWestern military analysts say Russia is very concerned about Ukraine pushing much farther east into the Kherson region, as Russian supply lines from Crimea would then be vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery attacks.\n\nAnd even as Russia is pulling back on the southern front, fierce battles continue around Donetsk in the east. Ukrainian military officials claim to be killing hundreds of Russian troops per day, primarily in the fighting in the eastern Donbas region. On Wednesday, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had \"liquidated\" 740 troops over a 24-hour period. Those casualty numbers haven't been independently verified.\n\nIt's a morale boost for Ukraine\n\nFor months, Russia has been steadily losing territory that it seized early in the war. That includes major Ukrainian victories retaking the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKherson is one more major city that's slipping out of Moscow's control.\n\nFrom a Ukrainian perspective, it's significant that this is happening before winter. Ukrainian officials have voiced concern about the difficulties of carrying out an offensive in the snow.\n\nThey are being cautious about the announced retreat, saying they'll believe this move when they actually see it.\n\nBut Ukrainians took to social media to celebrate the Kherson withdrawal as another significant win and evidence that the war is moving in the right direction for Ukraine.",

Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin publicly endorsed the evacuation of civilians from parts of Ukraine's southern Kherson region on Friday, the latest sign of Russia's retreat in one of the most bitterly contested areas in Ukraine.\n\n\"Now, of course, those who live in Kherson should be removed from the zone of the most dangerous actions, because the civilian population should not suffer,\" Putin told pro-Kremlin activists as he marked Russia's Day of National Unity.\n\nMoscow has already been ferrying people out of an area it controls in Kherson on the west bank of the Dnipro River, and this week announced that the evacuation zone would also include a 15 km buffer area on the east bank. But the comments appear to be the first time Putin has endorsed the evacuations personally.\n\nRussia says it has been taking residents to safety from the path of a Ukrainian advance. Kyiv says the measures have included forced deportations of civilians, a war crime, which Russia denies.\n\nPutin's comments came amid signs Russia could be preparing to abandon its military foothold on the west bank of the Dnipro River, including Kherson's regional capital - potentially one of the biggest Russian retreats of the war.\n\nOn Thursday, Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed occupation administration in Kherson, said Russia was likely to pull its troops from the west bank. In later remarks, he was more equivocal, saying he hoped there would be no retreat but \"we have to take some very difficult decisions.\"\n\nLate on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the fiercest fighting over the last week had taken place around Bakhmut and Soledar, in the eastern Donetsk region about 500 km northeast of Kherson.\n\n\"We are holding our positions in these and a few other areas in the Donetsk region,\" he said in a video address, accusing Russia of insane stubborness for sending \"tens or hundreds of thousands more people to the meat grinder.\"\n\nDuring the day Ukrainian forces had downed eight Iranian drones and two Russian missiles, Zelenskiy said.",

                "cc_text": "KYIV, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Ukraine's defence minister said on Thursday it would take Russia at least a week to withdraw its troops from the southern city of Kherson and that winter would slow down battlefield operations, giving both sides a chance to regroup.\n\nIn an interview in Kyiv, Oleksii Reznikov said Russia had 40,000 troops in Kherson region and that it still had forces in the city, around the city and on the west bank of the vast Dnipro River despite announcing their retreat.\n\n\"It's not that easy to withdraw these troops from Kherson in one day or two days. As a minimum, (it will take) one week,\" he told Reuters, saying it was difficult to predict Russia's actions and that Kyiv was focused on its own plan.\n\nRussia announced on Wednesday it would withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro that includes Kherson city, the only regional capital Moscow has captured since invading Ukraine in February.\n\nReznikov said that such an exit would free forces from both sides to fight elsewhere and suggested Russia could beef up its units in the neighbouring region of Zaporizhzia that has also been partially occupied for months.\n\n\"The winter will slow down every activity on the battlefield for all sides ... It's beneficial for all sides. You will have a rest,\" he said.\n\nHe predicted Ukraine would come out of the hiatus strong, reinforced by thousands of soldiers being trained in Britain.\n\n\"We will use this time with a maximum result for our armed forces, for regrouping, for refreshing and for rotation and we will prepare them well.\"\n\n'CRAZY' IDEA\n\nSpeaking in Kyiv's heavily guarded government district, Reznikov played down the threat of a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine and dismissed as \"crazy\" the idea Moscow might blow up the vast southern Kakhovka dam as it withdraws.\n\nHe said that such a move would flood areas controlled by Moscow and also cut off their access to fresh water supply via a canal from the Dnipro to annexed Crimea.\n\n\"If you check the landscape in this district, you will find that the western bank is higher terrain and the east bank is lower terrain,\" he said.\n\n\"This means the water will flow east of this bank and they will have a risk for their troops,\" he said.\n\n[1/2]Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov talks during an interview with Reuters in Kyiv, Ukraine November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Murad Sezer Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBoth sides in the conflict have accused the other of planning to destroy the dam.\n\nOn the nuclear threat, he said it would be neither pragmatic nor practical for Russia to resort to a step that would risk souring relations - and trade - with countries like India and China.\n\nHOPES OF RUSSIAN INFIGHTING\n\nReznikov was appointed defence minister in November 2021, just a few months before Russia's invasion.\n\nBespectacled and jovial, the ex-lawyer had a professorial air despite his military-style clothing.\n\nUkraine, he said, had built up a security and defence force of 1 million personnel to guard what he described as Ukraine's \"non-friendly\" 2,500-km border with Belarus, Russia and occupied Ukrainian areas.\n\nHe said that if - or when - Kyiv's forces reach the Dnipro River in Kherson region, they would still not be able to hit the Russian-annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with their U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other weaponry.\n\nHe said he believed Russia's annexation of Crimea, which Kyiv vows to reverse, would eventually be resolved without fighting, possibly as a result of Russian infighting.\n\nReznikov accused the new commander of Russia's invasion forces of carrying out a \"doctrine of terrorists\" by heavily bombarding civilians and critical infrastructure.\n\nHe also said that the Russian army under General Sergei Surovikin appeared to have become more disciplined since his appointment in October.\n\nAsked if Moscow's tactics had changed under Surovikin, Reznikov said:\n\n\"Yes, he changed it because he's using terrorism tactics against civilians and infrastructure objects using cruise missiles, rocket missiles and drones, special Iranian drones.\"\n\n\"They don't send to Ukraine one or two rockets as before; they use 40 in a day and then wait - and then again, and again,\" he said.\n\nWriting by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

In modern times, the river divides western Ukraine from its eastern part, which has been heavily populated by Russians.\n\nNo wonder then that crossing the river which flows through Ukrainian territories before flowing into the Black Sea in the Kherson region held more than a symbolic meaning for Russian forces.\n\nFor some Russian hardliners, the Dnieper crossing also meant keeping alive the dreams of recreating the old Russia of the Tsarist days considered the golden period of the country.\n\nBut in recent days, Russian forces have appeared to be slowly retreating from their positions in Kherson city centre, located on the west bank of the river in Kherson, forcing military analysts into a guessing game about Russias real intentions. Kherson, a strategic region, forms a land bridge between the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and the Russian mainland.\n\nThere were reports on Friday that Ukrainian forces entered the city centre.\n\n\"Looking at the current tactical operation situation, it does make sense for Russians to regroup in the eastern side of the river where they have more ability to resupply and basically dig in and create more sustainable defensive positions,\" says Andreas Krieg, a defence analyst, referring to the Russian withdrawal from Kherson.\n\nRussias new military commander Sergei Surovikin, a hardliner known for his aggression throughout his career, ordered the retreat from the regional capital to maintain control over the rest of Kherson.\n\nHaving parts of Kherson east of the Dnieper River will still serve Moscows strategic aims to keep a land bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland. But it might also end Russian efforts of linking Crimea to Odessa, a Black Sea port of Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "By Euronews with AFP, AP, Reuters\n\nHere are the latest news developments from Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n1. Anger over Kherson 'expulsions' amid caution over Russian 'withdrawal'\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUkraine has said it \"strongly condemns\" what it calls the \"expulsions\" of residents from the regions around Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, accusing Moscow of carrying out \"forced mass displacement\".\n\n\"The Russian occupation administration has begun forced mass displacement of residents\" of the Kherson region, especially Skadovsk and Kakhovka, to Crimea or to Russia, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian officials and Western analysts remained cautious about signs that Russia may be abandoning the area.\n\nA Russian-installed occupation official in southern Ukraine said on Thursday Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, signalling a huge retreat that, if confirmed, would be a major turning point in the war.\n\nKyiv said it was still fighting in the area and was wary that Moscow could be setting a trap by feigning a pull-out.\n\nThe capital of the Kherson region is the only major city Russia has captured intact since its invasion in February. It also includes one side of a huge dam across the Dnipro which controls the water supply to irrigate Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces could retake Kherson from Russian troops, in what would be a major defeat for Moscow.\n\n\"On the issue of whether the Ukrainians can take the remaining territory on the west side of the Dnipro river and in Kherson, I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that,\" Austin told a news conference at the Pentagon.\n\n\"Most importantly, the Ukrainians believe they have the capability to do that. We have seen them engage in a very methodical but effective effort to take back their sovereign territory.\"\n\n2. 'No sign of undeclared nuclear activity', says UN watchdog\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog says it has found no signs of undeclared activities at sites in Ukraine that Russia alleged were being used to prepare a so-called \"dirty bomb\".\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its inspectors had been \"given unfettered access\" to the locations in Kyiv, Zhovti Kody and Dnipro.\n\n\"Based on the evaluation of the results available to date and the information provided by Ukraine, the Agency did not find any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the locations,\" the IAEA said in a statement.\n\nThe inspectors also collected environmental samples for analysis that can shed light on past and current activities related to the handling of nuclear materials, the statement said.\n\n\"Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,\" said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.\n\nHis team would report on the sampling results as soon as popssible, he added, saying the IAEA was ready to conduct further verifications.\n\nInspectors were dispatched rapidly despite \"challenging circumstances\" posed by the conflict, Grossi said.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted his gratitude for the watchdog's \"excellent and prompt cooperation which helped counter Russian falsehoods. Russia has confirmed its status of the worlds top liar.\"\n\nVladimir Putin and other senior figures in Russia alleged without providing evidence that Ukraine was manufacturing an explosive device which can scatter radioactive material across a large area.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWestern countries have called Moscows claims \"transparently false\", while Ukrainian officials say Russia is seeking justification for escalating hostilities.\n\n3. Russian top brass met to discuss using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, US claims\n\nTop Russian military brass held talks on when and how the Kremlin might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, multiple US outlets have reported, causing consternation amongst Kyiv's western allies.\n\nIt is unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin participated in the discussions.\n\nWashington has \"grown increasingly concerned\" about a potential Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine, the White House stated.\n\n\"We still have not seen any indication that the Russians are making preparations for such use ... but this is all deeply concerning to us,\" John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said on Wednesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We have grown increasingly concerned about the potential as these months have gone on,\" Kirby added.\n\nPutin recently denied having any intentions of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine but described the conflict as part of alleged efforts by the West to secure its global domination.\n\nSpeaking in late October, Putin said it is pointless for Russia to strike Ukraine with nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin said an earlier warning of his readiness to use \"all means available to protect Russia\" did not amount to nuclear sabre-rattling but was merely a response to Western statements about their possible use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We have maintained, I believe, an appropriate level of concern about the potential use of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine to include nuclear weapons,\" Kirby told reporters\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn recent weeks, Moscow has amped up its claims that Kyiv is preparing a nuclear \"dirty bomb\" attack, with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said to have made calls to his western counterparts to discuss the issue.\n\nThe move was widely seen by analysts as a possible means of distraction while the Kremlin prepared its own false flag operation.\n\nClaims that Russian troops were conducting \"secret construction\" at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine -- Europe's largest atomic energy facility -- further exacerbated fears of nuclear foul play.\n\n4. Moscow and Washington continue to trade barbs over alleged bioweapons\n\nMeanwhile, the UN Security Council overwhelmingly rejected Russias attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the US are carrying out \"military biological\" activities that violate the convention prohibiting biological weapons.\n\nRussia only received support from China in the Wednesday vote on its resolution, with France, the UK, and the US voting \"no\" and the 10 other council nations abstaining.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 2-3-10 vote reflected the councils continuing opposition and scepticism about Russias actions since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.\n\nThe council has been paralysed from taking any action against Russia's military offensive because of Moscow's veto power.\n\nRussias UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzya accused Washington of conducting work in Ukraine with deadly pathogens including cholera, plague, anthrax, and influenza.\n\nHe said documents and evidence recovered by Russian authorities suggested a military application.\n\nHis US counterpart Linda Thomas-Greenfield responded that Russias claims are \"absurd for many reasons, including because such species, even if they could be weaponised, would pose as much a threat to the European continent and Ukraine itself as they would to any other country.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRussias initial allegation of secret American biological warfare labs in Ukraine in March has been disputed by independent scientists, Ukrainian leaders, and officials at the White House and Pentagon.\n\nUkraine does have a network of biological labs that have received funding and research support from the US. They are owned and operated by Ukraine and are part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Programme that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manmade.\n\nThe US efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Unions program for weapons of mass destruction.\n\nHowever, the Kremlin's unfounded claims of biological weapons being developed in Ukraine -- used as one of the pretexts for the invasion -- have taken root online with various conspiracy theory groups, including QAnon.\n\nCargo ships anchored in the Marmara Sea await to cross the Bosphorus Straits in Istanbul.

Several grain ships leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports\n\nKyiv has confirmed that seven ships carrying grain and agricultural products left Black Sea ports on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vessels were loaded with 290,000 tonnes of food products and were headed towards European and Asian countries, the infrastructure ministry said.\n\nIt comes after Russia resumed its participation in a Turkish and UN-brokered deal aimed at delivering Ukrainian produce to global markets.\n\nMoscow has urged the United Nations to help fulfil the parts of the deal and \"remove obstacles\" to ease Russia's food and fertiliser exports.\n\n\"We have once again called on the United Nations Secretary-General to ensure that he fulfils the obligations he agreed to through his own initiative,\" foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday.\n\nMoscow suspended its participation in the grain deal on Saturday after a drone attack on its fleet based in the Sevastopol harbour in annexed Crimea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Russia performed a U-turn on the deal after saying it had received \"written guarantees\" from Kyiv that the safe humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea would be demilitarised.\n\nKyiv has stated that it has not offered \"any new commitments\" to Russia beyond the agreed deal.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the abrupt move showed \"both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united.\"\n\nAround 9.7 million tonnes of agricultural products have already been exported from Ukraine under the July deal.\n\nRussia has not yet decided whether or not to endorse an extension of the Ukrainian grain deal that expires in just over two weeks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Before deciding to continue, it will be necessary to make an assessment,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned.\n\n6. War has displaced more than 14 million Ukrainians, says UN\n\nRussias invasion of Ukraine has driven around 14 million Ukrainians from their homes, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said on Wednesday.\n\nFilippo Grandi told the UN Security Council that the displacement of civilians was the \"fastest, largest [...] witnessed in decades\".\n\nHumanitarian organisations have \"dramatically scaled up their response,\" he said, \"but much more must be done, starting with an end to this senseless war.\"\n\nUkrainians are about to face \"one of the worlds harshest winters in extremely difficult circumstances,\" including the continuing destruction of civilian infrastructure that is \"quickly making the humanitarian response look like a drop in the ocean of needs.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe displacement of Ukrainians means the number of refugees and displaced people worldwide has increased to more than 103 million, Grandi added.\n\nOn the ground, clashes continued on Wednesday with four civilian deaths reported in the eastern Donetsk region and another in Kharkiv.\n\nThe head of Zaporizhzhia wrote on Telegram that the Russian army was also attacking the area around the town and Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia facility was once again disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said.\n\nRussia carried out a new wave of massive strikes on critical Ukrainian infrastructure on Monday, causing water and electricity supplies to be cut off in the capital, Kyiv.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZelenskyy said the Russian strikes had damaged 40% of Ukraine's energy facilities, forcing the country to halt exports to the EU, where electricity prices are soaring.\n\n7. Russia and Ukraine free 214 in prisoner exchange\n\nRussia and Ukraine on Thursday exchanged 214 captured service personnel in the latest of a series of prisoner swaps, many of the Ukrainians wounded survivors of a failed attempt to defend the city of Mariupol in April and May.\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry said in a statement that Ukraine had released 107 Russian personnel, and that they would be transferred to Moscow for \"the necessary medical and psychological assistance\".\n\nAndriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said Russia had released 107 Ukrainian fighters, including 74 who had defended the Azovstal steel works, scene of Ukraine's last stand in Mariupol.\n\n\"We managed to exchange seriously injured and bedridden (fighters) from Mariupol, from 'Azovstal', boys with shrapnel wounds to arms and legs, gunshot wounds to various parts of the body. There are people with amputated limbs and (those) who can't feel part of their face, (others) with infected wounds.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n8. Antisemitism amplified by Russia's invasion of Ukraine EU report\n\nA European Union report has found that anti-semitism and disinformation had \"flourished\" online since the start of Russia's invasion in February.\n\nThe war has exacerbated online hate speech towards Jews that existed after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA).\n\nThe report found that the risk of misinformation and anti-semitism was fuelled by Moscow's \"misuse\" of the term Nazi.\n\n\"Jewish communities across Europe are deeply affected\" by online hate, it added.\n\nFRA director Michael O'Flaherty said on Thursday that anti-Semitism \"remains a serious problem\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Vienna-based organisation also stated that European countries are \"poor\" at recording antisemitic incidents, as some nations do not collect statistics.",

But after Russian soldiers swept into Kherson in early March, the anonymous building quickly became infamous.\n\nBlack sedans with tinted windows and missing license plates arrived at all hours, disgorging Ukrainian detainees with bags over their heads. Screams began to escape the three-story structure, piercing the once-calm neighborhood, residents said.\n\nSometimes, the gates would open, and a detainee would be dumped on the street, physically and mentally broken. Other captives were sent to a larger prison, or never seen again. \"If there is a hell on Earth, it was here,\" said Serhiy, 48, who lives across the street and whom The Washington Post is only identifying by first name to protect him from retribution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDays after Russian forces fled in retreat, surrendering the only regional capital Russia had managed to seize since the start of its invasion, the horrors that occurred in this stately 18th-century port city are just starting to come into focus.\n\nDuring a visit to the city on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said occupying Russian forces had committed \"hundreds\" of atrocities in the Kherson area, though he said the precise number was not yet known.\n\nWhat is already apparent, however, is that the Russians here operated a detention system on a scale not seen in any of the dozens of other cities, towns and villages liberated by Ukrainian forces in recent weeks.\n\nAn outline of mass incarceration was already appearing on Saturday and Sunday, when a dozen people told The Post that they had either been detained themselves or were searching for someone who had been taken. Many approached reporters on the street, asking for help in finding their loved ones.\n\nSome Kherson residents were arrested because they were accused of being freedom fighters. Others said locals were locked up because they had Ukrainian tattoos, wore traditional clothing, took selfies standing near Russian troops, or simply dared to say, \"Slava Ukraini\" \"Glory to Ukraine.\"\n\nA mother was arrested in front of her teenage son and held for two months on a suspicion of helping Ukrainian forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 64-year-old man was detained and beaten with a hammer for fighting eight years ago.\n\nA priest was arrested and sent to Crimea, according to a congregant. Even the mayor was arrested. Still, no one knows where he is.\n\n\"Were talking about thousands of people,\" said Oleksandr Samoylenko, head of the regional council of Kherson. \"On any given day, the Russians had 600 people in their torture chambers.\"\n\nSamoylenko said it would take time to figure out how many people were detained, how many remain missing, and if mass graves, like those found in other liberated areas, would also be discovered here.\n\n\"A lot of people have disappeared,\" Samoylenko said, adding that he feared the citys name would soon join the ranks of cities such as Bucha, Irpin and Izyum, which are now synonymous with Russian atrocities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was a nightmare,\" he said.\n\nEveryone could hear the torture\n\nWhat could set Kherson apart is the emerging scale of abuses.\n\nLocated where the Dnieper River meets the Black Sea, Kherson, with a prewar population of nearly 300,000, is by far the biggest city to be liberated. It was also the first to be occupied. Of cities that fell under Russian occupation, only Mariupol, which suffered severe destruction and remains under Russian control, is bigger.\n\nAnd as a regional capital crucial to Russian President Vladimir Putins plan to annex the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Kherson city is a window into the Russian military-administrative machine.\n\nMoscow-backed officials took over the regional administrative building downtown and began pumping out social media messages urging residents to obtain Russian passports to continue receiving their pensions and other benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome residents said officials offered cash payments in Russian rubles to get people to take a Russian passport. Schools were ordered to implement Russian curriculums, and Ukrainian nationalist songs were banned.\n\n\"Russia is here forever,\" billboards vowed.\n\nAs the Russian forces fled last week, however, that administrative state collapsed. Moscow-backed officials moved their headquarters to the small town of Henichesk, a port city on the Sea of Azov, closer to illegally annexed Crimea.\n\nThe deputy head of the Kherson occupation administration, Kirill Stremousov, who had criticized Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and other Russian military commanders over battlefield setbacks, died in a car accident last week on the same day that Shoigu approved the retreat from the city.\n\nEven the pro-Russian billboards are now being torn down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat remains, however, is the architecture of mass incarceration, and many missing people.\n\nMost people who spoke to The Post said they or their loved ones were first taken to the drab concrete building in the north of the city.\n\nSerhiy said he often saw Russians drag Ukrainian prisoners out of black sedans with bags on their heads and take them inside.\n\n\"Everyone could hear the torture, the screams, the shouts,\" he said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe building, a former youth detention center, was easy to adapt into a torture chamber. Most people who spent time in or around the place believed it was run by officers of the FSB, Russias feared Federal Security Service.\n\n\"The rooms were ready for them,\" said a nearby neighbor, Ihor Nikitenko, 57.\n\n\"They brought everyone they could get their hands on: partisans, activists, you name it,\" his wife, Larysa Nikitenko, 54, said as the couple shopped at a store next to the detention center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost as often as prisoners arrived, others were thrown onto the street, confused, half-naked and often seriously injured, they said.\n\nOleksandr Kuzmin said he was held in the detention center for a day, during which people he suspected to be FSB agents smashed his leg with a hammer all because he had fought against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas nearly a decade ago. In occupied towns, Russian forces routinely searched for men with prior military experience, often demanding that other residents identify them.\n\nKuzmin said that in a room below his cell, he could hear people screaming in pain, and he said a young man brought into his cell told him that he had been arrested for helping others access hryvnia, the Ukrainian currency, which Russia was trying to replace with the ruble.\n\nThe Russians had shocked the young man with electricity on his nipples and penis, Kuzmin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrisoners were forced to say, \"Hail Putin\" or \"Hail Russia\" to receive meals, according to neighbors who had spoken to detainees after their release. Those who refused received electric shocks.\n\nWe wanted to kill them so badly\n\nWhile residents of the neighborhood could hear the torture inside, they said they could also see the Russians enjoying themselves. Russian men came into shops on the street to buy food and copious amounts of alcohol. They also brought in women who appeared to be prostitutes, several locals said.\n\n\"We wanted to kill them so badly but we had to smile to their faces because we knew that one wrong word could land us in there,\" Serhiy said.\n\nIn a house just a few blocks away, Yuriy, 68, described how his son ended up in the detention center and is still being held captive in Crimea. The son, Roman, 38, had been part of a local territorial defense unit. When the Russians occupied Kherson in early March, his unit stayed and became resistance fighters, or partisans, smuggling weapons between safe houses and sometimes carrying out missions.\n\nThe Post is only identifying Yuriy and Roman by first name to avoid putting them at risk, or jeopardizing the sons safe return.\n\nFor weeks, the Russians were looking for Roman. They finally caught him on Aug. 4 and took him to the detention center, where he was beaten for several days. After two or three weeks, Roman was transferred to a prison downtown a fate that befell many of those accused of more-serious offenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the prison downtown, inmates let Roman use a smuggled telephone to call his dad. For the next two months, Yuriy was able to leave painkillers, medicine, cigarettes and candy for his son at the larger detention center, though he was never allowed to see him.\n\nHe dealt with Ukrainian prison officials, he said, and filled out Ukrainian documents from the 1980s that were written in Russian. When he last spoke to his son on Oct. 20, there was no hint that anything was about to change. But a day or two later, Yuriy heard that many of the prisoners had been taken to Crimea.\n\nAfter almost a month of searching, Yuriy said he finally learned Roman was alive and being held in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. Yuriy said he has no idea what will happen to his son, who, as a resistance fighter, is facing serious charges. Even if his son is released, Yuriy said has no idea how Roman will return home.\n\n\"He has no documents, no passport, no nothing,\" he said.\n\nOthers also told The Post they suspected friends or family members had been sent to Crimea as the Ukrainian armed forces advanced on Kherson city.\n\nSome believed their loved ones might be much closer: just across the Dnieper River in the Russian-held town of Chaplynka. But others said they had no idea where to start looking.\n\nOleksandr Zubrytskiy approached reporters on the street outside the detention center to ask for help finding his best friend, Petro Pikovskiy. Pikovskiy, 62, had gone out looking for his son who had been arrested by the Russians, only to vanish himself, Zubrytskiy said.\n\nWork for us or leave\n\nSerhiy Didenko, 42, was walking to join the celebration in Khersons main square on Sunday morning when he saw smoke rising from the large prison complex downtown where he used to work.\n\nDidenko stepped over broken glass and followed inside after a team of soldiers who were clearing the building of mines and booby traps. Potatoes, presumably spilled by fleeing Russians a few days earlier, were strewn along the path into the building. Elsewhere inside, riot gear was scattered on the floor as if tossed aside in a hurry.\n\n\"I cant express how I feel right now,\" Didenko said, examining his office, from which the Russians had stolen a television, microwave, even an old sofa. Eventually, he summoned the words: \"pure anger.\"\n\nThe Russians had arrived at the building on May 12, he said, and delivered an ultimatum: \"Work for us or leave.\" He chose the latter, and this was his first time back in the building.\n\nThe 700-person detention center had been half-full when he left, Didenko said. But it quickly filled with suspected partisans, activists or anyone bold enough to raise their voice to a Russian.\n\nThe new jailers put some of the prisoners to work building wooden structures for military trenches, according to two men who had been locked up since before the war began. Maksym Karynoi and Serhiy Tereshchenko, both 41, said they believed they were targeted because of their past military service fighting Russian separatists.\n\nThe Russians also introduced themselves to the inmates with terror, throwing hand grenades and randomly shooting inside the massive Soviet-built complex, according to three other inmates who were also already serving sentences when the prison was taken over.\n\n\"One person refused to get on his knees, so they shot him,\" said Andriy, a rail-thin 35-year-old prisoner who asked that his last name not be used. \"They left his dead body in the cell for 24 hours.\"\n\nAndriy and two other inmates told The Post that they believed the Russians had executed some of the suspected partisans.\n\n\"There would be one person on either side,\" said another inmate, Vardan Maglochyan, 61. \"They would drag them outside. Then wed hear gunshots.\"\n\nThey never saw those inmates again, they said.\n\nThe Post was unable to inspect the building where the inmates believed the men were killed because it was on fire and the roof was collapsing on Sunday. The fire could have been caused by Ukrainian demining teams detonating explosives the occupiers left behind. But the inmates had another explanation. They said they believed the Russians were destroying evidence.\n\nNeighbors suspected something similar across town, at the detention center, where smoke began to pour from the upper floors on Friday night, just a few hours after the last Russians had left Kherson.",

                "cc_text": "KHERSON, Ukraine (AP) President Volodymyr Zelenskyy triumphantly walked the streets of the newly liberated city of Kherson on Monday, hailing Russias withdrawal as the \"beginning of the end of the war,\" but also acknowledging the heavy price Ukrainian troops are paying in their grinding effort to push back the invaders.\n\nThe retaking of Kherson was one of Ukraines biggest successes in the nearly 9-month-old war, dealing another stinging blow to the Kremlin. It could serve as a springboard for more advances into occupied territory.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called it a \"significant victory\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"I can do nothing but applaud the courage, determination and capacity of the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian military,\" he said on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Indonesia. \"Theyve really been amazing. ... were going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves.\"\n\nLarge parts of eastern and southern Ukraine are still under Russian control, and the city of Kherson itself remains within reach of Moscows shells and missiles. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere in Ukraine. Russias state news agency RIA Novosti reported the town of Oleshky, in Russian-held territory across the Dnieper River from Kherson, came under heavy artillery fire.\n\nZelenskyy awarded medals to soldiers in Kherson and posed with them for selfies while striking a defiant note.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the end of the war,\" he said. \"We are step by step coming to all the temporarily occupied territories.\"\n\nBut he also grimly noted the fighting \"took the best heroes of our country.\"\n\nThe end of Russias occupation of the city the only provincial capital seized since the February invasion has sparked days of celebration. But as winter approaches, its remaining 80,000 residents are without heat, water and electricity, and short on food and medicine. Zelenskyy says the city is laced with booby traps and mines. And Ukrainian authorities say there are signs of atrocities emerging, just as in other liberated areas.\n\nRussian forces \"destroyed everything in their path, wrecked the entire electricity network,\" he said. Communications operators said cellphone service was being restored and the regional governor said a public wireless internet access point would begin working Tuesday.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has won \"an important victory\" in Kherson and other areas west of the Dnieper, but the Washington-based think tank noted that \"it has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Moscow should not be underestimated.\n\n\"The Russian armed forces retain significant capability as well as a large number of troops, and Russia has demonstrated their willingness to bear significant losses,\" he said in The Hague.\n\nIn Ankara, Turkey, CIA Director Bill Burns met with his Russian intelligence counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, to underscore the consequences if Moscow were to deploy a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, according to a White House National Security Council official.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Burns and Naryshkin, the head of Russias SVR spy agency, did not discuss settlement of the war. Their meeting was the highest-ranking face-to-face engagement between U.S. and Russian officials since before the invasion.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have warned for months of the prospect that Russia could use weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine amid battlefield setbacks, Biden administration officials have repeatedly said nothing has changed in U.S. intelligence assessments to suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin has imminent plans to deploy nuclear weapons.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly, meanwhile, passed a resolution calling for establishing a mechanism to assess Russian reparations for damages and injuries in Ukraine. The resolution is not binding and Russias ambassador said it had no legal validity.\n\nZelenskyys trip to Kherson was another in a series of unexpected visits to front-line areas at crucial moments of the war. It was laden with symbolism and the common touch aimed at boosting the morale of soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nIn a video, a visibly moved Zelenskyy stood with his hand on his heart and sang the national anthem as troops saluted and stood at attention and a soldier raised the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag.\n\nResidents draped with flags on their shoulders cheered, cried and shouted in gratitude as Zelenskyy walked by.\n\n\"Its amazing. Weve been waiting for him for nine months. Thank you,\" said Danila Yuhrenko.\n\nSerhii Yukhmchuk, 47, said he and his wife spent the occupation mostly at home to avoid any Russians and protested by refusing to use the ruble as currency.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on Zelenskyys visit, except to say: \"You know that it is the territory of the Russian Federation.\" Russia illegally annexed the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian provinces earlier this year, in addition to annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nIn his Sunday night address, Zelenskyy said that \"investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, and the bodies of both civilians and military personnel have been found.\"\n\n\"In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country,\" he said. \"We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt.\"\n\nResidents said Russian troops plundered the city and wrecked key infrastructure before retreating across the wide Dnieper River to its east bank last week.\n\nReconnecting the electricity supply is the priority, regional Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said.\n\nThe arrival of winter is making the situation more difficult, with Stoltenberg saying that Putin is aiming \"to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter.\"\n\nBiden said he expected things to slow down somewhat militarily \"because of the winter months and the inability to move as easily around.\"\n\nIn the past two months, Ukraines military claimed to have retaken dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson, a key gateway to Crimea to the south.\n\nBut the grinding war continued with shelling, civilian casualties and each side reporting gains.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its forces had captured the village of Pavlivka in the eastern Donetsk region. Multiple Ukrainian officials have reported heavy battles there in recent weeks.\n\nIn Luhansk, another eastern region illegally annexed by Moscow, Kyivs forces have retaken 12 settlements, said regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said missile and drone strikes have slowed down a bit in Ukraine since the end of October. The U.S. doesnt know the specific reason for the decline, the official said, but noted that Russia continues to see its weapons stockpiles decrease, particularly precision-guided munitions.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide the U.S. military assessment, said Russia continues to hit civilian infrastructure, including the electrical grid, and the U.S. has no reason to believe Moscow will let up on its attacks any time soon.\n\nAsked if the U.S. will scale back its weapons contributions to Kyiv as winter takes hold, and fighting is likely to level off a bit, the official said Washington will continue to work with allies to ensure it has what it needs and that air defense systems will be an ongoing priority.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers John Leicester in Kyiv, Hanna Arhirova in Odesa, Ukraine, and Aamer Madhani and Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

                "cc_text": "Talks are a distant prospect, experts warn, as the battlefield reality and winter will dictate both sides strategic calculus.\n\nThis past week, Ukrainian and Russian officials have made several public statements in an apparent willingness to re-engage in dialogue, blaming one another for stalling a possible negotiated solution after nearly nine months of fighting.\n\nBut experts have said the prospect of meaningful talks remains distant. Ukraine, they say, will seek to achieve more battlefield gains before heading to the negotiating table, while Russia hopes the impact of winter on Ukraines allies will fracture international support for Kyiv and weaken its resolve.\n\n\"It makes sense to wait for now Ukrainian forces now have momentum, they are advancing further in Kherson and that progress is going to set the stage and conditions for any discussion,\" said William Taylor, a US former ambassador to Ukraine and vice president at the US Institute of Peace.\n\nOn Friday, the Russian army officially completed its retreat from the strategic Kherson city in the south, withdrawing to the eastern side of the Dnieper River, a reversal of its biggest military achievement since the start of the war. The southern regional capital was the only one it seized throughout the conflict.\n\n\"The problem with the negotiations now is that Russia has shown no serious proposals,\" said Steven Pifer, senior fellow at the Brookings Institutions Center on the US and Europe. \"The demands of Russians have escalated, even if they have suffered bigger losses on the ground,\" said Pifer, who served as the US ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000.\n\nDespite losing territory, Russia yet insists Kherson is Russian land, following widely condemned and unrecognised annexations of four Ukrainian regions in September. \"There can be no negotiations until Russia becomes more realistic and takes into account the reality of the battlefield,\" he said.\n\nDesigned to maintain an alliance\n\nThe annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson marked a turning point in Zelenskyys position towards talks. Following Russias move, he signed a decree ruling out any chance of holding negotiations with Putin. \"We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president,\" he said on October 4.\n\nZelenskyy had made a clear departure from a softer position adopted in March, when he had demanded Russian troops to withdraw to the pre-February invasion borders. But after the annexation move, he stepped up the conditions, asking the Russians to pull out from the whole of the country Crimea and the eastern Donbas included.\n\nHis tone hardened as Ukrainian troops were enjoying more battlefield successes by the time of his decree. Moscows troops had failed to reach the capital Kyiv and Ukrainian forces were winning back swaths of territory in the northeast. Further eroding trust for talks, was the emergence of atrocities committed against Ukrainian civilians allegedly at the hands of Russian occupying forces.\n\nOn Monday though, Zelenskyy listed five conditions to sit at the table, including the restoration of Ukraines territorial integrity, the persecution of war crimes, and compensation for losses. These are not new requests from Zelenskyy, but this time, there was no mention of the earlier veto on talking with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. This somewhat softened stance came after a Washington Post report suggested US officials want Ukraine to signal an openness towards talks, but not necessarily start them.\n\nWestern leaders appear to be growing weary of increasing popular discontent. Soaring energy bills and spiralling inflation, which are to a degree consequences of the conflict, are creating unrest.\n\n\"It is important for the Americans that Ukraine has a reasonable position and the one that Zelenskyy outlined is designed to maintain that alliance,\" said Taylor. \"But American officials are not pressuring or suggesting the Ukrainians should move towards negotiations,\" he added.\n\nCrimea, a red line?\n\nLooking ahead, the fate of the Kherson region could determine how quickly negotiations materialise, said Anatol Lieven, director of the Eurasia Programme at the Quincy Institute.\n\nUkraines southern region connects the mainland to Russian-annexed Crimea. The small isthmus linking the peninsula to Ukraine has turned into a key land corridor used to supply Russian troops.\n\n\"If Ukraine breaks through and captures not just the city, but the province of Kherson east of the Dnieper River, the hidden message of the [US President Joe] Biden administration is that they should stop and accept a ceasefire,\" Lieven said.\n\nThis is because to move beyond Kherson, Lieven said, would be regarded as a threat to Crimea, with major consequences.\n\n\"There are strong indications that if Ukraine tries to take Crimea, then Russias use of nuclear weapons is very high through a ladder of escalations,\" he said.\n\nPifer disagreed, arguing that the US would support Ukraine trying to drive out an invading force.\n\nHowever, Pifer noted, the Ukrainian army would rather aim at other targets than Crimea, which is militarily difficult to capture, but easy to defend, considering how narrow the stretch of land connecting the peninsula to the mainland is about five to seven kilometres (three to four miles) wide.\n\n\"I also dont think the US is saying dont do things due to nuclear concerns. The threat of nuclear weapons is serious, Putin does not back down, but also Putin does want a nuclear war,\" Pifer added.\n\nA tale of two strategies\n\nIts too soon to speak about negotiations as both sides have too much to gain or to lose, said security expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations Rafael Loss.\n\nAfter Russias retreat this week from Kherson city, Ukrainians are planning how to continue their goal of booting Moscows forces from the entire nation. \"It is not unreasonable that other fronts collapse, like Kharkiv and Kherson did,\" Loss added, pointing at possible offensives that would put pressure on Crimea and make progress in the northeast of the Donbas.\n\nKyiv will also need to consider its domestic context. After months of war and suffering, more than 85 percent of Ukrainians insist their nation should keep fighting rather than negotiating, a recent survey indicated.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Russia is banking more on a political, rather than military strategy,\" and is likely to seize on the winter season to foment unrest in Europe and undermine Western support which has been fundamental to Kyivs counteroffensive, Loss said.\n\nAs temperatures fall, Russia has hoped more people will flee Ukraine to neighbouring countries, putting pressure on Europe. In addition, the economic and energy crisis could worsen should Moscow further weaponise gas flow to Europe or threaten to sabotage underwater cables and pipeline connections, Loss said.\n\n\"Once winter is gone then there will be a re-assessment of the situation.\"",

(Ed Ram/Getty Images)\n\nAbout 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers are dealing with power outages Thursday evening, according to President Volodymr Zelensky.\n\nHouseholds across the country have been temporarily disconnected from energy supply under an emergency schedule aimed at stabilizing the nation's fragile electric grid. Russia has been bombing and destroying civilian infrastructure, ushering in fears of a cold, dark winter.\n\nMost people are affected in the capital, Kyiv, and nine other regions: Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kirovohrad, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, Cherkasy. Power outages are also possible in other areas.\n\n\"The very fact that Russia has resorted to terror against the energy sector indicates the weakness of the enemy.

The Kyiv government and Western military analysts remained cautious, suggesting Russia could be setting a trap for advancing Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left (eastern) bank,\" Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, said in an interview on Thursday (3 November) with Solovyov Live, a pro-Kremlin online media outlet.\n\nThe area includes Kherson city, capital of the region of the same name, and the only major city Russia has captured intact since its invasion in February. It also includes one side of a dam across the Dnipro which controls the water supply to irrigate Crimea, the peninsula Russia has occupied since 2014.\n\nPreviously, Russia had denied its forces were planning to withdraw from the area.\n\nEverything under control, we are leaving\n\nIn lengthy comments on Thursday night on a programme organised by RT television, Stremousov was somewhat more equivocal, saying \"we have to take some very difficult decisions now. Whatever our strategy might be. And some people might be afraid to recognise things.\n\n\"But for me it is very important to try to say at the moment People, please go over to the east bank. You will be in a far safer position,\" Stremousov said.\n\nIn his latest video, Russian-installed Kherson official Kirill Stremousov urges all civilians to \"evacuate\", but insists that \"at the moment everything is fully under control\" So why does he appear to be in his car with all his belongings in the back? https://t.co/i3ejZtUqRj pic.twitter.com/0XUvrUZghO Francis Scarr (@francis_scarr) November 3, 2022\n\nAt another point, Stremousov said he hoped \"that we will not leave Kherson\" and if that were to happen, \"it will be a big blow not only in terms of the image of us all, but a big blow for people who could stay here.\"\n\nSpeculation swirled over whether Russia was indeed pulling out, after photos circulated on the internet showing the main administrative building in Kherson city with Russias flag no longer flying atop it. Ukraine said those images could be Russian disinformation.\n\nRussian flag is removed from the main administrative building in Kherson pic.twitter.com/a5XG1FdEZe WarMonitor (@WarMonitor3) November 3, 2022\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraines southern military command, said it could be a Russian trap.\n\n\"This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles,\" she said in televised comments.\n\nMore attacks, power cuts\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Russian forces have launched three missile and 16 air strikes on Ukrainian targets as well as more than 40 shelling episodes, the Ukrainian military said in a statement on Thursday night.\n\nOn the southern front, Russian fire hit more than 35 towns and there were more than 30 reconnaissance missions by drones, the statement said.\n\nUkrainian aircraft made 12 strikes on eight Russian-occupied areas where men and equipment were concentrated, hitting four anti-aircraft units, the military said. Ukrainian artillery also struck three areas with men and equipment and two ammunition depots, it said.\n\nReuters was not able to verify battlefield reports.\n\nA Ukrainian foreign ministry statement accused the Russian authorities of carrying out \"mass forced movement of residents\" in Kherson and Zaporzhzhia provinces in the south and Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east \"to the territory of temporarily occupied Crimea or to the Russian Federation.\"\n\nUkraine has accused Russian forces of war crimes during the eight-month-long war, charges that Moscow rejects. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians, though the conflict has killed thousands, displaced millions and destroyed cities and towns.\n\nIts attacks in the past few weeks on Ukrainian energy and water supplies have hit civilians hard as winter approaches, the Kyiv government says. As of Thursday night, 4.5 million Ukrainians in the capital Kyiv and 10 other regions were temporarily without power, the latest outages caused by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address.\n\nTemperatures can fall far below freezing in winter, now just weeks away.\n\nCounter-offensive\n\nAnswering a question, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he believed Ukrainian forces could retake Kherson, in perhaps his most optimistic comments on the counter-offensive to date.\n\nA Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some Russian military commanders had rebased across the river to the east.\n\n\"We would assess that in Kherson, its likely that most echelons of command have withdrawn now across the river to the east, leaving pretty demoralized and often in some cases leaderless troops to face off Ukrainians on the other side,\" the official said.\n\nRussia has fought for months to hang on to the pocket of land it holds on the west bank at the mouth of the Dnipro River that bisects Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has attacked the main river crossings for months, making it difficult for Russia to supply its force on the west bank. Ukrainian troops have been advancing along the river since the start of October, although their advance had slowed in recent days.\n\nUkrainian troops on the front line last week, visited by Reuters, said they saw no evidence Russian forces were withdrawing and believed they were in fact reinforcing.\n\nMichael Kofman, a US expert on the Russian military who has just returned from the Ukrainian side of the Kherson front, said Moscows intentions were unclear.\n\n\"The situation in Kherson is clear as mud,\" tweeted Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses.\n\n(Edited by Georgi Gotev)\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

                "cc_text": "The Russia-Ukraine conflict: what is next? Russias ongoing war against Ukraine has now reached an important point. While Kyiv continues to make steady progress on the battlefield, Moscow is attempting to shore up its defences for over the winter. The coming months will likely prove crucial to the outcome of the conflict.\n\nOn February 24th, Russia sent approximately 150,000 troops into Ukraine, thereby escalating the eight-year-long conflict. So far, the Russian aggression in Ukraine has resulted in seven million Ukrainian refugees, and six million internally displaced people. The number of those displaced equals the entire population of a country like Rwanda. Heinous crimes committed by Russia continue unabated, including the mass deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and occupied territories. And as we speak, Kyiv is under constant bombardment, marking a new phase in the Russo-Ukrainian War. It has been eight months since the February escalation. What are the main trends? More importantly, what can we anticipate in the months ahead?\n\nOver the last few months, the Kremlin has done a fair amount of nuclear sabre-rattling. Yet, some experts are arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not have a serious nuclear option in Ukraine, even with regards to tactical nuclear weapons. For context, the two nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War had an explosive yield that equalled 15 and 20 kilotons of dynamite respectively. Most of Russias tactical nuclear weapons have yields the equivalent of at least 100 kilotons of dynamite. There are multiple reasons for refraining from using tactical nuclear weapons, but the political backlash combined with the large-scale damage, as well as the possible NATO response, should suffice.\n\nFurthermore, negotiations for a sustainable peace seem highly unlikely under current conditions. In September, Putin boxed himself in by signing \"accession treaties\" to formalise the illegal occupation of four Ukrainian territories Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. It is difficult for public officials, especially dictators, to walk back from such bold proclamations. Moreover, Ukrainians, including ethnic Russians and Russian speakers, encouraged by recent wins on the battleground, are resolute on reclaiming all the occupied territories. A recent poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 85 per cent of ethnic Russian-speaking Ukrainians oppose any form of territorial concessions to Moscow. This pours cold water on Putins claim that the \"Special Military Operation\" was set in motion to \"liberate\" Ukrainians, especially with regards to ethnic Russians and Russian speakers.\n\nThat said, in the absence of negotiations, arbitration, nuclear options, or even a coup in the Kremlin, for the time being, war will remain the main conflict resolution tool available to Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussia weak, Ukraine resilient\n\nIn late February, Russian officials still assumed that Ukraine would fall in a matter of a couple of weeks. Until then, many analysts believed that Russia possessed the second strongest military force in the world, while Ukraines military was perceived as weak and disorganised. But the February escalation has exposed Russias decaying system while shedding light on Ukraines growing resilience.\n\nFollowing Ukraines counteroffensive, which started in September, Russia now holds 19 per cent of Ukrainian territory, down from 27 per cent at its peak. The key reasons for the current facts on the battlefield relate to three aspects: Russian failures, Ukrainian resilience and adaptability, and western responses to the conflict.\n\nPutin made a number of fundamental mistakes following the February escalation. In the immediate period following the escalation, Russian troops were scattered across four axes around Ukraine, which meant that they were stretched thin. This weakness allowed Ukraine to cut Russian troops off from key supply lines.\n\nFurthermore, as argued by Michael Kofman, Director of Russia Studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, any external invasion and occupation attempt requires substantial \"manpower\" (a masculine word but appropriate in the context of Putins displays of masculinity). This is especially true for Ukraine, a country that is nearly 40 per cent larger than Iraq. \"The choice to not have much infantry in the force and build a military around a short-term war with NATO put the Russian forces in the worst possible position,\" states Kofman. Only a fraction of the initial invasion force was the regular military. As the war has dragged on, it has become clear that the Russian military has a shortage of manpower, particularly a shortage of infantry, and is increasingly dependent on non-regular troops.\n\nAs such, over the course of a few months, the image of a cohesive Russian military increasingly gave way to a force made up of mobilised personnel from occupied regions of Ukraine and volunteers from across Russian regions used to fill in as volunteer battalion replacements. By September, Russias manpower problem was on full display when footage of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the supposed head of the notorious Wagner Group, emerged of him helicoptering into Russian prisons to recruit soldiers to do Putins bidding. That same month, Putin announced the \"partial mobilisation\" of Russian reservists in the hopes of filling the manpower gap.\n\nOver the past eight months, Ukraine has proven its resilience and adaptability. It has been able to rapidly absorb western weapons and incorporate them into its ranks to defend Ukrainian land from Russian aggression. According to Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies, Kings College London, it was the fact that the Ukrainian forces showed resilience and their ability to fight and push the Russians back from Kyiv that encouraged NATO member states to provide unprecedented support to Ukraine early on. \"What has been impressive in the later stages of the war\", argues Freedman, \"is the seeming ease with which the Ukrainians have been using and integrating the different types of systems\". Ukraines clear motivation, knowledge of the terrain, early mobilisation, and strategic use of artillery to target ammunition dumps and command-and-control posts have been vital for their success.\n\nThat being said, one cannot underestimate how much western support for Ukraine has fundamentally changed the dynamics on the battleground. Support came in two forms: sanctions and weapons supplies.\n\nFirstly, sanctions against Russia helped to weaken the economy significantly. Initially, a rise in energy prices helped Russia to weather tough sanctions, especially as China and India were able to import energy from Russia to make up for income losses. Still, those imports were simply not enough to compensate for what the Russian economy lost from western cuts. The International Monetary Fund estimated that the Russian economy could shrink by as much as six per cent by the end of the year.\n\nOver the long-run, economic sanctions will not only put pressure on Putin at home to withdraw from Ukraine, but they will also make the sustainability of the war more challenging, thereby forcing him to reconsider his actions. In July, Russia adopted an amendment law that effectively transformed the Russian economy into a war economy. Moreover, sanctions are making it harder for Russia to import certain technological components necessary to replace some of the equipment that has been lost and damaged in Ukraine.\n\nSecondly, the most immediate impact of western support for Ukraine came in the form of weapons supplies. By mid-October, western governments and international financial institutions have pledged close to 100 billion US dollars to Ukraine, and a large slice of that support came in the form of military aid. Javelins and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) played a crucial role in helping the Ukrainians defend themselves in the first few months following the February escalation. Those weapons were effective, especially given their user-friendliness. Later on, the introduction of high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) became instrumental in helping Ukraine reclaim territories that were occupied by Russia.\n\nLooking into the crystal ball\n\nAccording to Mariia Avdeeva, Research Director at the European Expert Association, the series of Russian attacks on Kyiv starting on October 10th marks a \"new phase\" of the war. She argues that the new strategy lies in \"constant and deliberate\" strikes at critical Ukrainian infrastructure. Russian missiles and kamikaze drones are targeting electricity stations and water supplies, with Ukrainian authorities reporting that one-third of all Ukrainian infrastructure has been damaged. The highly imprecise nature of the Russian missiles means that residential areas around the key infrastructure are affected. Avdeeva argues that the renewed attacks against Kyiv aim to influence Ukrainian morale. Without heat, electricity and water, large Ukrainian cities will struggle to survive the upcoming winter.\n\nGoing forward, the key determinants will continue to involve the strength of the Russian military versus that of Ukraine. At the same time, it will be important to monitor the unified approach employed by NATO and other allies to (1) maintain sanctions against Russia, and (2) supply Ukraine with weapons needed to reclaim territories occupied by Russia and defend itself from ongoing bombardment.\n\nThe type of weapons needed is particularly important. Avdeeva states that in order to win the war, Ukraine needs to regain all occupied territories. This cannot happen without the supply of Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which uses longer-range missiles. HIMARS have played a pivotal role in Ukraines counteroffensive so far, but long-range missiles are needed to break Russian supply routes in the occupied territories. Avdeeva also stressed that these types of weapons are critical for protecting civilians. Past scenes from Kharkiv and now in Zaporizhzhia show that the closer Russian troops are to the civilian population, the more intensively they attack these territories. The ATACMS, which can be launched by HIMARS, would be crucial for pushing the Russian military out of the occupied territories, protecting critical infrastructure, and saving innocent lives.\n\nSo far, NATO has been unwilling to supply Ukraine with ATACMS for fear that, in US President Bidens words, it would lead to \"World War III\". However, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe, thinks that the US is overestimating Russias willingness to widen the conflict.\n\nThree scenarios\n\nWar is full of pitfalls, and one must be wary of predictions based on how the war has gone so far. That being said, according to Michael Kofman, there are a host of scenarios that could play out in the coming months.\n\nThe first likely scenario is that Ukraine continues to make gains. Kofman stipulates that in the short term, the war could enter an \"attritional phase during early winter (), with less offensive manoeuvre operations\", and resume ground offensives in the later winter months. In the long term, Ukraine will retain the advantage if external support is sustained. This is not a given, however. Kofman argues that the rate of US weapons supplies in recent months, which proved critical in the successful counteroffensive period, may not be sustainable given the defensive-industrial capacity.\n\nThe second scenario is that Russias mobilisation efforts could succeed, they stabilise the lines and improve the situation coming out of winter. According to Kofman however, the mobilisation is unlikely to yield much strategic change for the Russian military for \"at least another three to four months\". Moreover, even if mobilisation improves Russian force availability, this may only mean an extension to the length of the war. It does not necessarily mean it changes Russian chances in the conflict, which is a matter of economic sustainability and military motivation.\n\nThe final scenario that may play out in the coming months is an internal conflict within the Russian military and regime. Kofman pointed out that the mobilisation is occurring ahead of the winter months to \"stabilise lines and ostensibly hold trenches\". If the deployment occurs without the right amount of equipment and level of support, demoralisation is likely. Although it is difficult to know what is happening inside the Kremlin, there are reports that Putin is being criticised by his former allies, the ultra-nationalists and hardliners. Lawrence Freedman similarly underscores that there is anecdotal evidence circulating online about \"units being almost at the point of mutiny\". Freedman highlights that if logistics fail and decent supplies do not get to the new recruits, Russian troops will not be able to survive the winter.\n\nKey for the future months will be how well the Russian state copes with the challenge of sustaining frontline forces in a country where it is not popular and not welcome.\n\nDr. Leon Hartwell is the Senior Advisor for the Central and South-East Europe Programme (CSEEP) at LSE IDEAS and a Non-Resident Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) in Washington D.C. @LeonHartwell on Twitter.\n\nJulia Ryng is Project and Research Associate at LSE IDEAS and a PhD candidate in the Arts and Humanities Faculty at University College London. @juliaryng on Twitter.",

All times EDT.\n\n10 p.m.: Russia has probably committed crimes against humanity by forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians in Russian-occupied areas of the country to other regions, Amnesty International said Thursday, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nIt said civilians were moved from occupied Ukraine further into Russian-controlled areas or into Russia, with children separated from their families in violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nAmnesty said it had been told by civilians they had endured \"abusive screening processes,\" known as filtration, which sometimes resulted in arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment.\n\n\"Separating children from their families and forcing people hundreds of kilometers from their homes are further proof of the severe suffering Russia's invasion has inflicted on Ukraine's civilians,\" said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International's secretary general.\n\nThe rights group said it interviewed 88 people, the majority civilians from Mariupol, the Ukrainian Black Sea city seized by Russia after a brutal siege, as well as residents from the Kharkiv, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\n\"Most, especially those from Mariupol, described coercive conditions that meant that they had no meaningful choice but to go to Russia or other Russian-occupied areas,\" it said.\n\nAmnesty said that once in Russia, several people said they felt pressured into applying for Russian citizenship, or said their movements were restricted.\n\n9:01 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden voiced hope Wednesday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would negotiate \"more seriously\" to free basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sent to a penal colony just ahead of U.S. congressional elections, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nBiden appeared to link the case of Griner, whose plight has generated widespread anger in the United States, to Tuesday's midterm vote in which the president's Democratic Party exceeded expectations against the rival Republicans.\n\n\"My hope is that now that the election is over that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about prisoner exchange,\" Biden told a post-election news conference.\n\n\"That is my intention -- my intention is to get her home, and we've had a number of discussions so far,\" Biden said.\n\nHe did not elaborate but tensions with Russia have soared over the invasion of Ukraine, to which the United States is sending billions of dollars in weapons.\n\n8:06 p.m.: Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the area is going well, even though there are \"difficulties.\" During an interview with The Associated Press, Haidai said that Russian troops had \"time to prepare\" and added that a \"huge amount of territory\" was mined.\n\nBut after the recent advancements by the military, the \"brilliant actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are absolutely obvious,\" he said.\n\nHe said the winter will not stop the push-back, adding that it is better \"to move forward,\" even slowly. \"We cannot stand still. No one will engage in positional wars,\" he said.\n\n7:14 p.m.: Berlin is turning a former airport into a temporary refugee shelter with 3,600 beds, as it struggles to put up more Ukrainians fleeing Russia's attacks on their country's vital infrastructure, as well as the winter weather, The Associated Press reported.\n\nWhile two former terminals of Tegel Airport were already opened for Ukrainian refugees in the spring, Berlin's state government is now racing to fix two big tents on the tarmac with heaters for the winter and has opened a third terminal for the registration of new arrivals and also put up 900 new beds.\n\nGermany has taken in 1 million refugees from Ukraine since Russia attacked the eastern European country almost nine months ago.\n\nIn addition, more asylum seekers than in previous years are coming to Germany from countries such as Syria, Moldova or Afghanistan.\n\n6:34 p.m.: The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said Wednesday that she does not expect the U.S. midterm election to weaken Washington's support for Ukraine given the bipartisan backing for Kyiv since Russia's invasion of its neighbor, The Associated Press reported.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield spoke after she visited a UNICEF center in Warsaw that has become a hub for Ukrainian refugee children and their mothers, offering educational support and therapy.\n\nShe said her talks with government and Warsaw city officials included making contingency plans in case the coming winter and power outages create another large exodus of Ukrainians to Poland and other frontline states.\n\n5:35 p.m.: Actor Sean Penn, who is making a documentary about Russias invasion of Ukraine, has loaned one of his two Oscars to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and told him: \"When you win, bring it back to Malibu,\" The Associated Press reported.\n\nZelenskyys office on Wednesday released the video of the encounter during Penns most recent visit to Ukraine, his third since the Feb. 24 start of the war.

General Assembly scheduled a vote for Monday on a resolution that would call for Russia to be held accountable for violating international law by invading Ukraine, including by paying reparations.\n\nThe draft resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would recognize the need to establish \"an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury\" arising from Russias \"wrongful acts\" against Ukraine.\n\nIt would recommend that the assemblys 193 member nations, in cooperation with Ukraine, create \"an international register\" to document claims and information on damage, loss or injury to Ukrainians and the government caused by Russia.\n\nRussias veto power in the 15-member Security Council has blocked the U.N.s most powerful body from taking any action since President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24. But there are no vetoes in the General Assembly, which already has adopted four resolutions criticizing Russias invasion.\n\n3:18 p.m.:\n\n2:30 p.m.: Cambodia's leader met Ukraine's foreign minister on Wednesday in Phnom Penh, with Prime Minister Hun Sen saying his country \"opposes aggression\" days ahead of a regional summit that Russia's foreign minister is due to attend, Reuters reported.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is due to sign a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a senior Cambodian official said, as Kyiv seeks to strengthen ties with the bloc, which joined international condemnation of Russia's invasion.\n\nIn a statement on his Facebook page, Hun Sen said Cambodia \"opposes aggression, threats or the use of violence against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent states.\"\n\n2:15 p.m.:\n\n2 p.m.: India will expand economic ties with Russia and continue to buy oil from Moscow, India's foreign minister said, pointing out that imports of discounted crude from Moscow have worked to its advantage, VOAs Anjana Pasricha reported.\n\nForeign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said during a visit to Moscow that as the world's third-largest consumer of oil, it is \"our fundamental obligation\" to ensure that Indian consumers have the \"best possible access on the most advantageous terms to international markets.\"\n\nHe made his comments after a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday.\n\nIn his first visit to Russia since the Ukrainian conflict erupted, the Indian minister reaffirmed New Delhi's longstanding ties with Moscow calling it an \"exceptionally steady\" and \"time-tested relationship.\"\n\n1:50 p.m.: Paratroopers with Ukraine's 79th Air Assault Brigade say they're holding positions around the small city of Maryinka in eastern Ukraine despite daily Russian attacks.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n1:40 p.m.: Russia's leading war hawks on Wednesday swiftly rallied behind the decision to abandon the Ukrainian city of Kherson, putting a brave face on one of Moscow's most humiliating retreats in nearly nine months of war, Reuters reported.\n\nThe pullout proposed by General Sergei Surovikin, appointed last month to take overall charge of Russia's war effort, means Moscow is giving up a strategic city just north of annexed Crimea, the only Ukrainian provincial capital it had captured since its February 24 invasion.\n\nThe decision - described by one Russian military blogger as \"a black page in the history of the Russian army\" - was nonetheless quickly defended by some of the most high-profile proponents of the war as a wise and necessary action.\n\n\"After weighing all the pros and cons, General Surovikin made the difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers,\" said Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader who has frequently urged a more aggressive approach to the war and has even called for the use of low-grade nuclear weapons.\n\n1:35 p.m.:\n\n1:20 p.m.: Russias military announced Wednesday that its withdrawing from Kherson, but Ukrainian authorities cautioned against considering the retreat a done deal. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that the Russians were feigning a pullout from Kherson to lure the Ukrainian army into an entrenched battle in the strategic industrial port city, The Associated Press reported.\n\nRecapturing Kherson could allow Ukraine to win back lost territory in the Zaporizhzhia region and other southern areas, leading to an eventual push back into Crimea, which Russia illegally seized in 2014. A Russian retreat is almost certain to raise domestic pressure on the Kremlin to escalate the conflict.\n\nBut Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter: \"Actions speak louder than words. We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight.\"\n\nYaroslav Yanushevych, Khersons Ukrainian-appointed governor, called on residents \"not to give in to euphoria\" just yet. Another Ukrainian-appointed Kherson regional official, Serhii Khlan, told reporters that Russian forces had blown up five bridges to slow the advance of Kyivs forces.\n\nAs the reports of a Russian withdrawal emerged, Zelenskyy met with his senior military staff in Kyiv to discuss the situation, including attempts to recapture territory, his website reported without giving details.\n\nIn addition to the largely successful counteroffensive, Ukrainian resistance fighters behind the front line have worked inside Kherson, with acts of sabotage and assassinations of Moscow-appointed officials.\n\n1:05 p.m.:\n\n12:50 p.m.: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday it was \"encouraging\" to see Ukrainian forces being able to liberate more of the country's territory, after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ordered his troops to withdraw from Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking in London where he was meeting British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Stoltenberg said: \"It is encouraging to see how the brave Ukrainian forces are able to liberate more Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"The victories, the gains the Ukrainian armed forces are making belong to the brave, courageous Ukrainian soldiers but of course the support they receive from the United Kingdom, from NATO allies and partners is also essential,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Sunak, a Downing Street spokesperson said the pair had emphasized the importance of continuing to support Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n12:35 p.m.:\n\n12:20 p.m.: Britain is stepping up its support for Ukrainian soldiers through the winter as a key battle in Kherson looms and as mobilized Russian troops struggle, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Reuters on Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\nWallace joined NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to observe the training of Ukrainian troops in the southeast English town of Lydd, as Britain announced the delivery of a further 12,000 extreme cold-weather sleeping kits for Ukraine.\n\n\"Winter is approaching and that is an important challenge for both sides,\" he said. \"So we're determined ... to give Ukrainian soldiers the best basic skills because we already know that the Russian military aren't doing that.\"\n\nUkrainian forces have piled pressure on Russian troops in the southern region of Kherson that Moscow occupied in February - the only place where Russia has a presence on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\n12:05 p.m.: The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in an interview with CNN that it will be critical to help Ukrainian civilians stay warm and safe as the winter looms.\n\n11:55 a.m.: The European Union's executive arm on Wednesday proposed a support package for war-gripped Ukraine worth up to 18 billion euros ($18.06 billion) in 2023, but Hungary said it would not contribute to the joint assistance, which would come as highly concessional loans, Reuters reported.\n\n\"This shows true solidarity of the EU,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted after the European Commission unveiled its plan. \"Together we resist Russia's aggression, together we'll rebuild Ukraine, together we'll be in the EU.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal faced resistance from Hungary, which has dragged its feet on EU sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, even before the Commission's announcement.\n\n\"I have made it clear that Hungary is ready to support Ukraine, but we do not wish to contribute to any new loan to be taken up by the EU,\" Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n11:45 a.m.:\n\n11:40 a.m.: A senior adviser to Ukraine's president said on Wednesday it was too early to talk about a Russian troop pullout from the southern city of Kherson, Reuters reported.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday ordered his troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in the face of Ukrainian attacks near the southern city of Kherson.\n\n\"It's necessary to separate words from deeds,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a statement to Reuters. \"Until the Ukrainian flag is flying over Kherson, it makes no sense to talk about a Russian withdrawal.\"\n\nHe said that Russian forces remained in Kherson, which was captured by Russian troops shortly after Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine but had become the focus of a Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n\"Ukraine does not take these statements (by Russia) into consideration,\" he said. \"It is still too early to talk about the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson: a grouping of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is being maintained in the city, and additional manpower is being pulled into the region.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our armed forces work according to their plan: reconnaissance, risk assessment, effective counterattack.\"\n\n11:25 a.m.: Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted a message Wednesday reacting to television reports that Russias military has ordered its troops to withdraw from the southern city of Kherson.\n\n10:55 a.m.: Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday ordered his troops to withdraw from the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson and take up defensive lines on the opposite bank of the River Dnipro, Reuters reported.\n\nThe announcement marked one of Russia's most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war, now nearing the end of its ninth month.\n\nIn televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, said it was no longer possible to keep Kherson city supplied.\n\n\"We will save the lives of our soldiers and fighting capacity of our units. Keeping them on the right (western) bank is futile. Some of them can be used on other fronts,\" Surovikin said.\n\nThe news followed weeks of Ukrainian advances towards the city and a race by Russia to relocate tens of thousands of its residents.\n\nShoigu responded: \"I agree with your conclusions and proposals. Proceed with the withdrawal of troops and take all measures to transfer forces across the river.\"\n\nThe announcement had been anticipated by Russia's influential war bloggers, who described it as a bitter blow.\n\n10:45 a.m.:\n\n10:20 a.m.: Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, died on Wednesday in a car crash, Russian state news agencies reported, according to Reuters.\n\nStremousov was one of the most prominent public faces of the Russian occupation of Ukraine, using social media to pump out aggressive statements, of which the latest appeared on Wednesday morning.\n\nTASS news agency said the press service for the head of the region had confirmed his death. The exact circumstances were unclear.\n\n9:50 a.m.: The U.S. midterm elections could have a significant impact on Ukraine, where U.S. support is invaluable in the war effort.

Our air defense destroyed five barrage ammunition. They also attacked the city of Dnipro with drones, targeting a logistics enterprise. Four employees were wounded; three of them are in serious condition in the hospital,\" Governor Valentyn Reznichenko said.\n\nRussian forces also bombarded the Nikopol district in the region with Grad missiles and heavy artillery. Reznichenko said the shelling damaged private houses, a factory, and a power line, but no one was injured.\n\nA fire spread over more than 3,000 square meters but was extinguished, Reznichenko said.\n\nRussian troops regularly shell the Dnipropetrovsk region with various types of weapons, in particular the Nikopol, Kryvorizky, and Synelnyk districts.\n\n9:15 a.m.:\n\n9:05 a.m.: Russia said on Wednesday it still saw no progress on easing its exports of fertilizers and grain - parts of the Black Sea grain deal that Moscow views as fundamental to extending the initiative beyond next week, Reuters reported.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters the United States and European Union were obstructing Russia's exports and said it remained unclear whether Moscow would extend its participation in the initiative, which expires on Nov. 19.\n\n\"The U.S. and the EU continue to put up obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain. We will take this into account when deciding whether to extend the grain deal,\" she said.\n\nRussia agreed to a deal brokered by the United Nations in Turkey in July that allowed Ukraine, a major grain exporter, to resume exports through Black Sea ports that Russian warships had blockaded.\n\n8:45 a.m.:\n\n8:05 a.m.: Switzerland will extend for a year its streamlined process for hosting refugees from the war in Ukraine, the government said on Wednesday, deciding it was not yet safe for people to return home, Reuters reported.\n\nThe cabinet said special protection status for these people would remain in effect until March 2024 barring a fundamental change in the situation in Ukraine. Switzerland's doors opened in March this year, shortly after Russia invaded its neighbor.\n\nSince March more than 67,000 Ukrainians have received refuge in Switzerland. As of Oct. 31, 6,394 people had permanently left Switzerland to return home, the cabinet added in a statement.\n\nEastern European countries are preparing for a possible new wave of Ukrainian refugees

parliament will discuss the ratification of Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO during its autumn session after a series of EU-related bills have been passed, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Finland and Sweden are our allies and they can count on us,\" Gergely Gulyas told a briefing.\n\nHungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not cleared the accession.\n\n\"Our aim is that parliament should ratify their application before the end of this year ... we have always said we supported the ratification,\" Gulyas said, in reply to a question.\n\nOrban's government had submitted the relevant bills in mid-July, but parliament, in which his ruling Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority, has still not tabled the two bills for debate and approval.\n\n6:20 a.m.:\n\n6 a.m.: Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned the use of mercenaries in Russia's war against Ukraine, saying they were inflicting \"so much cruelty\" on the

suffer so much cruelty, so much cruelty by the mercenaries who are making war.\"\n\nThe pope did not specifically mention Russia and he did not elaborate, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, has been accused by the European Union and the United States of mounting clandestine operations on the Kremlin's behalf in Ukraine, which Russian forces invaded in February.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said the group does not represent the state but that private military contractors have the right to work anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law.\n\n5:42 a.m.: The secretaries of Russia and Iran's Security Councils discussed the situation in Ukraine, security cooperation and measures to combat \"Western interference\" in their domestic affairs at a series of meetings in Tehran on Wednesday, Reuters reported citing Russian state media.\n\nNikolai Patrushev, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was in Tehran as Russia and Iran try to forge closer ties amid Western isolation.\n\n4:59 a.m.: Eastbound gas flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Germany to Poland rose on Wednesday as did Russian

possible wave of Ukrainian refugees as Russia targets power and heating plants ahead of winter, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy saying about 4 million people are already without power.\n\nZelenskiyy said 14 regions plus the capital Kyiv were without power and Ukraine's electrical grid operator Ukrenergo said scheduled hourly power outages would affect the whole of the country

She was sentenced on August 4 to nine years in a penal colony on charges of possessing and smuggling drugs.\n\nGriner had pleaded guilty but said she had made an \"honest mistake\" and had not meant to break the law.\n\nNeither Griner's exact whereabouts nor her final destination were known, the legal team said in a statement, adding that in line with Russian procedures, her attorneys as well as the U.S. Embassy should be notified upon her arrival at her destination.\n\nThe notification would take up to two weeks to be received.\n\nThe White House said U.S. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to \"prevail on her Russian captors to improve her treatment and the conditions she may be forced to endure in a penal colony.\"\n\nIt did not give any details about Griner's whereabouts.\n\n12:30 a.m.: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his forces would not yield \"a single centimeter\" in battles for the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk while Russian-installed officials said Ukrainian forces were moving into a southern town with tanks, Reuters reported.\n\nThe focal points of the conflict in the industrial region of Donetsk are around the towns of Bakhmut, Soledar and Avdiivka, which have seen the heaviest fighting since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in late February.\n\n\"The activity of the occupiers remains at an extremely high level dozens of attacks every day,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address late on Tuesday. \"They are suffering extraordinarily high losses. But the order remains the same to advance on the administrative boundary of Donetsk region. We will not yield a single centimeter of our land,\" he said.\n\nThe region is one of four Russia said it annexed in September.

                "cc_text": "Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered the countrys troops to retreat to the Dnipro rivers right bank, a move that will likely lead to Moscow surrendering the key southern city of Kherson. Ukrainian victory in Kherson, one of the main objectives of Kyivs southern offensive, will be widely seen as a significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the annexation of the Kherson region along with three other regions.\n\nIn televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, recommended the withdrawal of Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnieper River, citing logistical difficulties. \"Kherson cannot be fully supplied and function. Russia did everything possible to ensure the evacuation of the inhabitants of Kherson.\" Surovikin told Shoigu. \"The decision to defend on the left bank of the Dnieper is not easy, at the same time we will save the lives of our military,\" Surovikin added.\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces also clashed overnight over Snihurivka, a town about 30 miles north of Kherson.\n\nVillages and towns in Ukraine have experienced more heavy fighting and shelling as Ukrainian and Russian forces strained to advance on different fronts after more than eight and a half months of war. At least nine civilians were killed and 24 others were wounded in 24 hours, the Ukrainian Presidents office said, as it accused Russia of using explosive drones, rockets, heavy artillery and aircraft to attack eight regions in the countrys south-east.\n\nKirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the Kherson region, has died in a car crash, state news agencies have reported, citing local Russian-backed officials. Stremousov, previously an anti-vaccine blogger and political marginal, had emerged as one of the most prominent public faces of the Russian occupation of Ukraine, frequently using social media to record aggressive anti-Ukrainian videos. Stremousovs death comes as Ukraine appears to have launched a new offensive to recapture the key city of Kherson.\n\nRussia said it still saw no progress on easing its exports of fertilisers and grain - parts of the Black Sea grain deal that Moscow views as fundamental to extending the initiative beyond next week. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson said the US and the EU were putting up obstacles to Russias exports and it remained unclear whether Russia would extend its participation in the initiative.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update, saying: \"Russian efforts to repair the Crimean bridge continue but it is unlikely to be fully operational until at least September 2023.\" According to intelligence, the road bridge was closed yesterday to allow the movement and installation of a replacement 64-metre space. Three more spans will be required to replace the damaged sections. \"Although Crimean officials have claimed these additional spans will be in place by 20 December, a briefing provided to President Putin added that works to the other carriageway would cause disruption to road traffic until March 2023.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said Moscow had contacts with US officials from time to time, and confirmed there would soon be US-Russia consultations on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control agreement between the worlds two largest nuclear powers.\n\nUkraine has collated thousands of reports of its children being deported to Russia and wants their plight addressed at a summit of the Group of 20 major economies, Vladimir Zelenskiys chief of staff was quoted as saying on Tuesday. \"The Russian Federation continues to commit its crimes in connection with Ukrainian children,\" Zelenskiys office quoted Andriy Yermak as saying at a meeting he chaired of a group of officials responsible for child protection. \"The removal of children continues.\"\n\nThousands of Kyiv residents have signed a petition urging city authorities not to erect a giant tree during this years festive period, and instead to give money to the army and to people displaced by the war with Russia. The Kyiv tree, which in recent years has been set up in front of the 11th-century Saint Sophia Cathedral at the heart of the capital, is traditionally the main one in Ukraine at Christmas and New Year.\n\nRussia has been an \"active adversary\" of the UK for a number of years, the British defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace visited the Lydd army camp in Kent, where Ukrainian volunteers are being trained to fight in the war against Russia. The cabinet minister referred to the Salisbury novichok poisonings in 2016 and said the UK did not fear reprisals from Russia for supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe US basketball player Brittney Griner is being transferred to a Russian penal colony but neither her family nor legal team have any details on where she is or where she is going.\n\nSean Penn has given an Oscar statuette to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy said in his Tuesday night address that about 4 million people were without power in 14 regions plus the capital Kyiv, but on a stabilisation rather than an emergency basis. Scheduled hourly power outages would affect the whole of the country on Wednesday, said Ukraines electrical grid operator, Ukrenergo.\n\nThe general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces believe about 780 Russian soldiers were killed in the country in the last day.\n\nLandmines continue to cause serious harm to civilians working to restore a sense of normality in Kharkiv, which Ukrainian forces retook from Russian troops in May. Two road service workers, aged 21 and 51, were killed yesterday when their special equipment struck a mine during work in the Chuguyiv district, Oleh Syniehubov, the governor of Kharkiv oblast, said on Telegram. A 55-year-old man and 34-year-old man were also injured in the incident.\n\nRussian forces killed three and injured seven in the Donetsk oblast yesterday, the oblast governor said.\n\nZelenskiy called on Tuesday for an extension to the Black Sea grain export deal that lifted a Russian blockade of three major Ukrainian ports and eased a global food crisis. The accord, brokered by Turkey and the UN in July, expires on 19 November and looked in jeopardy in October when Russia briefly suspended its participation before rejoining. Ukraine also wanted the grain export deal expanded to include more ports and goods, and hoped a decision to renew the pact for at least a year would be taken next week, the deputy infrastructure minister said in a Reuters interview.\n\nAs the US went to vote on Tuesday in the 2022 midterms, Zelenskiy urged the US to stay united in its support and for US politicians to maintain \"unwavering unity\" and follow Ukraines example \"until peace is restored\".",

By comparison, 15,000 Soviet soldiers were estimated to have died in the 1979-89 Afghanistan conflict.\n\nUkraine has largely refrained from giving casualty figures. But in August, the armed forces' commander-in-chief, Valeriy Zaluzhniy, was quoted in Ukrainian media saying 9,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died so far.\n\nThe UN has said it does not consider figures released by those involved in the conflict to be reliable.\n\n\"There has been a tremendous amount of suffering, human suffering,\" said Gen Milley. He also also noted that between 15 and 30 million refugees have been created since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February.\n\nThe UN has recorded 7.8 million people as refugees from Ukraine across Europe, including Russia. However, the figure does not include those who have been forced to flee their homes but remain in Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, Moscow announced its troops would start to withdraw from the key southern city of Kherson - the only major city to fall to Russian forces.\n\nGen Milley said that while \"initial indicators\" suggested that a retreat had begun, he observed that Russia had amassed around 20-30,000 troops in the city, and the withdrawal could take several weeks.\n\n\"They made the public announcement they're doing it. I believe they're doing it in order to preserve their force to re-establish defensive lines south of the [Dnieper] river, but that remains to be seen,\" he said.\n\nThe news of Russia's withdrawal from Kherson comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin called up some 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine in September.\n\nMilitary experts in the West and Ukraine say the need for mobilisation showed that Russian troops were failing badly on the battlefield in Ukraine.",

Only during one day yesterday, 11 Shahed drones were destroyed,\" he said. \"We know for sure that Iranian instructors taught Russian terrorists how to use drones, and Tehran is generally silent about it.\"\n\n3:50 p.m.: Ukrainian attackers shot and seriously injured a judge in an eastern Russian-controlled region of Ukraine who sentenced three foreigners to death in June, a pro-Moscow official said on Saturday, Reuters reported.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the administrator of Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine's Donetsk region, said Alexander Nikulin had been injured late on Friday in the town of Vuhlehirsk to the northeast of the city of Donetsk.\n\nIn June, Nikulin passed death sentences on two Britons and a Moroccan who were captured while fighting for Ukraine, ruling they had tried to overthrow local authorities.\n\nThe three men were released in September as part of a major prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n3:40 p.m.: If Republicans win the House or Senate in the midterm elections next week, it can throw a wrench into the efforts of the Biden administration to defend Ukraine, The New York Times reports.

According to The Kyiv Independent, several explosions have been heard in Kherson.\n\nRussia is stepping up its evacuation of residents from the conflict zone it claims to have annexed.

His initiative, UNITED24 launched six months ago, has been the main venue for collecting charitable donations in support of Ukraine. \"We are grateful to everyone for supporting our values, for believing in [Ukraine] and our victory. We feel that the world is supporting [Ukraine], and this gives us strength in our struggle,\" he said.\n\n8:55 a.m.: Russia launched fresh drone attacks on targets in central Ukraine as Kyiv's forces fought battles in the east and Moscow-appointed authorities continued to evacuate people from Kherson in the south in an apparent preparation for a potential Ukrainian offensive, RFE/RL reports.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Saturday that its forces managed to stop Russian attacks the previous day in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, meanwhile, said it launched 11 strikes against Russian positions, while Ukrainian air defenses shot down an Orlan-10 drone, 11 Shahed-136 drones, and two Kalibr cruise missile according to RFE/RL.\n\nRussian troops have been actively using the Iranian-made drones in recent weeks to attack critical civilian and infrastructure targets.\n\n8:15 a.m.: Irans foreign minister on Saturday acknowledged for the first time that his country has supplied Russia with drones, insisting the transfer came before Moscows war on Ukraine, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe comments by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian come after months of mixed signals from Iran whether it sent drones to Russia that have blasted Ukrainian energy infrastructure and civilian targets.\n\n\"We gave a limited number of drones to Russia months before the Ukraine war,\" Amirabdollahian told reporters after a meeting in Tehran.\n\nPreviously, Iranian officials had denied arming Russia in its war on Ukraine. Just earlier this week, Irans Ambassador to the U.N. Amir Saeid Iravani called the allegations \"totally unfounded\" and reiterated Irans position of neutrality in the war. The U.S. and its Western allies on the Security Council have called on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to investigate if Russia has used Iranian drones to attack civilians in Ukraine.\n\n5:11 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russia is probably struggling to provide military training for its current mobilization drive and its annual autumn conscription intake.\n\nNewly mobilized conscripts likely have minimal training or no training at all, the update noted, and deploying forces with little or no training provides little additional offensive combat capability.\n\n4:15 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russias costly force generation measures will likely continue to weigh on the Russian economy and generate social tensions. Russian forces continued to prepare existing and new defensive lines in Kherson Oblast and to conduct offensive operations around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Donetsk City.\n\n3:07 a.m.: The Netherlands will supply Ukraine with tanks and other heavy military equipment with a total worth of $119 million, the Dutch defense ministry said on Friday, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Netherlands said it would spend about $45 million on T-72 tanks, as it cooperates with the United States and the Czech Republic on a shipment of 90 modernized Czech tanks.\n\n1:23 a.m.: Bulgaria's parliament Friday approved a deal to buy eight F-16 fighter jets from the United States in addition to another eight it ordered in 2019 but has not yet received, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe Balkan country, which has been a NATO member since 2004, has been looking for some years to replace its aging and dwindling fleet of Soviet-built MiG-29 planes.\n\nBut since Moscow's forces invaded Ukraine in February, it has been unable to buy spare parts or engines to service those planes from Russia.\n\nThe country paid $1.67 billion for the first eight F-16 jets from Lockheed Martin, hoping to receive them in 2023.\n\nBut their delivery has been delayed and Interim Defense Minister Dimitar Stoyanov has said they might now not arrive before 2025.\n\nIn order to guard its airspace, Bulgaria is looking for ways to rent or buy used fighter jets from Sweden or France.\n\nFor now, aircraft and crew from Spain, the Netherlands and the United States have taken turns helping with air policing, with six Eurofighter jets and 130 crew expected to arrive on a new mission in Bulgaria in mid-November.\n\n12:02 a.m.:\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

Confirmed speakers include HASC Chair Rep. ADAM SMITH (D-Wash.), Army Chief of Staff Gen. JAMES McCONVILLE, Lockheed Martin President and CEO JAMES TAICLET and Raytheon Missiles and Defense President WES KREMER. We look forward to seeing our NatSec Daily family there!\n\nSubscribe here | Email Alex | Email Matt\n\nGen. MARK MILLEY put Washington-Kyiv relations in tough spot after comments last week that the winter fighting pause could open the door to peace talks with Russia. The Biden administration has since mobilized to deliver a clear message to Ukraine: Milley didnt say what we really think.\n\nSpecifically, senior U.S. officials are telling their counterparts in Ukraine that the expected winter fighting pause doesnt mean talks should happen imminently. Instead, theyre relaying that Washington will continue to support Kyiv militarily as it launches the next phase of advances on the battlefield, Ukrainian and U.S. officials tell Alex along with LARA SELIGMAN and ERIN BANCO.\n\nThe scramble follows comments last week by Milley, the Joint Chiefs chair. The four-star general said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York that a victory by Ukraine may not be achieved militarily, and that winter may provide an opportunity to begin negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe general has spoken regularly with his Ukrainian counterpart, Gen. VALERIY ZALUZHNYY, including on Monday, according to a U.S. official. During the discussion, Zaluzhnyy did not express any concern or mention Milleys comments even once, the person said. The person, along with others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nStill, the flurry of calls and meetings with Ukrainians underscores the degree to which the administration is concerned about presenting a unified front on Ukraine and potential peace talks. Any prolonged public split among top U.S. officials could threaten the already delicate relationship between Washington and Kyiv at a key moment in the war.\n\nThe mixed messages in public and in private about whether the U.S. should begin to speak more seriously with Ukraine about peace talks with Russia are straining the Washington-Kyiv relationship, according to eight U.S. officials. While some top national security officials are adamant that now is not the time to begin discussing negotiations, especially after Kyiv retook a strategically important city last week, others believe the winter could provide an opportunity for diplomatic conversations to take place.\n\nMilleys comments echoed a broad sense inside the Defense Department that the coming winter provides a chance to discuss reaching a political settlement to end the war. Senior military officials believe Ukraine will be challenged to expel Russian forces from all occupied areas, as is Kyivs stated end goal. Thats especially the case in the Crimean peninsula, which has been held by Russia since 2014. The State Department, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork for eventual peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. The administration stresses it would only engage in such conversations alongside and in full consultation with their partners in Kyiv.\n\nThe National Security Council is the most resistant to the idea of talks, despite a smattering of aides who privately urge the U.S. to get Ukraine and Russia to the table. National security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN has occasionally agreed with their view on prioritizing Ukraine-Russia talks which is not conveyed directly to the Ukrainians but argues Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN wouldnt take negotiations seriously at this time and that the Ukrainian public would reject any efforts at dealmaking.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe Inbox\n\nBIDEN MEETS XI: President JOE BIDEN and Chinese leader XI JINPING met for three hours in Indonesia Monday to warn against Russias threatened use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine and promise to rekindle joint works on curbing climate change, per our own JONATHAN LEMIRE.\n\n\"I absolutely believe there need not be a new cold war,\" Biden told reporters after his first face-to-face meeting with Xi as the U.S. president. \"Were going to compete vigorously but were not looking for conflict. Were going to manage this competition responsibly.\"\n\n\"The world has come to a crossroads [and] we need to chart the right course,\" said Xi, whose words were translated into English. \"The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.\"\n\nThe bonhomie betrayed the simmering concerns over Taiwans future, as fears that China plans a forceful takeover of the democratically ruled island grow in Washington. Biden, however, tried to tamp down tensions, saying \"I do not think theres any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.\"\n\nROBERT DALY, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, dismissed Mondays meeting as \"a non-event.\"\n\n\"I dont see any sign that either country is willing to change its assessment of the other, its intentions or its goals. So theres a desire to understand [each other] which is good, but theres no indication that either country is yet ready to reconsider any of its positions,\" Daly said.\n\nTAKE IT EASY: Senior Indonesian politicians are calling on Western leaders to make concessions on criticizing Russia over the war in Ukraine in a last-ditch effort to avoid leaving the G-20 summit without a joint declaration, our own STUART LAU reported Sunday, citing three diplomats with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations.\n\nU.S., European, Australian, Canadian and Japanese officials are among those under pressure from Indonesian counterparts, all the way up to President JOKO WIDODO, to show \"flexibility\" and consider using less tough rhetoric in order for Moscow, the diplomats said.\n\nWidodo \"considers it a personal success\" if a G-20 declaration could be reached, one of the officials said, adding that the Indonesian leader has lamented repeatedly that he is chairing the \"most difficult\" G-20 summit ever. He is also hoping to avoid kicking Russia out and making it the G-19, which the G-8 did in the wake of Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea in 2014.\n\nWhat else should you be watching for at the G-20? Our own NAHAL TOOSI has the rundown.\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY BLINKEN TO QATAR: Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN is expected to attend a World Cup game in Qatar during the early days of the tournament. And by what were sure is sheer coincidence, hell also hold discussions with Qatari leaders as part of an ongoing strategic dialogue with the Middle Eastern ally, Nahal reports.\n\nBlinken is planning to attend the U.S. game against Wales on Nov. 21, according to a U.S. official familiar with the issue. The strategic dialogue session will take place the same day, a former U.S. official familiar with contacts inside the State Department said.\n\nA State spokesperson said there were no travel plans to announce. The three people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to go on the record and to describe sensitive conversations.\n\nUnclear still is who from the Biden administration will attend the closing ceremony, an important moment as it involves a symbolic handoff to the United States, which will co-host the next World Cup. Biden, however, is not expected to attend any of the Qatar event.\n\nBlinken and his colleagues have promised to put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy.

A congressional aide familiar with the process also told our own CONNOR OBRIEN last week that shelving a vote on the bill is on the table, but no decision had been made.\n\nIf the Senate punts, it would be the second year the chamber hasnt passed a bill of its own.

They will defend their positions as long as they have the ability to do so,\" said Oleh, 26, a battle-hardened major who has risen through the ranks since enlisting as a teenager 10 years ago. \"It will be a hard fight.\"\n\nKirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in Kherson region, said Thursday that he hoped Russian forces would put up a fight.\n\n\"If we leave Kherson, it will be a huge blow,\" he added, in comments broadcast by Russia's RT television.\n\nThe contest for the only provincial capital seized by Moscow in the full-scale invasion launched February 24 may be one of the most consequential of the war so far.\n\nFor Russian President Vladimir Putin, it would be another setback following a series of significant battlefield losses since mid-August.\n\nWith control of the Dnipro's west bank, military experts said, Ukrainian forces would have a springboard from which to seize a bridgehead on the east side for an advance on Crimea.\n\nCrimea is home to Russia's Black Sea fleet and Kyiv has made the peninsula's recovery its sworn goal.\n\nWere Kherson to fall in the counteroffensive, the experts added, it would also be a political humiliation for Putin, as Kherson is one of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine that he announced would be part of Russia \"forever\" with great fanfare September 30.\n\n\"It would be a massive blow, primarily politically,\" said Philip Ingram, a retired senior British military intelligence officer. \"And it would cost him [Putin] militarily. If the Ukrainians were able to get a bridgehead on the east side of the Dnipro, that would be even worse for the Russians.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians \"will be able to hammer the Russians defending the approaches to Crimea,\" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it appeared the Russians already had begun \"an organized, phased withdrawal\" from the Dnipro's west bank.\n\nItching to attack\n\nThousands of civilians from the city and surrounding areas have been evacuated to the east side of the Dnipro in recent weeks after Russian-appointed occupation authorities warned of the dangers posed by Ukrainian advances.\n\nOn Friday, Putin publicly endorsed the evacuation that Kyiv says has included forced deportations of civilians out of Russian-occupied territory a war crime which Russia denies.\n\nOccupation authorities also have relocated administrative offices and records to the east bank, and a Western source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said most Russian commanders had transferred their bases as well.\n\nThe U.S. official and Ukrainian commanders said the Russians had been reinforcing their front lines, including deploying recently mobilized reservists, in a bid to better protect the withdrawal.\n\nSome Ukrainian soldiers believe the poorly trained Russian reservists are being sent forward \"like lambs to the slaughter,\" while more experienced troops are digging into defensive lines further back, according to the U.S. official.\n\nAn orderly pullout could prove challenging for the Russians, requiring coordination, deception to conceal movements, communications discipline, and intense artillery barrages to suppress Ukrainian advances.\n\nBut Ukrainian troops could also face serious obstacles that could stall their takeover of Kherson, including booby traps and concentrated Russian artillery and rocket fire from the east bank, Hodges said.\n\nAs both sides fought intermittent artillery duels Friday, Oleh's 100-man unit took advantage of unusually mild weather to clean weapons and install floorboards in earth-and-log-covered bunkers that are lined with thermal insulation and feature portable generators and wood-burning stoves.\n\nThe unit, with six armored personnel carriers, took its positions in September after Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops back to Kherson's border with Mykolaiv province.\n\nOleh said the Russians were running short of time, as January would bring ice floes down the Dnipro that could block ferry operations.\n\nHe was impatient to strike the enemy's weak points to induce panic among reservists that could turn into a rout.\n\n\"If we don't start an attack, they will just keep sitting there,\" he said. \"The mobilized ones are good for us because they generate panic. Panic is infectious like a disease. It spreads.\"",

It said the withdrawal was completed by 5 a.m. Moscow time (0200 GMT) on Friday.\n\n\"The transfer of Russian troop units to the left bank of the Dnipro river has been completed,\" the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"Not a single unit of military equipment or weapons have been left on the right (western) bank. All Russian servicemen crossed to the left bank,\" it added. Russia, it said, had not suffered any loss of personnel or equipment during the withdrawal.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the status of the retreat but if true, the speed of the move, involving up to 30,000 men, would be significantly faster than either the United States or Ukraine expected.\n\nThe top U.S. general said on Wednesday he estimated that Russia had 20,000-30,000 troops to move across the river, and the pullout could take \"days and perhaps even weeks\".\n\nUkraine's defence minister told Reuters in an interview on Thursday he expected the withdrawal to take at least a week.\n\nBRIDGE 'BLOWN'\n\nAbandoning an occupied Ukrainian city that was founded by Empress Catherine the Great in the 18th century amounts to a humiliating defeat for Russia after years of touting its post-Soviet military clout.\n\nBoth the choreography and tone of the retreat, though, contrasted sharply with the much more chaotic defeats of the Russian army in Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region in September, six months into Russia's invasion of its neighbour.\n\nThis time, General Sergei Surovikin, the commander in chief of Russian forces, said it was futile to waste more Russian blood on Kherson.\n\nRussian state television showed what it said was the Antonivskiy bridge, the only nearby road crossing from Kherson to the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River. Russian military bloggers said it was probably blown up as Russian troops withdrew.\n\nPictures of the bridge showed a man standing with a bike before a missing section.\n\nPro-Russian war bloggers reported late on Thursday that Russian forces crossing the river were coming under heavy fire from Ukrainian forces. The defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had struck Dnipro River crossings five times overnight with U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia remained committed to achieving the goals of what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, and said Moscow still viewed the Kherson region as \"part of Russia.\"\n\nPeskov said the decision to retreat was taken by the defence ministry. Asked by reporters if it was humiliating for Putin, Peskov said: \"No.\"\n\nPutin proclaimed Kherson - and three other regions of Ukraine - as part of Russia in a triumphal ceremony in the Kremlin on Sept. 30. Ukraine, its Western allies and an overwhelming majority of countries at the U.N. General Assembly have condemned the declared annexations as illegal.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had adopted \"defensive lines and positions\" on the eastern bank of the river, which Moscow hopes it will be able to better supply and defend.\n\nReporting by Reuters Editing by Mark Heinrich\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON President Joe Biden says he expects U.S. aid for Ukraines fight against Russia to continue to flow whatever the still-undecided outcome of the midterm elections, where Democrats performed stronger than expected.\n\nThe president at a post-election press conference Wednesday brushed off concerns that Republicans, who are on track to take control of the House, will pull the plug. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who is in line to become House speaker if Republicans win the majority and has said Republicans will not write a \"blank check\" for Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked whether the aid would be uninterrupted given McCarthys remarks, Biden said, \"That is my expectation. And, by the way, weve not given Ukraine a blank check. Theres a lot of things that Ukraine wants [that] we didnt do.\"\n\nBiden also defended the level of aid sent as sufficient for Ukraine to protect itself against Russian President Vladimir Putins invasion without sparking a wider war a signal that hes unlikely to seek to expand that aid.\n\nBiden said he decided to deny U.S. aircraft to guarantee Ukraines skies because, \"Were not going to get into a third world war, taking on Russian aircraft and directly engage.\" In a reference to Ukraines request for the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, made by Lockheed Martin, Biden said hes denied the Ukrainians such missiles, \"because Im not looking for them to start bombing Russian territory.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure that theres a relationship that theyre able to defend themselves and take on what is purely the ugliest aggression thats occurred since World War II on a massive scale, on the part of Putin, within Ukraine. And theres so much at stake,\" Biden said, intimating that most Republicans agree with him.\n\n\"So, I would be surprised if Leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say theyre not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine,\" Biden said.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe administration has delivered billions worth of weapons and equipment from military inventories, like Lockheed-made HIMARS rocket launchers, and as of this week Raytheon Technologies-made NASAMS air defense systems.\n\nMcCarthys comments, in an interview last month with Punchbowl News, raised fresh questions about the resiliency of Americas support for Ukraine as a growing number of Republicans, particularly those aligned with former President Donald Trumps \"America First\" approach, question the need for federal spending abroad at a time of record-high inflation at home.\n\nSensitive to the political dynamics in Washington and the capitals of other nations supporting Ukraine, Biden has reportedly encouraged Kyiv to express openness to peace talks with Moscow. But when asked whether Russias withdrawal from Kherson this week could open the door to such talks, Biden said, \"it remains to be seen whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., vowed last month that Congress would pass additional Ukraine aid as part of the government funding bill in the lame duck session, potentially sparing McCarthy from an unwieldy debate within his caucus for the first several months of his possible speakership.\n\nThe top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, said in a statement the day after the election that the U.S. needs to provide Ukraine with additional capabilities, including the missiles that Biden noted he would not send.\n\n\"It is far past time for the Biden administration to provide Kyiv with all the weapons it needs, including longer-range ATACMS, to ensure Putin, and all aggressors, understand they cannot win unprovoked wars of aggression,\" the statement reads.\n\nStill, at a rally with Trump in Iowa last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., vowed that \"under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine.\" Trump, who is expected to announce his candidacy for a 2024 White House run later this month, himself criticized lawmakers for passing the $40 billion Ukraine aid package in May.\n\n\"The Democrats are sending another $40 billion to Ukraine, yet Americas parents are struggling to even feed their children,\" his Save America PAC said in a May statement\n\nMcCarthy, who himself voted in favor of a $40 billion Ukraine supplemental in May, has started to walk back his October remarks.\n\n\"Im very supportive of Ukraine,\" McCarthy told CNN on Sunday. \"I think there has to be accountability going forward. You always need, not a blank check, but make sure the resources are going to where it is needed.\"\n\nRELATED\n\nEven as the situation on the battlefield has turned in Ukraines favor, the war has shattered its economy and ability to provide government services. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to international donors last month for $38 billion to cover next years expected budget shortfalls, and an initial $17 billion to start to rebuild critical infrastructure, including schools, housing and energy facilities.\n\nAccording to Daniel Vajdich, a lobbyist who says hes been in touch with Ukrainian officials, Kyiv expects a GOP-led Congress to boost security aid, but given Republican reluctance about economic aid when the last aid package was drafted to shrink that pot of funding.\n\n\"The Ukrainians cant fulfill their energy needs with HIMARS and NASAMS,\" said Vajdich, the president of Yorktown Solutions. \"They need to sustain their society and overall government operations.\"\n\nMore broadly, Kyiv recognizes that they will have to engage with Republican skeptics and emphasize their efforts to be good stewards of U.S. aid.\n\n\"The nature of the conversation will have to change,\" Vajdich said. \"They recognize that with a Republican-controlled House they [would] have to do more explaining\" of confidence measures.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Election Day, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl predicted the \"considerable bipartisan support,\" particularly in the Senate, would endure. Lawmakers, he argued, understand the broader stakes for the globe when \"big countries believe that they can swallow up their smaller neighbors.\"\n\n\"Theres stakes for the United States and for the free world in standing up for Ukraine,\" Kahl said. \"And I think the fundamental logic of that argument is widely understood among both Republicans and Democrats, so Im confident well be able to maintain support.\"\n\nPutin, Kahl said, is banking that inflation, rising energy prices and war fatigue will fracture political support in the countries backing Ukraine, \"and so I think its incumbent upon all of us to signal to him, its not going to work,\" Kahl said.\n\nJoe Gould was the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

This Russian retreat is a major victory for Ukraine and a humiliating personal defeat for Putin, who just weeks ago declared that Kherson had joined Russia \"forever.\"\n\nThe decision to withdraw to the left bank of the Dnipro was announced via a televised briefing featuring Shoigu and General Sergei Surovikin, the Russian commander charged leading the invasion of Ukraine. Surovikin acknowledged that Ukrainian advances made it no longer feasible to resupply troops on the west bank and suggested pulling back to defensive positions across the river.\n\nSome Ukrainian officials reacted cautiously to news of the withdrawal. \"Actions speak louder than words,\" noted Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak in a social media post. \"Ukraine is liberating territories based on intelligence data, not staged TV statements.\" Others were more upbeat, with fellow presidential advisor Oleksii Arestovych declaring, \"Lets get it right. Russia is not withdrawing from Kherson. Russia is being beaten back from Kherson by Ukraines defense forces.\"\n\nArestovych is not wrong. Ukraine has been waging a methodical and highly effective counter-offensive in the region around Kherson since the summer months. This campaign has featured incremental gains along a broad front alongside precision airstrikes on bridges to cut the Russian army off from resupply. These tactics appear to have worn down Putins troops and paved the way for todays painful decision to withdraw.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nIf confirmed, Russias retreat from Kherson will be a hugely significant development that could serve as a turning point for the entire war. In terms of military strategy, the loss of Kherson leaves Moscow with little chance of achieving its stated goal of occupying key port city Odesa and seizing Ukraines entire Black Sea coastline. Instead, Putins invading army will find itself confined to the eastern half of Ukraine up to the Dnipro River.\n\nWhile Russias withdrawal will have a significant military impact, the loss of Kherson will resonate far beyond any immediate strategic implications. Kherson is the only regional capital captured by Russia since Putin launched his invasion almost nine months ago. The Kremlin has gone to great lengths to strengthen its grip on the city and surrounding region, ruthlessly crushing any potential opposition while imposing policies of russification and eradicating symbols of Ukrainian identity.\n\nKherson was one of four partially occupied Ukrainian regions to be illegally annexed by Russia on September 30 as Moscow sought to raise the political stakes of its invasion following a series of battlefield setbacks. The annexation ceremony took place amid much pageantry in the Kremlins imposing St. Georges Hall, with Putin himself delivering a fiery anti-Western speech before declaring the four regions to be irreversibly part of the Russian Federation. He now faces the embarrassing task of explaining why \"forever\" turned out to be less than six weeks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Putin does not appear in any hurry to accept the blame for the loss of Kherson. Instead, he was conspicuously absent from the carefully choreographed TV event announcing the Russian armys withdrawal. This is very much in keeping with Putins traditional aversion to bad news, which also saw him pass on responsibility for unpopular Covid-related decisions to local officials and regional governors.\n\nGiven the gravity of the situation facing the Russian army in Ukraine, even Putins much-vaunted propaganda machine may now struggle to shield him from criticism. The retreat from Kherson is the latest in a long line of defeats that have done much to shatter Russias reputation as a military superpower and raise questions about Putins leadership.\n\nDuring the first weeks of the invasion, Russia lost the Battle of Kyiv and was forced to withdraw from northern Ukraine. After months of minimal progress in eastern Ukraines Donbas region, Putin then suffered another crushing blow when a lightning Ukrainian counter-offensive succeeded in liberating most of the Kharkiv region in a matter of days. With morale now likely to plummet further, his invasion is in danger of unraveling completely.\n\nThe loss of Kherson will spark a fresh round of recriminations inside Russia as supporters of the invasion and regime officials search for guilty parties to blame for the debacle. The mood among regime loyalists and hardliners is already dark. Former Kremlin advisor Sergei Markov branded the decision to leave Kherson, \"Russias biggest geopolitical defeat since the collapse of the USSR.\" Meanwhile, influential pro-war Telegram account War Gonzo, which has over 1.3 million mostly Russian subscribers, described the announced withdrawal as, \"a black page in the history of the Russian army. Of the Russian state. A tragic page.\"\n\nPutin will now be hoping his beleaguered troops are able to dig in and defend a new front line along the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. He desperately needs to secure some breathing space in order to train and equip recently mobilized troops, but Ukraine appears in no mood to accept increasingly urgent Russian proposals for a fresh round of negotiations. Instead, Kyiv will seek to press home its obvious advantage.\n\nThe liberation of Kherson will provide the whole Ukrainian nation with a welcome morale boost and will also energize the international coalition of countries supporting the fight back against Russias invasion. Ukraine has held the military initiative in the war since July and has now once again demonstrated that it is more than capable of defeating Russia on the battlefield. Victory in Kherson will be seen as further proof that Ukraine can deal a decisive blow to Putins imperial ambitions if provided with the tools to do so.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

Civilians remaining in Kherson city should leave immediately as they are putting their lives in danger, he added.\n\nHis comments came after several pro-Kremlin bloggers posted videos and images that NBC News has verified of the Kherson administration building without the Russian flag, although the white, blue and red tricolor still appeared to be flying above several other government buildings.\n\nA classroom in the village of Arkhanhelske in the Kherson region Thursday. Bulent Kilic / AFP - Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a news conference Thursday that he thought that Ukraine must press on with its offensive to take the remaining territory in the Kherson area.\n\n\"I certainly believe that they have the capability to do that,\" he said. \"More importantly the Ukrainians believe they have the capability.\"\n\nRussia has fought for months to hang on to the pocket of land it holds on the west bank of the river that bisects Ukraine, as well as Kherson city, the only major Ukrainian city that Russian forces have captured intact, since the invasion began Feb. 24.\n\nMoscow declared at the end of September that it had annexed Kherson, along with the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzia regions after staging referendums that were denounced by Kyiv and the West as illegal and rigged.\n\nAnd it has poured in tens of thousands of troops as reinforcements in the region, which is also home to the huge Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper. The dam holds back an enormous reservoir and controls the water supply to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nHowever, late last month, Russian-installed authorities ordered residents to leave the city, saying in a statement on their Telegram channel that they should board boats across the Dnieper. They added that all departments and ministries of the Kremlin-installed administration should also evacuate.\n\nUkrainian forces have targeted the main river crossings for months, making it difficult for Russia to supply its huge force on the rivers west bank. Since bursting through the Russian front line at the start of October, they have advanced down the river.\n\nHowever, they have been cautious about whether Russia is, in fact, vacating positions in the area.\n\nYurii Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Ukraines Kherson regional council, remained cautious about the Russian forces intentions.\n\n\"Within Kherson city limits, the number of Russian checkpoints has been reduced, and the Russians have taken down their flags from some of the administrative buildings they have occupied,\" he told NBC News by telephone Thursday.\n\n\"We have information that there is still a lot of both Russian military personnel and equipment there,\" said Sobolevskyi, who is not based in the city but speaks regularly to people still living there. \"These actions could be a provocation to lure Armed Forces of Ukraine into a trap.\"\n\nUkrainian artillery troops prepare to fire toward Kherson late last month. Bulent Kilic / AFP - Getty Images\n\nMichael Kofman, the research program director in the Russia studies program at CNA, a Washington-area think tank, said in Twitter posts that the situation in Kherson was \"clear as mud.\"\n\n\"Russian forces seemed to withdraw from some parts, evacuated, and drew down, but also reinforced with mobilized personnel,\" he said in one of several posts on the subject, adding that the fighting there was \"difficult.\"\n\nDespite \"constrained supply,\" he said, Russia forces did not appear to be out of ammunition.\n\n\"To me the preponderance of evidence points to a Russian decision to steadily retreat from the right river bank and avoid being cut off there, while also trying to exact a high cost,\" he added.\n\nIf Ukraine were to force a Russian retreat from Khersons right bank, he said, it would bring Kyiv's \"systems within range of some ground lines of communication from Crimea.\"\n\nArtem Grudinin reported from Kyiv, Henry Austin from London and Courtney Kube from Washington.",

The next road crossing across the Dnipro is more than 70 km (43 miles) from Kherson city.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what had caused the bridge's collapse. Russia announced on Wednesday it was retreating from the west bank of the Dnipro River to the other side.\n\n9:33am: Russian strike on residential building kills at least five in southern Ukraine\n\nUkraine said Friday that at least five people were killed following a Russian strike on a residential building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, near the front line.\n\nThe attack came as Russia said it was drawing down troops from the nearby city of Kherson, the only regional capital Moscow's forces captured in Ukraine after they launched their February invasion.\n\nThe Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on social media that the toll had risen to five after the latest fatal attack on the city that has been battered for months by Russian forces.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the strike was a \"cynical response to our successes at the front.\"\n\n4:42am: Seoul denies report of arms deal with US for Ukrainian forces\n\nSouth Korea on Friday denied a report that it would sell artillery shells for use by Ukrainian forces, claiming the munitions - if the ongoing deal negotiation is finalised - will be for US forces only.\n\nThe United States was nearing an agreement to purchase 100,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery from Seoul which would be delivered to Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing \"US officials familiar with the deal\".\n\nWashington is Seoul's key security ally, and stations some 27,000 US troops in the South to help protect it from the nuclear-armed North.\n\nSouth Korea said Friday that while the arms deal with the US is ongoing, the shells are not meant to be delivered to Ukraine.\n\n3:59am: Japanese national killed fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers\n\nA Japanese man fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers against Russia was killed in combat on Wednesday, becoming the country's first confirmed casualty in the war, authorities in Tokyo said Friday.\n\nA foreign ministry official told AFP the man is believed to be the first Japanese national to have died in Ukraine \"since the invasion began in February\".\n\nJapan has for months urged its citizens to evacuate the war-ravaged nation and has issued its highest-level warning against travelling there.\n\nWhile no other details were provided by officials, Jiji Press reported that the man belonged to a squad fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly invited foreigners to his country to join an \"international legion\" that would fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russians.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

But the government in Kyiv was skeptical of the move.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday he ordered troops to retreat from Kherson to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River on the recommendation of the commander of Russia's forces in Ukraine, Gen. Sergei Surovikin.\n\n\"The decision to defend on the left bank of the Dnipro is not easy, but at the same time we will save the lives of our military personnel and the combat capability of our forces,\" Surovikin said in televised remarks as he presented a report on the Russian military campaign to Shoigu.\n\nThe announcement drew skepticism from Ukraine's government, which has previously suggested Russia could pretend to pull out of Kherson to lure Ukrainian forces into battle.\n\n\"We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight,\" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter following Wednesday's announcement from Moscow, slamming Russia's \"staged TV statements.\"\n\nLater in the day, President Biden told reporters that Moscow's withdrawal order was \"evidence of the fact that they have some real problems with the Russian military.\"\n\nUkrainian forces have been steadily advancing on the city. Kherson was the only regional capital seized by Russian forces after the February invasion. At the time, the Kremlin insisted Russia was in Kherson \"forever.\"\n\nThe loss of Kherson follows a string of other military defeats and retreats by Russia in eastern Ukraine. The city is the capital of the Kherson region, one of four Ukrainian territories that Moscow officially claimed to have annexed and incorporated into the Russian Federation on Sept. 30.\n\nMilitary analysts and Ukrainian intelligence officials have been warning that a battle for Kherson city would devolve into bloody urban warfare if Russia decided to try to defend the port at the base of the Dnipro River.\n\nFor weeks, Moscow-installed administrators in Kherson have repeatedly called on people to evacuate the city to the east bank of the Dnipro, saying a major Ukrainian assault was imminent. The evacuations moved civilians deeper into Russian-controlled territory. Some were bused to Crimea. Others were offered resettlement in the interior of Russia. There were reports of Russian troops looting offices and shops as they retreated.\n\nUkrainian forces had systematically blown up key bridges in and around Kherson, cutting off potential escape routes for Russian troops.\n\nJason Beaubien reported from Dnipro, Ukraine.

Metin Atkas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nRussia's withdrawal from a large chunk of Kherson in southern Ukraine is likely to be fraught with danger for both sides in the war, according to analysts, who said the battle for the region \"is not over.\" Russia said Thursday that its forces were starting to withdraw from the western bank of the Dnieper River that bisects the Kherson region, while Ukraine said its forces had already advanced four miles and liberated 12 settlements in the region since Wednesday the day Russia's top military officials announced they would pull Russian troops out of Kherson city and the surrounding area, and back to defensive positions on the other side of the river. Ukraine's government said it was skeptical of Russia's withdrawal, although its forces on the ground appeared on Thursday to be exploiting the opportunity to target large groups of Russian troops preparing to withdraw. One Ukrainian official in Kherson stated that as Russian forces moved their equipment to the eastern bank of the river, \"we destroy it.\"\n\nDamaged parts of Velyka Oleksandrivka town, in the Kherson region, on Oct. 24, 2022. Anadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAnalysts say the Kherson withdrawal is likely to throw up major challenges for both the Russians as they pull back from the region as well as for Ukrainian troops as they try to reoccupy Kherson city and the surrounding area. \"The battle of Kherson is not over, but Russian forces have entered a new phase prioritizing withdrawing their forces across the river in good order and delaying Ukrainian forces, rather than seeking to halt the Ukrainian counteroffensive entirely,\" analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Wednesday evening. The institute said the entire Russian contingent will take some time to withdraw across the Dnieper, and it's unclear whether Russian forces will be able to conduct the withdrawal in relatively good order under Ukrainian pressure. Britain's Ministry of Defense agreed that the withdrawal is likely to be fraught with difficulty, with Ukrainian forces that are trying to reoccupy and liberate the Russian-occupied part of Kherson also facing dangers in that endeavor. \"In retreating, Russian forces have destroyed multiple bridges and likely laid mines to slow and delay advancing Ukrainian forces,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update Thursday on Twitter. For Russia, the lack of passable bridges was likely to be a problem, it added: \"With limited crossing points, Russian forces will be vulnerable in crossing the Dnipro River. It is likely that the withdrawal will take place over several days with defensive positions and artillery fires covering withdrawing forces.\"\n\nFighting intensifies\n\nThere were already signs Thursday that fighting was intensifying in Kherson as Russian troops withdrew. Serhiy Khlan, a member of the Kherson Regional Council, said on Facebook that a large buildup of Russian troops had been blown up in Kakhovka in Kherson. Another Ukrainian official noted that Moscow hadn't asked Ukraine to create a \"green corridor,\" or safe route, for Russia to withdraw its troops from Kherson safely. Separately, Ukraine's southern command unit said Thursday that its forces had attacked \"two strongholds of the Russian occupiers, a column of enemy equipment and an ammunition depot\" as enemy forces build up in the area. \"As a result of the attacks, the Ukrainian defenders eliminated 125 occupiers, three enemy tanks, five units of armored vehicles and an ammunition depot in the Berislav district,\" it added. Berislav lies upriver from Kherson, on the same western bank of the river the bank from which Russian forces are set to withdraw. The southern command unit repeated claims that Russia was laying land mines and leaving road blocks, presumedly in a bid to obstruct Ukrainian forces looking to advance and reoccupy the area. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukraine's president, said Russians wanted to \"turn Kherson into a 'city of death'\" as they withdrew. While efforts to reoccupy Kherson might be fraught with danger, analysts say Ukraine's forces have executed a well-fought campaign to recapture Kherson from Russia. \"The Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kherson direction since August a coordinated interdiction campaign to force Russian forces to withdraw across the Dnipro without necessitating major Ukrainian ground offensiveshas likely succeeded,\" analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said Wednesday.\n\nA Ukrainian tank driver near the Kherson front in Ukraine on Nov. 9, 2022.

REUTERS/Viacheslav Ratynskyi Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday ordered his troops to withdraw from the occupied Ukrainian city of Kherson and take up defensive lines on the opposite bank of the River Dnipro.\n\nThe announcement marked one of Russia's most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war, now nearing the end of its ninth month.\n\nIn televised comments, General Sergei Surovikin, in overall command of the war, reported to Shoigu that it was no longer possible to keep Kherson city supplied.\n\n\"Having comprehensively assessed the current situation, it is proposed to take up defence along the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro River,\" said Surovikin, standing at a lectern and indicating troop positions on a map whose details were greyed-out for the TV audience.\n\n\"I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing - the lives of our servicemen and, in general, the combat effectiveness of the group of troops, which it is futile to keep on the right bank in a limited area.\"\n\nThe news followed weeks of Ukrainian advances towards the city and a race by Russia to relocate more than 100,000 of its residents by ferrying them to the opposite side of the river.\n\nKherson is the main city of the region of the same name - one of four Ukrainian regions which President Vladimir Putin proclaimed in September he was incorporating into Russia \"forever\", and which the Kremlin said had now been placed under Moscow's nuclear umbrella.\n\nShoigu told Surovikin: \"I agree with your conclusions and proposals. For us,the life and health of Russian servicemen is always a priority. We must also take into account the threats to the civilian population.\n\n\"Proceed with the withdrawal of troops and take all measures to ensure the safe transfer of personnel, weapons and equipment across the Dnipro River.\"\n\nThe announcement had been anticipated by Russia's influential war bloggers, who described it as a bitter blow.\n\n\"Apparently we will leave the city, no matter how painful it is to write about it now,\" said the War Gonzo blog, which has more than 1.3 million subscribers on Telegram.\n\n\"In simple terms, Kherson can't be held with bare hands,\" it said. \"Yes, this is a black page in the history of the Russian army. Of the Russian state. A tragic page.\"\n\nCompounding the sense of Russian disarray in Kherson, Moscow's number two official there, Kirill Stremousov, was killed in a car crash on Wednesday.\n\nStremousov was one of the most prominent faces of Russia's occupation. Ukraine viewed him as a collaborator and a traitor.\n\nIn a video statement only hours before his death, Stremousov denounced what he called Ukrainian \"Nazis\" and said the Russian military was in \"full control\" of the situation in the south.\n\nReporting by Reuters; Writing by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Jon Boyle and Jonathan Oatis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Hannibal Hanschke/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russian forces are stepping up their efforts to make life unbearable for civilians across the occupied southern Kherson region, where power was cut on Sunday night and Ukrainian officials warned that Russian troops were mining critical infrastructure even as they dig in to fight for their last bridgehead west of the Dnipro River.\n\nThe battle for Kherson City the only regional capital to be captured by Moscow since the invasion in late February has been looming for months. A Ukrainian counteroffensive launched at the end of August has reclaimed over 100 towns and villages and steadily closed in on Kherson while also pounding Russian supply routes, command centers and ammunition depots far from the front.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced, the Kremlin-appointed authorities for Kherson ordered the \"evacuation\" of all civilians last month a move that Ukrainian officials said was less about saving lives and more about clearing space for newly mobilized Russian troops to occupy. Since then, Russian forces have been destroying critical infrastructure, shuttering essential services and looting the city, according to residents and Ukrainian officials.\n\nUkraines military said in an evening update on Monday that Russian forces were \"taking measures to artificially create unacceptable living conditions for local residents, disconnecting electricity and communication.\"\n\nPetro, a 30-year-old who lives in the area, managed to get a message out late Sunday night, saying, \"They are making a desert out of the right bank of Kherson.\" Because of concerns about his safety, he communicated on the condition that his family name not be used.\n\n\"Today they blew up the power poles, so we have no light and no water,\" Petro added.\n\nWhile state media in Russia said that Ukrainian shelling had damaged the power lines, Yaroslav Yanushevych, the exiled Ukrainian head of the Kherson regional military administration, blamed Russian troops.\n\n\"It is impossible to quickly repair the power lines due to a lack of specialists and equipment,\" he said Sunday night. \"In addition, Russian invaders will not allow this to be done.\"\n\nThe Russian forces have also placed mines around water towers in Beryslav, Mr. Yanushevych said, referring to a town less than 50 miles from Kherson City and just north of a critical dam.\n\nRussian forces seized the road over that dam, next to the town of Nova Kakhovka, in the first days of the war, and it is the main artery across the Dnipro River still under the control of Russian forces. If Ukraine regains control of the area, they could prevent thousands of Russian soldiers from escaping.\n\nUkrainian forces are still meeting fierce resistance as they continue battling Russian troops arrayed some 30 miles to the north of the dam.\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials have accused each other of planning to blow up the dam. But military analysts have said that doing so would be logistically challenging and would not serve either armys interests because it would cause flooding and destruction on both sides of the Dnipro.\n\nStill, Ukraines nuclear regulator on Monday ordered an urgent review of the safety risks upriver at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant if the dam were to be damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian military high command said on Monday that the destruction of critical infrastructure was part of a coordinated campaign to undermine its forces and warned that Moscow had dispatched propagandists \"to shoot videos in the city on the topic of the alleged destruction of the civilian population.\"\n\nTop government officials in Kyiv have also said that Moscow might be trying to create the illusion of leaving Kherson to lure Ukrainian forces into brutal urban combat. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said that it still had seen no evidence that Russian forces were preparing to abandon Kherson.\n\nBut the Ukrainian authorities warned that Russian forces were stepping up the hunt for people helping to direct military strikes. The Russians have \"intensified raids and filtration measures among the local population,\" the National Resistance Center, a government agency supporting resistance efforts in occupied areas, said on Monday.\n\nSo-called filtration centers were set up by Russia to temporarily detain and screen Ukrainians and identify anyone perceived to pose a threat to Russias occupation efforts. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that Russian authorities had \"forcibly deported\" between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens to Russian territory,\n\nThe National Resistance Center said that it was aware of \"dozens of detainees\" who were being taken to camps, saying that once there, they would be interrogated and tortured. The claim could not be independently verified.",

                "cc_text": "Article by: Hans Petter Midttun\n\nMake no mistake: Russias aims on the war are unchanged. Its recent negotiation proposals, made without offering any concessions while upholding its strategic messaging and escalating the war, can only mean that it needs time to catch its breath before the next offensive.\n\nTwo events caught the worlds attention on 9 November.\n\nFirst, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announces its readiness for negotiations without any conditions \"taking into account the current state of affairs.\"\n\nSecondly, Russia decided to surrender the west bank of Kherson Oblast and withdraw its forces across the Dnipro River.\n\nThe decision to withdraw is seen as military sound in light of their logistic problems as a result of months of Ukrainian precision strikes against bridges, depots and concentration of manpower and equipment.\n\nThe Russian forces have been persistently pushed back in the face of an increasingly stronger Ukrainian counteroffensive. The 20,000 to 30,000 troops on the West Bank of the Dnipro river include some of Russias few remaining elite units, like elements of the 76th and 106th Airborne Assault Divisions and 22nd Army Corps.\n\nTrying to hold Kherson has been a major drain on Russian resources and has tied up some of its best troops at a time when theyre desperately needed elsewhere.\n\nRetreating across the Dnipro River to already prepared defensive positions will allow Russia to preserve some of its best and battle-hardened fighting formations, redeploy forces to other parts of the theatre and not last, hold the line as \"King Winter\" works its magic across Europe and gives Russia a respite while its force generation efforts make progress.\n\nWhile the decision marks a huge political defeat for President Putin, coming slightly more than a month after he announced the annexation of the region and after allegedly, previously having refused requests to withdraw, it is nevertheless supported by the Russian pro-war forces (Kadyrov, Prigozhin, propagandists and milbloggers).\n\n\"After weighing all the pros and cons, General Surovikin made the difficult but right choice between senseless sacrifices for the sake of loud statements and saving the priceless lives of soldiers,\" Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, who often urged to take a more aggressive approach in the war and even for the use of low-grade nuclear weapons, said.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, another war hawk and financier of the Wagner PMC which is conducting the more diffucult offensive operations, was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying: \"The decision taken by Surovikin is not easy, but he acted like a man who is not afraid of responsibility.\"\n\n\"Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of state media outlet RT, went even further, comparing the retreat to the decision by General Mikhail Kutuzov to abandon Moscow to Napoleon in 1812 for the sake of preserving his army and 1 11saving Russia,\" according to Reuters.\n\nAccording to ISW, President Putin has not commented on the withdrawal as of this publication, suggesting that the Kremlin is framing the withdrawal as a purely military decision.\n\nThe withdrawal has probably been a long time coming.\n\nThe Russian president rejected requests from commanders in the field to retreat from Kherson in September already.\n\nGeneral Sergei Surovikin, recently appointed as the new commander of the Russian army in Ukraine, was seen preparing the Russian public for the surrender of the occupied southern city of Kherson already in mid-October.\n\nParticularly, the Russian occupation authorities of Kherson Oblast had sent text messages to residents urging them to leave the city, shortly after General Sergei Surovikin told the state-run Rossiya 24 TV news channel that \"hard decisions must be made,\" Newsweek reported.\n\nThe decision to withdraw does not necessarily mean that the operation will be successful. It will involve an extremely complex, fighting withdrawal taxing for even the most professional Army. The Russian Armed Forces have proven itself anything but professional during the last 9 months of full-scale war.\n\nAccording to Mick Ryan, a retired major general in the Australian Army, withdrawals are designed to allow a force to disengage from opposing forces and redeploy on a new mission or to a new location while minimising casualties:\n\n\"Withdrawal is a task employed regularly during mobile defence or the delay to accomplish the overall aim of resuming offensive actionit should be treated as a routine tactic rather than a harbinger of disaster.\" \"What are the planning considerations? First, deception is vital. The reality is however that it is difficult to conceal from [Ukrainian] forces an intention to withdraw. At some point, it becomes obvious what will occur. However, some deception might be achieved by stepped-up patrols, increased fire support, decoys, simulating normal activities and communications discipline. For the Russians on the Dnipro west bank, this will be difficult but not impossible.\n\nA second consideration is how to sequence the withdrawal. This includes when and how to evacuate logistic stocks, headquarters, recon elements and ground combat forces. It will depend on where and in what strength Russian forces are pressing the force that is to withdraw. For the Russians, getting this sequence right will be vital. They will have to balance the preservation of their force with using it to hold off the Ukrainian advancing forces. They need enough forces to prevent a rout but not so much that they lose a large part of the force. The third issue for Russia will be disrupting the Ukrainians ability to interfere with the withdrawal. We should expect to see increased air defence, jamming and artillery used by withdrawing Russians, as well as greater air support. They may also use civilians as human shields. The fourth consideration will be command and control. This isnt just about who is in charge. It is about controlling an orderly withdrawal in the planned sequence. MPs are vital for road space control, route discipline and ensuring units dont vacate defensive positions early. In general, a withdrawing force will want to achieve what is called a clean break. This is disengagement of Russian forces in a way that avoids their ability to follow up and pursue the withdrawing force. The Dnipro River will be a key element of Russias clean break approach. Once again, getting the sequence for withdrawing troops right is critical in achieving a clean break. A lot of artillery (probably from the Dnipro east bank), jamming and air support will be required. And a lot of ferries to transport troops and equipment across the Dnipro. A key part of achieving a clean break is an effective rear guard. A rear guard force can help provide a clean break for the withdrawing force and prevent enemy pursuit. I would expect that for the Russians, the rear guard will consist of armoured and mounted infantry forces. These forces can move and fight rapidly and have a better chance of achieving a clean break and surviving to cross the Dnipro to fight another day. However, we might also see the Russians dump newly mobilised troops to stay, fight, delay and die to buy time for the withdrawal. Ultimately, a successful withdrawal requires excellent planning and coordination. But this is underpinned by good leadership. [] There is much that can wrong for them. And following on their heels will be a determined, aggressive Ukrainian ground force. The Ukrainians will be keen to destroy or capture as much as possible of the Russian force on the west bank of the Dnipro. Not only would these Russians not be able to resume offensive operations in the future, but it would also be a significant strategic influence success.\"\n\nThis is why the Russian newfound willingness to negotiate became relevant. It does not signify a willingness to end a 9-year-long war, but rather a recognition of the challenges and risks the withdrawal entails.\n\nRussia does not need negotiations to end the war. It simply needs to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine, unblock the Ukrainian ports, and stop all attacks on land, in the air and from the sea.\n\nPredictably, Ukraines Foreign Ministry rebuked the Russian negotiation proposals, calling to pay attention to actions, not words. As stated by its spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko,\n\n\"The only realistic proposal should be for Russia to immediately end the war against Ukraine and withdraw Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, beyond its borders as of 1991. [] People who want to negotiate do not destroy the countrys energy system so that its population freezes in winter; they do not engage in mass executions of civilians; do not shell residential areas; do not announce the mobilisation of an additional 300,000 military personnel; do not block grain supplies, and do not push forward any ultimatums.\"\n\nRussia is not offering peace. It is de facto escalating the war into a Total War.\n\nIt is mobilising 300,000 1,000,000 (exact numbers are not known) of its citizens for renewed efforts to defeat Ukraine. It is in the process of building a joint Russian-Belarusian force. It is waging an intense air campaign to destroy Ukraines energy sector at the onset of Winter.\n\nRussia is also waging energy and economical warfare against Ukraines international partners. It is using nuclear blackmail to stop the West from intervening militarily while repeatedly demanding NATO withdrawal from Eastern Europe.\n\nMore telling, we have seen no changes to the Russian strategic messaging. The aim and objective of the so-called \"special military operation\" remain unchanged. Russia still intends to \"denazify and demilitarize\" Ukraine.\n\nRussia still regards the actions of the United States and other unfriendly states as a threat to traditional values.\n\nDuring president Putins speech at the Valdai International Discussion Club meeting on 27 October the West was demonized and portrayed as the aggressor. The message to the non-Western countries was: Russia is fighting Western global dominance. Join us, or suffer the consequences of its efforts to colonise and enslave nations.\n\nIts \"new\" offer for negotiations, is, therefore, very much in line with Russias hybrid war strategy.\n\nIt appeals directly to the Western hope for a peaceful resolution (e.g. the Minsk Agreement that laid the foundation for the full-scale invasion in February) at \"minimum costs.\" It supports the US and NATOs desire to avoid military intervention in the war.\n\nHe started a war in 2014, using the Minsk Agreements and negotiations in an attempt to achieve its strategic aim and objectives.\n\nOn December 17, Russia published both a draft treaty between the USA and the Russian Federation \"on security guarantees\", as well as a draft agreement on \"measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and the Member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\". This was yet another attempt to \"negotiate\" a NATO withdrawal in support of its strategic aims.\n\nOn 29 October Russia halted its role in the Black Sea deal for an \"indefinite term\" claiming that it could not \"guarantee the safety of civilian ships\" after an attack on its Black Sea fleet. After first \"having committed a crime in the evening, it then proposed talks in the morning\". The following day, having again blocked global food supplies, Russia declared itself ready to negotiate with the West \"on certain conditions\". It was referring to the documents that were submitted to both Brussels and Washington on 17 December 2021 demanding \"security guarantees\" through a NATO withdrawal.\n\nIts last offer to negotiate without offering any concessions, upholding its strategic messaging and escalating the war must be seen as what it is: A smokescreen and an attempt to achieve its strategic aim and objectives through negotiations.\n\nThe fact that the initiative coincides with its decision to withdraw from the west bank of Kherson might, however, offer some insight into Russian strategy.\n\nKremlin needs a strategic pause to prepare for the next offensive.\n\nThe attack on the Kerch bridge greatly increased existing Russian challenging in sustaining operations in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.The bridge is not expected to be fully operational again before the spring at the earliest (September 2023 in the worst case).\n\nRussian forces have demonstrated anything but effective command and control, leadership and high motivation during the last 9 months of warfighting. A fighting withdrawal might very well be beyond their ability. \"It wont take them a day or two, this is going to take them days and perhaps even weeks to pull those forces south of that river.\" They run the risk of losing up to 30,000 soldiers, elite forces and their military equipment, further fueling public resentment in Russia.\n\nHuge losses will have a tremendous impact on its ability to relaunch its offensive against Ukraine next year. The military forces presently in Kherson are not only crucial to stopping the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv and Luhansk oblasts but also constitute the core which the newly mobilised will be formed around. Ukrainian intelligence indicates that some are planned to be redeployed to Belarus to potentially open up a new front in Western Ukraine to cut Western supplies.\n\nWhile many of the newly mobilised personnel were sent to the frontline with limited or no training to stop the Ukrainian advance at all costs, the great majority are still undergoing training. While Russias ability to equip the new formations are questionable, they still need 2-3 months to become effective military units. Russia, therefore, needs a reprieve to complete the force generation process and conserve and rest the existing battle-hardened, exhausted and demotivated forces.\n\nLastly, Russia still needs \"King Winter\" to influence Western resilience and resolve. Seeing signs of increasing public discontent and a changing political landscape as recession and higher costs of living takes hold across Europe, Russia has every reason to pause the war.\n\nFrom a Russian perspective, spring brings hope for new success.\n\nFor Ukraine and the West, the Russian conundrum offers a unique chance to break the back of the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nAll hopes for negotiations must be dashed. This is the moment to enforce the international will on Russia.\n\nToo bad Ukraine does not possess more HIMARS, combat aircraft, helicopters and other long-range fires to guarantee a Russian defeat while attempting a fighting withdrawal.",

Eyster has refused to publicly comment on any aspect of the case, including the fact that investigators are looking into a sexual assault case, the second such police misconduct case to rock local law enforcement and the town of Ukiah this year.\n\nUntil now, the investigation has been labeled a criminal complaint, but the Attorney Generals letter specifically identifies sexual assault.\n\n\"The investigation arose from a complaining witnesss June 13, 2022, complaint to the Mendocino County Sheriffs Office that Mr. Waidelich sexually assaulted her while he was on duty,\" according to the AGs letter.\n\nEysters secretive handling of the Waidelich case was eventually questioned publicly because three weeks after the sexual assault complaint was made against the police chief the DA approved a controversial plea deal dropping sexual assault charges against a former Ukiah police sergeant once under Waidelichs command.\n\nDisgraced Sgt. Kevin Murray, under the terms of that deal, was placed on probation rather than serving jail time as advocated by probation officers. In addition, Eyster in 2017 was named a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed by a former county probation officer and live-in partner of the fired police chief. She complained the DA personally orchestrated a campaign to force her out as a local law enforcement representative after she accused Waidelich of abusing her. Eyster eventually succeeded in getting dismissed from the still pending lawsuit, citing state provisions that District Attorneys immunity from decisions they make on the job.\n\nSince then, a possible outcome of the high-profile Waidelich case has dogged the former police chief, city officials, and Eyster. The lack of any public statement by prosecutors, and the fact that details of the case are still under wraps months after the complaint was filed, has only exacerbated public concerns about the second local police misconduct case to be aired this year.\n\nThe state Attorney Generals Office, after reviewing Eysters bid, wrote in a letter to the DA dated Nov. 3 that \"the perception of a conflict does not require recusal or disqualification of the local elected prosecutor.\"\n\nJeffrey Laurence, Senior Assistant Attorney General in San Francisco, said a recusal inquiry must focus on whether there is evidence demonstrating likelihood that the Waidelich investigation will not be handled in a fair manner by the Mendocino County District Attorneys Office, and not on how proceeding with the local prosecutor may appear to the public.\"\n\n\"The request for the Attorney General to assume this investigation is based solely on the concern that the public might perceive an appearance of a conflict of appearance in this matter,\" said Laurence.\n\nLaurence, in tossing any decision about Waidelich back to Eyster, said, \"We appreciate the concerns about appearances you have raised but we do not find a recusable conflict that would disqualify you your office from handling this investigation.\"\n\nLaurence said the AGs office understood that the DA seemed to be worried about public perception that \"your office might provide a high-ranking law enforcement suspect more favorable treatment, as opposed to pursuing an impartial assessment of the facts of the case.\"\n\n\"And you have raised the concern that various competing interests could be perceived by the general public as affecting any charging decision with respect to Mr. Waidelich,\" said Laurence.\n\nLaurence, said, \"However, those appearances do not constitute a recusable conflict, and we are confident you and your office will exercise your prosecutorial discretion in evaluating this case in the same fair, impartial, professional, and even-handed manner with which you assess all investigations presented to your office.\"\n\nWhat Eyster will do now is unclear.\n\nThe woman involved is a well-known by local law enforcement officials, and if a friend of many. She has declined to speak publicly about her experience with Waidelich.\n\nWaidelich, his team of attorneys who include former Judge James King and Ukiah lawyer Steve Johnson, all have declined comment about the case.\n\nDA Eyster did not respond Tuesday for comments about the state AGs determination.\n\nLake County Steamboat, 1875\n\nEMPLOYEES TO SUPERVISORS: DO YOUR JOB\n\nby Mark Scaramella\n\nThe slo-mo train wreck that we have become accustomed to watching since Big Momma Carmel Angelo retired in March seems to have stalled. Say what you will about former CEO Angelo, but she wouldnt have allowed the aimless inertia this leaderless Board of Supervisors has fallen into.\n\nSo little gets done anymore besides lots of talk and reports that the locomotives seem out of steam, about to come to a sputtering stop in their tracks or disappear on an abandoned spur line before they even get close to any kind of dramatic train wreck.\n\nCommenting on facebook about our recent item about how few Board meetings are scheduled for the rest of the year, Supervisor Ted Williams took his familiar, dismissive tone instead of attempting any kind of sustentative response:\n\nWilliams: \"Board is not taking a month off. Giving more and more direction to staff, week after week, isnt a recipe for success. Mark is in the dark if he thinks board meetings are the entirety of work, but the AVA is about selling stories more than truth-telling.\"\n\nWilliams is right that \"more direction to staff\" isnt working. But aside from the typical \"youre lying about us\" whining without providing any examples, we are supposed to take Williams at his word that the Supes are working really really hard.\n\nThats not how the Countys own employees see the Board, however.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, County employee union rep Patrick Hickey provided as good an answer as we could to Williams inane claim.\n\nHickey: \"You have a general fund reserve. You can only use that reserve if you have an emergency. Well, we are in an emergency. We are in an official emergency. You can tap those funds to support your staff to stop the hemorrhaging [of people leaving out of frustration or because of low pay]. Family and Children Services [Food stamps, Medi-Cal and employment assistance] are shutting units down. Mandated services that this County is required to provide they are not able to provide. If the state actually did their job they would probably turn the lights out here in Mendocino County. They would say, Sorry you are not doing the job you are supposed to do. We have been giving you money and you are not using it. We are offering you money, and you are not asking for it. Half of the County is state and federal funding. But we have people that are not being paid at market. That makes absolutely no sense. The County has made no proposals at the table for six months to deal with that. They [the expensive attorneys the County has hired to \"negotiate\" with the union] sit there and stare at us and say, We don't know what's happening; we don't know what we're supposed to do, we don't know what's in the budget you tell us. No! That's your job! We have been waiting for six months for you to do your job, so do your job!\"\n\nThe room full of County employees erupted in loud and extended applause. (Note the hand-written sign from one employee who urged the board to \"stop stalling.\")\n\n* * *\n\nIn case there was any doubt about why these supervisors have been trying to put the auditor/tax collector on the spot these last few weeks, Supervisor Glenn McGourty made it as clear as he could Tuesday morning that he wants the public and the employees to blame Auditor-Tax Collector Chamise Cubbison for their failures:\n\nMcGourty: \"We really genuinely do not know how much money we have to work with. A quick civics lesson: Our Auditor Controller Tax collector Treasurer is an elected official. She does not answer to us. We have to have good information provided by her. She has not done it! We are waiting! That's what's holding us up! That's all that's holding us up! So have a conversation with her! Urge her! Encourage her to take help. We have offered help. We are trying really really hard [sic] to make this work.\"\n\nMcGourty conveniently ignores the negligent role that he and his colleagues and their CEO and her department heads have in this process.\n\nBut when the subject of the one senior assistant their Auditor-Tax Collector needs now the one the Board promised to expedite at the last meeting, the \"help\" that McGourty says has been \"offered\" arose a few minutes later, Ms. Cubbison called in under public expression.\n\nCubbison: \"I didn't see the information I requested from Human Resources until this morning. I don't really agree with the direction that HR is recommending. Apparently they did not hear my concern about limiting the applicant pool based on the classification. I feel strongly that a Program Administrator [that HR proposed] is not going to get me in the direction of a more analytical position. That is not at all what I'm looking for for the Treasurer Tax Collector office. It sounds like we are going back to the drawing board in this discussion with Human Resources.\"\n\nAgain, the Board feigned concern and said they wanted to help. Nobody disagreed with Ms. Cubbison. Instead they turned the question back to Mr. Schurtz, Mendos Human Resources manager, who went on and on about the difficulties of a lengthy process of creating a new \"classification\" for the position Ms. Cubbison wants. County Counsel Curtis offered only vague promises that hed look into the matter to see if there was any way to get around the tedious classification process. Nobody had any idea how to streamline or speed up the that process, much less actually hire someone, or what it would take to provide Ms. Cubbison with the person she needs now for her understaffed and overworked office. In the end, all they could come up with was a vague idea from Supervisor Dan Gjerde who offered to suggest a few names of people who worked in the Auditor's office years ago who might be contacted to see if theyd consider coming back as extra help.\n\nSTILL LOOKING FOR RENTER/CARETAKER IN PHILO\n\nOur mom is in her early 70s and lives in Philo on Nash Mill Road (on the lower portion, only mile from Hwy 128). Her memory problems are becoming more severe. We purchased a park model RV tiny house that we are working to place and set up -- we hope to have it ready and available for a renter by early December. The tiny house is a 1-bedroom, 400 sq ft home.\n\nThe renter/caretaker would share the south side of the property with the Spanish-speaking property caretaker.\n\nOur mom mostly stays at home and takes care of her animals, including chickens, cats, and a dog. She loves her property and is independent and free-spirited.\n\nIf interested, please contact her daughter Karen Verpeet at kverpeet@gmail.com (mailto:kverpeet@gmail.com) or 510-301-6256.

We are especially sad that after 3 years of hiatus related to the pandemic, we wont be able to see him at in-person camp in 2023. Many people are posting memories and condolences on Facebook.\n\nFor those of you who dont know this history, Mickie founded Lark Camp in 1979. For many years, Mickie also ran Lark in the Morning, an instrument store with locations in Mendocino, San Francisco and Seattle that boasted an exhaustive catalog of instruments from around the world. Mickie named the camp after the store, and then when the store sold, simplified the name to what we call it nowLark Camp. You can read about some of Mickies exploits as a street musician here.\n\nWe look forward to being at Lark Camp together in 2023, to share our grief and memories of Mickie and take comfort in each others camaraderie. We are forever grateful for the musical magic of Lark Camp that Mickie created.\n\nhttps://www.larkcamp.org/about/\n\nClearlake, 1890s\n\nARTISTS OF ANDERSON VALLEY - AV OPEN STUDIOS VETERANS DAY TOUR\n\nHave you ever looked at a work of art or a finely crafted piece of jewelry and wondered how the artist made that? You can get the answer to such questions while visiting the studios of some of Anderson Valleys best artists throughout the Veterans Day Weekend, Nov. 11, 12 and 13, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe Artists of Anderson Valley Open Studios event includes eight locations stretching from Boonville north to Navarro. This self-guided tour is free to the public and open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. An online tour map at artistsofandersonvalley.org and signs along Highway 128 will guide the way.\n\nThis 20th anniversary of Anderson Valley Open Studios again offers the unique opportunity to meet the artists and see the personalized environments in which their art is made. This years tour showcases the work of 11 artists working in a variety of artistic media, including: ceramics, jewelry, photography, textile, painting, printmaking, collage, and sculpture.\n\nThe artists participating this year are in Boonville and along Hwy. 128 between Philo and Navarro.\n\nIn Boonville, follow the map to the studio locations for Rebecca Goldie (paintings and found object sculptures) and Martha Crawford (collage works). Next, going north on Hwy. 128 take the second turnoff for Anderson Valley Way (at the history museum red schoolhouse) then turn left to visit the studios of Antoinette von Grone (paintings and photographs of animals, people, nature and whimsy) and Saoirse Byrne (intriguing one of a kind cordage works).\n\nHeading north past Philo, the action fans out from Hwy. 128 at the intersection with Clark Road and Holmes Ranch Road. A turn onto Clark Road quickly brings you to the historic barn studio of Colleen and Marvin Schenck (jewelry, collage, painting and printmaking). Nadia Berrigan (photography) is also showing with them as her own studio is isolated.\n\nAcross the highway, about a mile up Holmes Ranch Road the visitor will find the marker for the forested driveway that takes you over Mill Creek to Jan Wax and Chris Bings porcelain and stoneware pottery studio. Back on Hwy. 128 again, head north, after a mile, start looking to the left for Rebecca Johnsons big studio barn filled with sculpture and paintings.\n\nA little further north on the highway, also on the left, Doug Johnsons Pepperwood Pottery is marked by a large colorful ceramic mural.\n\nFor the artists, opening their studios is an opportunity to showcase their creativity and share the studio spaces lovingly developed to foster the creation of their art. Hopefully, you will take some of that creative energy home with a special new artwork for your own collection.\n\nED NOTES\n\nYOU QUALIFY as a Valley old timer if you remember Madge Gibson every Veteran's Day without fail out in front of the Boonville Post Office exchanging paper red poppies for Vet donations.\n\n\"NOSE CHANDELIER,\" a new term to me, and one that made me laugh, as I and every other geezer wonder why a pretty girl would want to deface herself like this.\n\nThis particular young woman was involved in the infamous Settler murder case out of Laytonville's deep outback, a full account of which is available in a new podcast described and posted elsewhere in this morning's ava news.\n\nI WOULDN'T ORDINARILY recommend a movie re-creation of Jeffrey Dahmer's uniquely depraved life, but this Netflix series is so brilliantly acted even vegetarians are likely to get sucked in. I tried to watch it a couple of weeks ago, but was put off by the murky opening scene of Jeff's neighbor confronting him about the \"smell coming from your apartment.\" I thought to myself, \"Uh, do I really want to watch this story whose outcome we all know, on a perfect Fall afternoon, the birds singing, the trees turning brilliant yellows and reds?\" At the time I decided, No, I'd rather go outside. Then I read somewhere that the Dahmer saga was Netflix's all-time draw so I just had to see if it was as good as all that. It is, and then some, though the righteous race lectures occupying too many episodes at the end coulda, shoulda been cut, imo, since the fact that our hero preyed on young black and brown men (and at least one 14-year-old boy) made the racism implicit. No need to take two hours to make the point that the Milwaukee police department of the time 78-91 was dominated by oafs and incompetents. The series is pretty heavy going in some parts when, for instance, Jeff, an otherwise model tenant \"who always paid his rent on time,\" offers his complaining neighbor a peace offering sandwich containing guess what? The poor woman was dealing with a constant stench \"Just some old pork chops gone bad,\" Jeff explained, not bothering to explain the late night thumping as he subdued his victims and went to work dismembering them with drills and electric saws. The most chilling passage, to me, was a verbatim recording of the police call from an astounded black woman complaining that the police had just returned a drugged, battered, obviously underage kid to Dahmer's custody. To conclude, this thing is a truly excellently done rendition of a horrifying series of events by one more lonely monster produced by world headquarters of lonely monsters.\n\nSYMPHONY OF THE REDWOODS OPENING CONCERT!\n\nGet your tickets at brownpapertickets.com, Out of this World in Mendocino and at Harvest Market in Fort Bragg for Symphony of the Redwoods Opening Concert!

Hosted by journalist Sam R. Anderson, Crooked City: The Emerald Triangle examines the complex story behind a grisly murder in an area of Northern California known as The Emerald Triangle, home to the nations outlaw culture of marijuana growing. The first two episodes are available now and subscribers to The Binge can listen to all episodes today.\n\nCrooked City: The Emerald Triangle showcases an incredible cache of original law enforcement audio tapes surrounding the murder investigation, allowing listeners to step foot inside the interrogation room and ride along with detectives as they solve the mystery.\n\nAfter moving back to his family home in the sleepy suburb of Ringwood, New Jersey, Sam Anderson learns that one of his high school classmates has been arrested for murder in The Emerald Triangle. Its a legendary place in the mountains of Northern California where most of the marijuana grown in the US comes from. People who have been there describe it as a hippie nirvana that promises freedom, money and an escape from the expectations of everyday life.\n\nFollowing in his classmates footsteps, Sam travels West to the small town of Laytonville where the murder took place. Desperation, greed and a seemingly never-ending acid trip created a perfect storm of paranoia that the locals refer to as \"hill crazy,\" culminating in a moment of unspeakable violence. He learns that the promise of freedom comes at a very high price.\n\nIf you have an Apple device, you can Subscribe to The Binge for all Ten Episodes.\n\nPrevious AVA Coverage:\n\nSTEVE HEILIG: The eclipse was rained out this time, so here it was as I caught it a few years back\n\nFEAR STALKS THE YOUNG\n\nEditor:\n\nLosing faith As a junior at Santa Rosa High School, I hear horrifying stories from my peers, regardless of their gender or sex.

I knew it was a threat, but I never felt it truly concerned me.\n\nCome high school it seems as though every fifth person I talk to has at least one story of being assaulted or almost abducted or a close friend having an experience like that. After getting into the dating pool, pessimism really sets in. If youve never had your loved one confide in you about what people have done to them, it is heart crushing and optimism shattering. I lose more faith and trust in humanity each day.\n\nAs a man, I see girls and guys my age afraid and anxiously looking over their shoulders.

Officers responded and searched the building for potential suspects and found none.\n\nOfficers observed that an exterior door had been pried open by the suspect to gain entry. Officers contacted County employees in order to determine what may have been stolen by the suspect. An initial check revealed that multiple laptop computers appeared to be missing. UPD Officers were able to obtain video surveillance footage of a male suspect taken inside the building earlier that morning.\n\nFollowing their initial investigation, Officers briefed UPD Detectives on the burglary. Detectives responded to the area to search for the suspect and stolen items. At approximately 10:39 AM, a Detective searching the area of the creek bed south of the County building located a male subject, identified as Justin Williamson, 40, of Fort Bragg, sitting beneath a bridge. The Detective saw that Williamson was wearing the same distinctive hooded sweatshirt and appeared to match the subject depicted in the surveillance video. Williamson also had two laptop bags at his feet.\n\nJustin Williamson\n\nThe Detective placed Williamson under arrest and searched Williamson and his property. Williamson was found to be in possession of several laptops, an electronic tablet, multiple cellular phones, and sets of car keys all determined to be County property. Williamson was also in possession of a methamphetamine pipe.\n\nWilliamson was transported to the MCSO jail where he was booked on the above listed charges. All stolen recovered property was returned to County of Mendocino employees that day.\n\n(Ukiah Police Department)\n\n========================\n\nDRUGS, GUNS, AMMO, INTOXICATION, BIZARRE BEHAVIOR, ETC\n\nOn Sunday, October 30, 2022, at approximately 5:38 PM, UPD Officers were dispatched to 217 Irvington Drive for a report of a male subject, later identified as Ryan Kotterman, 42, of Ukiah, acting erratically.\n\nRyan Kotterman\n\nOn arrival Officers contacted Kotterman. Officers observed him displaying symptoms of drug influence and placed him under arrest for public intoxication. Kotterman was also found to be in possession of a methamphetamine pipe. Kotterman was transported to MCSO jail where he was booked. Officers learned from a tenant at the residence that Kotterman had been displaying bizarre behavior and speaking incoherently. The tenant also advised that it was believed that Kotterman owned firearms and he had previously been seen in possession of a handgun.\n\nOn 10/31/22 officers were called back to the residence. Officers were given a handgun believed to be Kottermans that had been located by a tenant, inside the common area of the residence following his arrest the day prior. Officers were shown the handgun and observed it was an unserialized Glock style pistol (Ghost gun) that was loaded with several rounds of 9mm ammunition in a high-capacity magazine. The handgun was collected as evidence.\n\nOfficers learned that Kotterman had prior felony convictions and was thus prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition. Officers contacted UPD Detectives and, based on the above information, a search warrant on Kottermans residence was obtained.\n\nOn 10/31/22, UPD Detectives served the search warrant. During the search Detectives located a gun safe in Kottermans room. The safe contained numerous firearms including a .22 caliber pistol that had previously been reported stolen in a different state. Detectives also seized several hundred rounds of ammunition of various calibers.\n\nKotterman, who had already been released from jail following his arrest the day prior, was contacted by Detectives and was taken into custody. Kotterman was booked a second time at the MCSO jail where he was held on $25,000 bail. Kotterman posted bail and was released the following day.\n\nUPD is also requesting that the District Attorney file additional charges on Kotterman for Criminal Threats/Felony and Indecent Exposure/Misdemeanor) based on the statements provided by involved parties, during the course of the investigation.\n\nMail Carriage, Lake County\n\n2022 ROBE SHUFFLE\n\nPresiding Judge Jeanine Nadel has announced the judicial assignments for 2023.

NOW!\n\nWarmest spiritual greetings, I need to move on from the Building Bridges homeless shelter in Ukiah, California, where I took up residing after the marijuana trimmers put me out of the place that I was living for 13 months. Nobody there was interested in developing a spiritual political community living environment. It could have been amazing. But it didn't go anywhere.\n\nTherefore, after being in the homeless shelter since March 1st, bottom lining the trash & recycling voluntary chore, while sending out a steady flow of messages to say that I am available on the planet earth for spiritually oriented direct action in the name of radical environmental and attenuating peace & justice issues, I'd like to move on.

But with vote counting still ongoing, many races are still too close to call and it is still not clear if Democrats will retain their narrow majorities in the House and Senate or if Republicans will take control.\n\n(voanews.com)\n\nWHEN WELL KNOW: The Remaining Key Factors in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona\n\nWho will control the Senate and the House? Settle in for a long wait.\n\nby Nate Cohn\n\nFor the second Election Day in a row, election night ends without a clear winner.\n\nIt could be days until a party is projected to win the House of Representatives.\n\nIt could be a month until we know the same for the Senate.\n\nHeres the state of the race for both chambers and when maybe, just maybe well know the outcome.\n\nThe House\n\nRepublican control of the House was all but a foregone conclusion heading into Tuesday, but Democrats outran the polls and projections.\n\nRepublicans will have to claw their way to a majority, seat by seat. The Needle suggests Republicans are likelier than not to win the House, but it is no certainty. As of 5 a.m. Wednesday, there was only enough information to have them projected to win 197 seats 21 short of the 218 needed for a majority.\n\nTheyre nowhere close to being called the winner in many of these races in many of these states, late mail ballots have the potential to help Democrats. It will take days to count these ballots.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats lead in another group of races where Republicans might wind up mounting a comeback.\n\nThe Senate\n\nThe fight for control of the Senate will come down to four states: Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Arizona.\n\nWisconsin is the only one that could be resolved by early this morning. The Republican Ron Johnson led by just over one percentage point at 7 a.m. Eastern, with 94 percent of the vote counted. A handful of counties might still have a modest number of absentee ballots to report, which could let the Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes close some of the gap. Either way, the number of absentee ballots should be ascertained fairly quickly. They ought to be counted fairly quickly as well.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Georgia, which seems unlikely to be resolved before a Dec. 6 runoff election. A New York Times analysis of the results by precinct and state absentee files suggests that Senator Raphael Warnock (who leads) is unlikely to reach the 50 percent necessary to avoid the runoff, barring an unusual number of provisional or late mail ballots. Unlike in 2020, there werent many absentee ballot requests this year.\n\nIf Wisconsin goes for Mr. Johnson and Georgia is stuck in runoff purgatory, theres only one way for the Senate to be decided quickly: One party wins both Arizona and Nevada. It appears neither will do that soon.\n\nOf the two, Nevada is the clearer case. Still, the race is too close to call. The Republican Adam Laxalt leads the Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto by 2.7 percentage points at this hour, but most of the remaining vote is expected to be Democratic-leaning mail ballots and provisional ballots, including from same-day registrants.\n\nThe Needle suggests a close race, but much remains uncertain, as the exact number of outstanding ballots is unclear. The turnout in the state appears fairly low, suggesting that a large number of ballots might remain. It is also unclear how long it will take to count them. Last time around, Joe Biden was projected to win only on Saturday, even though he won by a fairly comfortable two points and seemed poised to gain in the late ballots. At this point, such a clear path to victory seems unlikely for either candidate.\n\nThe situation in Arizona is even less clear, but here there is at least a chance of a quick resolution. The Democrat Mark Kelly leads by six percentage points, 52 percent to 46 percent, with most of the Election Day and early votes counted. Most of the remaining vote is the mail ballots that were returned to the state near the election, including on Election Day, along with provisional ballots.\n\nThese days, mail and provisional ballots are typically good for Democrats. But this is not a normal case. A large majority of voters cast ballots by mail in Arizona, so the mail ballots are not nearly as favorable toward Democrats. Instead, a strange pattern has emerged in recent years: Democrats mail in their ballots well ahead of the election, leaving Republicans to turn in their ballots near the election or simply prefer to vote in person. In 2020, Donald J. Trump won the ballots counted after Election Day by a wide margin here, turning a four-point lead for Mr. Biden at this hour in 2020 into a race won by less than a point.\n\nThis time, the Republican Blake Masters will need to mount an even larger comeback at least as measured in percentage point margin. It may seem daunting, but it may not be quite as challenging as it looks: There might be about twice as many outstanding mail ballots, as a share of all voters, as there were at this time in 2020.\n\nMr. Kelly seemingly has a healthy lead from the early vote, but there is no hard evidence that a Masters victory is impossible. Well probably begin to get a sense of whether these mail ballots look like 2020s mail votes as soon as today.\n\nNYT\n\nCOLIN KAEPERNICK, Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award-winning American civil rights activist and football quarterback who is a free agent and, who played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League, celebrates his 35th Birthday today!\n\n\"VIOLENCE,\" \"DEMOCRACY ITSELF,\" AND FETTERMAN'S SHORTS: The Official 2022 Midterm Election Drinking Game\n\nThe hammer-to-cranium feel of congressional election propaganda will worsen exponentially Tuesday night. Your guide to drinking the pain away.\n\nby Matt Taibbi\n\nAmerica could be stumbling drunk pretty fast tonight just based on Rule #1 of the Official 2022 Midterm Election Drinking Game: drink at every mention of democracy itself. Weve been told for months thats whats at stake, and its a safe bet youll be told it again tonight at least enough times to drain a bottle or two.\n\nBut what fun would a drinking game with one rulebe? Especially at the end (we hope!) of a political season as infuriating as this one, we deserve to kick it a little. The quantity of terror-mongering this year has been unprecedented. Issues all but vanished. In their place the public was subjected to an endless parade of horror tales about democracys end, \"attacks\" on ballot integrity, intimidation, disenfranchisement, foreign influence, \"election denial,\" and three bears of the new Homeland Security Goldilocks tale: misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation.\n\nAll of which makes the prospect of watching returns tonight grimmer than usual, but were here to help, with drinking game rules for tonights broadcasts. Im going to be watching MSNBC, purely for comedy value, but you can substitute any broadcast from Fox to CNN fairly easily. Im on kid duty tonight and unfortunately wont be on hand for the whole night. However, I plan on trying Substacks new chat feature, opening a beer and a chat with subscribers at 8 p.m. Youll need the Substack App to take part. Ill also be joining Katie Halper on her show at around 10 p.m (click here to join).\n\nNo matter where you watch, coverage tonight should be packed with lunatic hyperbole, with warnings either about a blood-soaked New American Reich or a vast election-theft conspiracy, depending on which party succeeds. Of course the most likely end is the Beastie Boys No Sleep Till Brooklyn scenario, i.e. we dont make it to an answer no matter how late we stay up, with panic continuing for weeks and people on all sides feeling more anxious and hating one another more as time progresses.\n\nDrink EVERY TIME:\n\nAnyone, from a candidate to a TV anchor, mentions that \"democracy is on the ballot.\" Double-shot for use of the phrase democracy itself, e,g, \"democracy itself is on the ballot.\"\n\nYoure told this is the most important election of our lifetime, or the most critical moment of our lives, etc. You may drink an additional shot if youre certain today is not any of those things.\n\nSteve Kornacki draws a frenzied geometric shape around Pennsylvania.\n\nJohn Fettermans shorts are visible in a video report.\n\nNate Silver reminds you he doesnt do predictions, but rather publishes percentage-chance forecasts.\n\nLiz Cheney is mentioned (i.e. as if mattering).\n\nElon Musk is blamed for something. Double-shot if the bad thing is \"in the name of\" or \"under the guise of\" free speech.\n\nAnyone mentions \"over a hundred election deniers on the ballot.\" Also drink for permutations on the theme, e.g. \"60% of Americans will have an election-denier on the ballot,\" or \"Over half of GOP candidates are election-deniers,\" \"election-denier JD Vance wants to ban books,\" etc.\n\nAnyone mentions the \"specter of violence\" or \"conditions ripe for violence,\"or reports votes are being counted \"amid threats of violence.\" Do an exclamation shot at the end of the night if no violence is ultimately observed.\n\nA politician or a pundit warns that everything might come down to the \"wild card\" in Georgia, and with suspicious gleefulness reminds you we might all be waiting until December 6th to find out wholl control the Senate. Call it the \"No Sleep Till Georgia\" rule.\n\nSpecial MSNBC \"Decision 2022\" Election Night Rules:\n\nTune in at 8 p.m. Guess which of Rachel Maddow, Nicolle Wallace, Joy Reid, Chris Hayes, Alex Wagner, Lawrence ODonnell, Ari Melber, Stephanie Ruhle or the aforementioned Kornacki will be first to blame any Republican victory on disobedient or insufficiently centrist Democrats and/or third party \"spoilers.\" Drink the first time this happens anyway, and drink a double if you guess correctly.\n\nGuess which contributor will be the first to make a cringe sports-related joke about Herschel Walker. Drink the first time this happens, and drink a double if you guess correctly or the person botches the terminology (e.g. \"For once, Herschel Walker cant pile the move\").\n\nGuess which contributor will be first to convey warnings from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, US Capitol Police, or National Counterterrorism Center about threats, misinformation, or the impending end of civilization. Drink the first time this happens, and drink a double if you guess correctly or the contributor happens also to be a former government official.\n\nGuess which contributor will be the first to invoke Nazis, fascists, or white supremacy, or suggests without irony that tonight might be the last time we ever have elections. Drink the first time this happens, drink a double if you guess correctly.\n\nOPTIONAL: Keep a running count of how many times the word \"Trump\" is mentioned on the broadcast versus all mentions of all other issues (health care, education, the economy/inflation, etc.). If at the end of the night you have a \"hot deck,\" i.e. the number is +4 for Trump, you may drink that many times. If the deck is cold, drink coffee. Or whatever.\n\nDrink Only The First Time You Hear:\n\n\"Red wave.\"\n\n\"Red mirage.\"\n\nRussians/Putin want you to vote Republican (e.g. \"a Republican majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives could help the Russian war effort\").\n\nRemember, rules can be combined. Heres a double-shot, for instance:\n\nLiz Cheney: \"This is exactly what Putin wants. If wed had Republicans like this in the 1980s we would have lost the Cold War.\"\n\nAs always, do not politics and drive. Hydrate before sleeping, hug your loved ones, and dont wig out too much, no matter what the result. The sun will still come up tomorrow.\n\n\"Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.\"\n\nEdward Abbey\n\nA MAGA VICTORY WOULD BE DISASTROUS\n\nby Paul Krugman\n\nIf you arent feeling a sense of dread on the eve of the midterm elections, you havent been paying attention.\n\nWe can talk about the conventional stakes of these elections their implications for economic policy, major social programs, environmental policy, civil liberties and reproductive rights. And its not wrong to have these discussions: Life will go on whatever happens on the political scene, and government policies will continue to have a big impact on peoples lives.\n\nBut I, at least, always feel at least a bit guilty when writing about inflation or the fate of Medicare. Yes, these are my specialties. Focusing on them, however, feels a bit like denial, or at least evasion, when the fundamental stakes right now are so existential.\n\nTen or 20 years ago, those of us who warned that the Republican Party was becoming increasingly extremist and anti-democracy were often dismissed as alarmists. But the alarmists have been vindicated every step of the way, from the selling of the Iraq war on false pretenses to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nIndeed, these days its almost conventional wisdom that the G.O.P. will, if it can, turn America into something like Viktor Orbans Hungary: a democracy on paper, but an ethnonationalist, authoritarian one-party state in practice. After all, U.S. conservatives have made no secret about viewing Hungary as a role model; they have feted Orban and featured him at their conferences.\n\nAt this point, however, I believe that even this conventional wisdom is wrong. If America descends into one-party rule, it will be much worse, much uglier, than what we see in todays Hungary.\n\nBefore I get there, a word about the role of conventional policy issues in these elections.\n\nIf Democrats lose one or both houses of Congress, there will be a loud chorus of recriminations, much of it asserting that they should have focused on kitchen table issues and not talked at all about threats to democracy.\n\nI dont claim any expertise here, but I would note that an incumbent presidents party almost always loses seats in the midterms. The only exception to that rule this century was in 2002, when George W. Bush was able to deflect attention from a jobless recovery by posing as Americas defender against terrorism. That record suggests, if anything, that Democrats should have talked even more about issues beyond economics.\n\nId also say that pretending that this was an ordinary election season, where only economic policy was at stake, would have been fundamentally dishonest.\n\nFinally, even voters who are more worried about paychecks and living costs than about democracy should nonetheless be very concerned about the G.O.P.s rejection of democratic norms.\n\nFor one thing, Republicans have been open about their plan to use the threat of economic chaos to extract concessions they couldnt win through the normal legislative process.\n\nAlso, while I understand the instinct of voters to choose a different driver if they dont like where the economy is going, they should understand that this time, voting Republican doesnt just mean giving someone else a chance at the wheel; it may be a big step toward handing the G.O.P. permanent control, with no chance for voters to revisit that decision if they dont like the results.\n\nWhich brings me to the question of what a one-party America would look like.\n\nAs I said, its now almost conventional wisdom that Republicans are trying to turn us into Hungary. Indeed, Hungary provides a case study in how democracies can die in the 21st century.\n\nBut what strikes me, reading about Orbans rule, is that while his regime is deeply repressive, the repression is relatively subtle. It is, as one perceptive article put it, \"soft fascism,\" which makes dissidents powerless via its control of the economy and the news media without beating them up or putting them in jail.\n\nDo you think a MAGA regime, with or without Donald Trump, would be equally subtle? Listen to the speeches at any Trump rally. Theyre full of vindictiveness, of promises to imprison and punish anyone including technocrats like Anthony Fauci the movement dislikes.\n\nAnd much of the American right is sympathetic to, or at least unwilling to condemn, violence against its opponents. The Republican reaction to the attack on Paul Pelosi by a MAGA-spouting intruder was telling: Many in the party didnt even pretend to be horrified. Instead, they peddled ugly conspiracy theories. And the rest of the party didnt ostracize or penalize the purveyors of vile falsehoods.\n\nIn short, if MAGA wins, well probably find ourselves wishing its rule was as tolerant, relatively benign and relatively nonviolent as Orbans.\n\nNow, this catastrophe doesnt have to happen. Even if Republicans win big in the midterms, it wont be the end for democracy, although it will be a big blow. And nothing in politics, not even a full descent into authoritarianism, is permanent.\n\nOn the other hand, even if we get a reprieve this week, the fact remains that democracy is in deep danger from the authoritarian right. America as we know it is not yet lost, but its on the edge.\n\nEXAMINING US: The Voters & Drop-Out Voters\n\nby Ralph Nader\n\nVoter grumbling, rage and cynicism is rampant heading into the mid-term elections on November 8th. Add the flattering, flummoxing and fooling of voters by many corporatist politicians to the mix and we have the makings of an election-day disaster.\n\nSet the above aside and reflect on the unused citizen power, given wholesale, to 535 members of Congress. Our sovereign power starts with the preamble to our U.S. Constitution that is \"We the People.\" Not \"We the Congress.\" Not \"We the Corporations.\" As a Republic, we then delegate power to Congress to define, enable and fund the activities of the Executive and Judicial branches.\n\nIf you dont like what your Senators and Representatives are doing, elections are supposed to give you a chance to say \"Stop, Go, Listen or Leave.\" The problem is that the monied interests corrupt our elections, from pressing their own choice of candidates, financing them, directing them and backing them with nonstop television/radio/social media propaganda, and using front groups to promote lies and coverups.\n\nYear after year, this assault has ground most voters into Republicans and Democrats under varying degrees of corporate encampments. Too many voters put these labels on themselves and never look back.\n\nHeres the nub. Most voters who do not do their homework about \"politics\" \"elections\" and their \"voting strategies\" end up either passively voting for their familys long-held party choice or staying home. Not voting helps powerful interests have a field day because voters are not even on the playing field. There are an estimated 120 million eligible voters who will not vote in this election.\n\nVoters who dont spend the time dont realize that candidates go back to Washington and work actively and often furtively against peoples most immediate livelihood interests, as does Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. Such lawmakers aid and abet your worst fears about \"politics\" unless youre quite rich.\n\nFor example, when you delegate (with no accountability attached) your voting power to Congress, you are entrenching corporate power to keep your wages down, allow price gouging and crumble your public services in favor of more destructive weapons for an Empire and needless wars we dont want. The corporate Congress renders our country unprepared for pandemics, climate violence and the corporate crime wave running amuck. Moreover, Congress sends your tax revenues as subsidies and bailouts to the grossly under-taxed super-rich and big businesses.\n\nWhenever you hear your friends say \"Im not into politics theyre all crooks\" signifying dropping out of voting and civic engagement, you can tell them, \"But politics is into you in all kinds of impactful ways. Since you cant escape, quitting is only hurting you.\"\n\nTo be sure, our two-party duopoly restricts choices and opens the door wide to con artists candidates with bulging campaign treasures. They specialize in grand lies, fake versions of what they call reality (as with \"Covid-19 is fake\" and \"global warming is a hoax\"). They make grandiose promises, then betray you and always blame someone else. Voters who dont do their homework become rigid believers and do not reconsider what political tricksters have done to them.\n\nFor example, did you know that the greatest wealth in our country is owned by the people, but controlled by corporate power? These powerful assets of the people include our vast public lands, public airwaves and government R & D that founded most of the modern industry (e.g., the internet, computers, aerospace, drug, biotech and nanotech industries) and trillions of dollars in money market savings and pensions. Who allowed corporations to control what you own and turn these assets against your legitimate interests? The politicians. Do you still want to drop out of politics?\n\nIn your own private moments, ask yourself whether you are spending as much time studying the candidates vying for your vote as you do when choosing to buy a car or a house, or playing a months worth of bridge or video games.\n\nVoter withdrawal is allowing the dangerous extremists in the GOP to think the unthinkable taking away what you already have by corporatizing Medicare, cutting Social Security and repealing consumer, labor and environmental protections. Theyre saying things that fifty years ago would have been political suicide for their notorious careers. Such cruel assaults on the peoples well-being reflect their sense of what the passive voters will let unscrupulous candidates get away with.\n\nIf you want recent evidence, read the report by GOP Senate Re-election Chairman, Rick Scott (R-FL) who once presided over a large hospital corporation fined $1.7 billion for defrauding Medicare. The reports misleading title \"An 11 Point Plan to Rescue America\" demands that your existing protections and economic security be terminated and up for Congressional grabs every few years.\n\nOther GOPers want to eliminate the minimum wage altogether never mind just holding it at its present frozen federal level of $7.25 an hour.\n\nWith voters reading, thinking and acting, our country can turn around and benefit all the people, their children and grandchildren. Its in your hands, people. Pursue your legitimate interests and you will find Thomas Jeffersons \"pursuit of happiness\" goal on its way as never before.\n\nIf youre waiting until election day to vote, take a look at the website winningamerica.net and my little paperback Breaking Through Power: Its Easier Than We Think.\n\nThen do your duty and cast an informed vote!\n\nWorkers of the World, Unite!, 1900\n\nTHE NBAS HYPOCRISIES ARE SABOTAGING ITS RESPONSE TO KYRIE IRVING\n\nby Dave Zirin\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have decided that Kyrie Irving is \"not fit to associate\" with their team for five games because he posted an anti-Semitic video called Hebrews to Negroes. Following Irvings apology on Instagramafter not apologizing to the media twicethe team laid out a set of conditions for him to return that seem designed to ensure that if he refuses, it could mean the end of his career. I wrote about the politics of the filmand more importantly the white supremacist forces celebrating Kyrielast week. But suffice it to say, seeing the film, which denies the Holocaust and claims Jews worship Satan, atop Amazons charts has Nazi message boards in a tizzy of joy. Its like a giggling popularity contest between boosters of Elon, Tucker, Kanye, and Kyrie.\n\nWhether Kyrie believes the mythologies presented in Hebrews to Negroes is one issue. But his inability to disavow his fascist cheering section is distressing. Even more disturbing is that neither the Nets nor the NBA have pressed him on this point. Their silence on the broader political implications of the films new popularity has created a dynamic: The Nets and the league seem primarily concerned with the hurt feelings of their Jewish fan base, not addressing the political climate of white supremacist rage, which is precisely what makes the films ideas so dangerous.\n\nThey will not address the climate, because then they would have to address their own complicity in its creation. They would have to address why they are fine with the DeVos family, which owns the Orlando Magic, bankrolling groups on the Christian Right, including the work of fascistic Blackwater founder Erik Prince whose sister, Betsy DeVos, was the education secretary under Trump. They would have to address why 81 percent of political money spent by franchise owners flowed to the GOP in 2020, with several sending small fortunes to the election denier, coup plotter, and bigot-in-chief Donald Trump. The orange fascist has done more to whip up hatred against oppressed groups, including American-born Jews, than Kyrie could in a 1,000 lifetimes. Yet the league will provide home for a right-wing union busting billionaire like the Trump-loving Tilman Fertitta of the Houston Rockets.\n\nThen there is the Nets billionaire owner Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the company Alibaba, which, according to an ESPN report, financially supported the \"cultural genocide\" of Uyghur Muslims. Tsai insisted on meeting with Irving to \"educate\" him about the perils of anti-Semitism. (For some reason Tsai is \"fit to associate\" with the Brooklyn Nets.) Then there is the Anti-Defamation League, which returned a $500,000 donation from Irving and is one of the arbiters of Kyries repentance. The ADL, which is presented in the press as if its the Jewish version of the NAACP, is an organization with its own history attacks against Black leaders and virulent anti-Palestinian bigotry. (I strongly encourage people to read this piece in the Boston Review by Emmaia Gelman about the history of the ADL.) None of this is to give Kyrie a pass. I dont believe in \"whataboutism,\" where the sins of one are absolved by the sins of their enemies. But it is to point out that those standing in judgment of him are some of the worst actors in our politics. This is why I oppose the fines and suspensions against Kyrie. All they do is turn him into a martyr and make the film that much more attractive to the fascist curious. Adam Silver and the league have also now drawn a line that means NBA athletes, who have been encouraged over the last decade to speak their minds, must now watch what they say or face consequences for what they post. Many people are reading it to mean there is free speech for Black athletesbut only as long as people in power can abide the beliefs being expressed. This is causing fans, tragically in my view, to equate Kyrie with the great athlete-activists of decades past. He hasnt shown that courage or earned that distinction. But the more he is punished, the more people will think that shoe fits. Again, thats a tragedy, but it would be one of the NBAs making.\n\nThen what do you do? The only way to fight anti-Semitism is by linking it to broader fights against racism and oppression. (And solidarity to my Black Jewish friends who find themselves straddling these identities in highly divisive times.) This wont happen by making Kyrie a martyr.\n\nThe only way we can make these links is to both condemn this video while also condemning the anti-Black racism of the response, not to mention the anti-Black racism that constantly goes ignored. When Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan expressed joy that Kyrie was \"put in his place,\" that is anti-Black racism, and it should be condemned.\n\nKanye West clearly has no interestfinancial or politicalin a mass movement against all forms of oppression. Floyd Mayweather, another Kyrie supporter, is a serial abuser of women, not a fighter for anyones liberation. Our ability to come together will mean saying we are against anti-Semitism and all forms of racism; that if we condemn Kyries actions, we also condemn the actions of the hypocrites swirling around him. This might sound pie in the skydont suspend Kyrie, but build a movement to confront all racist and bigoted ideasbut its the best choice among the awful alternatives, and the only one that provides hope that we can emerge from this darkness.\n\nNixon's Last Presidential Lunch\n\nUKRAINE, TUESDAY, 8TH NOVEMBER\n\nSenior US officials have been urging Ukraine in recent weeks to signal it is open to diplomatic discussions with Russia, sources told CNN. When asked about the reports in an interview with CNN in Kyiv, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that any negotiations must have \"Ukraine in the driver's seat.\"\n\nRussian forces have stepped up their scrutiny of civilians in occupied areas of Ukraine's southern Kherson region, detaining locals to root out partisan resistance, according to the Ukrainian military. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said Tuesday it had disrupted a \"sabotage and reconnaissance group\" in Kherson, and detained nine Ukrainians.\n\nRussian soldiers have complained about being sent into an \"incomprehensible battle\" in the Donetsk region. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow had suffered heavy losses in the eastern region.\n\nKyiv is preparing for worst-case scenarios in the event of further Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure that could potentially leave the capital without electricity or water, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.\n\nRichard Nixon boarding Army One upon his departure from the White House after resigning the office of President of the United States following the Watergate Scandal (August 9, 1974).\n\nON LINE COMMENT OF THE DAY\n\nThere is no way to continue our current overconsumption so it will stop, and all the foot stomping and breath holding demands for it to continue will not produce more oil, topsoil or water.\n\nThe last 80 years were an incredible assault on the ecosystem that sustains all life on the planet, and it really ramped up after 1980.\n\nTaking chemical weapons designed to kill people and using them after the war on food in order to destroy insects seemed like a good idea at the time, I guess, but it hasnt really worked out well, although it ballooned the human population to obscene levels.\n\nUsing fossil fuels to raze forests, vacuum oceans and strip mine topsoil was also a bad idea.\n\nI dont think it can be fixed, but even if it could, there is no will to do so.\n\nBILL BRYSON: BY THE BOOK\n\nWhat books are currently on your night stand?\n\nI have so many books stacked beside my bed that I cant be absolutely sure that there is actually a night stand in there. Those at the very top of the pile are: \"The History of Modern France,\" by Jonathan Fenby; \"Lifes Greatest Secret: The Race to Crack the Genetic Code,\" by Matthew Cobb; \"The Planet Remade: How Geoengineering Could Change the World,\" by Oliver Morton; and the one I am most actively immersed in at present, a funny, moving, very entertaining memoir called \"Flesh Wounds,\" by the Australian writer Richard Glover.\n\nWhats the last great book you read?\n\nWhile doing a short biography of William Shakespeare a few years ago, I read all his plays over the course of one summer. (Actually, if I am honest, I didnt read \"Timon of Athens.\" I dont think anyone ever has.) That was the last really ambitious reading I can recall.\n\nWho are your favorite travel writers, and what is your favorite travel book?\n\nFor their descriptive powers and command of material, I admire Paul Theroux, Jonathan Raban, Sara Wheeler and Colin Thubron, but for pure pleasure I dont think you can beat the travel books of S. J. Perelman, though they are not so easy to find now. My favorite travel book of all is \"In Trouble Again,\" by the British writer Redmond OHanlon. It concerns a trek into a dangerous corner of Amazonia. It is sidesplittingly funny to begin with, but then grows increasingly dark and scary in a way that is both unsettling and unforgettable.\n\nWhich genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\n\nWhen I can read what I want, I generally go for histories and historical biographies, though much of my reading is naturally dictated by research requirements. For escapist reading, I especially like the sea novels of Patrick OBrian. I dont consciously avoid any genres, but it is unlikely you would find me lingering in the section where they keep books like \"Eat, Pray, Love\" or memoirs of life with a pet.\n\nWhat is the last book that made you cry?\n\nI was one of the judges for last years Wellcome medical book prize, and the winning book, \"The Iceberg,\" by Marion Coutts, was the most moving book I have read in some time. It is her account of the decline and death of her husband from a brain tumor. It is a harrowing read, as you would expect, but also beautifully written and intensely powerful.\n\nWhat was the last book that made you furious?\n\n\"The Ocean of Life,\" by Callum Roberts, a marine biologist at the University of York in England. It is a very sober, nonpolemic look at how we are ruining the Earths oceans through overfishing and poor management. If nothing else, it will make you think twice before ordering mahi-mahi again.\n\nTell us about your favorite poem.\n\nI am not a good reader of poetry, but recently I happened upon \"In Flanders Fields,\" the celebrated poem of the First World War. I had never read it all the way through and was astounded by how powerful and moving a few simple lines could be. I had always assumed that the author was British, but in fact he was a Canadian doctor named John McCrae, who wrote it just after the Second Battle of Ypres. McCrae died a short while later himself without ever seeing home again, which clearly adds to the poignancy of it.\n\nAnd your favorite movie adaptation of a book.\n\nIf by that you mean which movie is much better than the book (or books) on which it was based, I would instantly say \"The Wizard of Oz.\" If you mean which is most enjoyably faithful to the original, I would propose \"The English Patient.\"\n\nWho is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?\n\nWhen I was young I had a period of reading J. D. Salingers books and wanting intensely to be a member of the Glass family, partly because they lived in a big apartment in Manhattan, which seemed terribly exciting to me as a boy from Iowa, and partly because their conversations struck me as so much more scintillating and profound than those we had in our house. I dont think I especially identified with any of the characters, but just wanted to be taken into the family. I havent read Salingers books since I was about 15, and I am pretty nearly certain I would find all the characters shallow and insufferable now, which is why I havent read them again. The only villain that springs to mind for me is Captain Hook in the Disney cartoons of my childhood. He scared the daylights out of me. But I cant think of a good literary choice offhand.\n\nWhich childhood books and authors stick with you most?\n\nI was completely devoted to an imprint called Landmark Books when I was growing up. I dont know whether anyone remembers this series anymore, but they were nonfiction hardback books, on historical subjects, written for children or adapted from adult books. They made you feel that you were taking part in a grown-up activity but at a level that you could handle. A good deal of what I know about American history came from Landmark Books. I used to spend nearly all my pocket money on either Landmark Books or, if I was feeling rakish, Hardy Boys books. I am hugely indebted to both.\n\nIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?\n\nGoodness, thats a big question. I remember in early adolescence reading \"The Sot-Weed Factor,\" by John Barth, and being so enchanted with it that I wanted to become a writer, too. At about the same time I had a similar experience with \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" I have never written anything like either of those books never attempted fiction at all but there was something about the magic and possibility of the written word that captured me.\n\nWhat author, living or dead, would you most like to meet?\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, as long as I didnt have to tell him that when wed finished talking hed have to go back to being dead again.\n\nWhat was the last book you put down without finishing?\n\nNearly ever summer when we go away on vacation I pack an old copy of \"Anna Karenina,\" and every year I manage to move the bookmark about 20 pages along before it is time to go home. I have long since lost track of who most of the characters are or what their relationships are with one another. I cant pretend that any of them have ever interested me. At the rate I am going, I estimate that I will need approximately 74 more vacations to finish the book.\n\nOf the books youve written, which is your favorite?\n\nI suppose that would have to be \"A Walk in the Woods,\" my account of a profoundly hopeless attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail in the company of an equally hopeless companion named (pseudonymously) Stephen Katz. The Appalachian Trail is physically very grueling, but it is also awfully hard to write about. Walking, even when it is going well, is an intensely repetitive experience. The whole time we were out there, I kept thinking: \"All we are doing is walking every day. I dont know how I am ever going to get a book out of this.\" So the fact that it did eventually result in a book is to me a kind of permanent miracle.\n\nWhom would you want to write your life story?\n\nMy wife. She is kind, and she was there.\n\n(New York Times)",

Ukrainian victory in Kherson, one of the main objectives of Kyivs southern offensive, will be widely seen as a significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the \"forever\" annexation of Kherson region along with three other regions.\n\n10 Nov 2022 19.08 EST Summary Thats it for todays live blog. Thank you for following our coverage. Heres a a round-up of todays top headlines and latest developments: Russias defence minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered Russian troops to withdraw from Ukraines city of Kherson, the only regional capital captured by Moscow since this years invasion. Russia did not formally declare its retreat, but in a televised meeting with Shoigu, General Sergei Surovikin said it was no longer possible to keep supplying Kherson. This represents a setback for Russian president Vladimir Putin, who just weeks before had announced the \"forever\" annexation of the Kherson region.\n\nKirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-appointed administration in the Kherson region, was killed in a car crash. Once an anti-vaccine blogger, Stremousov rose to notoriety as one of the most prominent public faces of the Russian occupation of Ukraine, frequently posting aggressive anti-Ukrainian videos to social media. Russian president Vladimir Putin posthumously decorated Stremousov with the Order of Courage, a top state award.\n\nRussian forces destroyed bridges on the west bank of the Dnipro River in Ukraines southern Kherson region to slow a continuing Ukrainian advance. Ukrainian forces were reported to have retaken a number of settlements, amid what Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskiy described as \"intense fighting\" on the southern frontline.\n\nUS president Joe Biden said Russias withdrawal of troops from Kherson is \"evidence\" that the Russian military has \"real problems.\" During a White House press conference, Biden said: \"It remains to be seen whether or not there will be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia.\" As midterm election votes are still being counted, Biden also told reporters he expects US aid to Ukraine will carry on.\n\nNato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it was \"encouraging\" to see Ukrainian forces liberating more of the countrys territory. On his visit to London to meet with prime minister Rishi Sunak, Stoltenberg said Russias retreat from Kherson is \"part of an overall pattern\" demonstrating that Moscow \"has absolutely lost the momentum.\"\n\nUN aid chief Martin Griffiths and senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan will meet with Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin on Friday to discuss extending the Black Sea grain initiative. \"They will continue ongoing consultations in support of the efforts by the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the full implementation of the two agreements signed on 22 July in Istanbul,\" a UN spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow had contacts with US officials from time to time. Zakharova confirmed there would soon be US-Russia consultations on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control agreement between the worlds two largest nuclear powers.\n\nA British man has died fighting in Ukraine, his family and the Foreign Office said. Simon Lingard, a father of two from Blackburn, Lancashire, died on Monday. \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has lost his life in Ukraine and we are in touch with the local authorities in connection with his death,\" a Foreign Office spokesperson said.\n\n9 Nov 2022 18.03 EST Biden expects US aid to Ukraine will continue US president Joe Biden said on Wednesday that he expects American aid to Ukraine to continue uninterrupted, as the divisive midterm elections saw Republican pushback on the issue. Last month, Kevin McCarthy the Republican minority leader in the US House of Representatives said his party will not write a \"blank check\" for Ukraine if the GOP wins the House majority. Speaking to reporters from the White House, Biden was asked whether aid to Ukraine will continue uninterrupted, to which he responded: \"That is my expectation.\" \"And by the way, weve not given Ukraine a blank check,\" the president said. \"Theres a lot of things that Ukraine wants that we didnt do.\" \"For example, I was asked very much whether wed provide American aircrafts to guarantee the skies over Ukraine,\" he continued. \"I said No, were not gonna do that, were no gonna get into a third world war taking on Russian aircrafts and directly engage, but would we provide them with all the rational ability to defend themselves? Yes.\" Biden said he wants to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself and \"take on what is purely the ugliest aggression thats occurred since World War 2 on a massive scale\". \"So I would be surprised if leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say theyre not gonna fund the legitimate defence and needs of Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nUpdated at 18.05 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 17.23 EST Biden says Kherson retreat shows Russia's military has 'real problems' US president Joe Biden said Wednesday that Russias withdrawal of troops from Kherson is \"evidence\" that its military has \"real problems\". During a White House press conference as midterm election votes are still being counted, Biden addressed Moscows decision to remove its forces from the key Ukrainian city of Kherson. \"First of all, I found it interesting that they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time that they were going to be doing,\" Biden said. \"And its evidence of the fact that they have some real problems, the Russian military.\" \"It remains to be seen whether or not there will be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia,\" he added. Biden who will be attending the upcoming G20 summit in Indonesia said he and other world leaders will \"have an opportunity to see what the next steps may be\" regarding the conflict.\n\n9 Nov 2022 16.55 EST US president Joe Biden on Wednesday expressed hope for Democrats and Republicans to continue their \"bipartisan approach\" to Russias war in Ukraine, regardless of the final results of the midterm elections. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said: \"Regardless of what the final tally of these elections show, and theres still some counting going on, Im prepared to work with my Republican colleagues. The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans be prepared to work with me as well. In the area of foreign policy, I hope well continue this bipartisan approach of confronting Russias aggression in Ukraine.

Simon Lingard died on Monday, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family for funeral expenses. The father of two from Blackburn, Lancashire, was described as \"an inspiration to all who knew him\" and \"a real life hero who died fighting for what he believed in\". \"He was loved and adored by so many a true representation of what a soldier should be,\" the fundraisers description reads. A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed Lingards death in a statement to AFP. \"We are supporting the family of a British national who has lost his life in Ukraine and we are in touch with the local authorities in connection with his death,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUpdated at 15.50 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 15.27 EST Russian president Vladimir Putin posthumously decorated Kirill Stremousov with the Order of Courage, a top state award, the Kremlin said on Wednesday. Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-appointed administration in the Kherson region, was killed in a car crash earlier today. A decree from Putins office said Stremousov was awarded for \"courage and valour shown in the line of duty\". Formerly an anti-vaccine blogger, Stremousov rose to notoriety as one of the most prominent faces of Russias occupation of Ukraine. A setback for Moscow, Stremousovs death came as Ukrainian forces launched an offensive to gain a foothold in the key city of Kherson. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu later ordered troops to withdraw from the city.\n\nUpdated at 15.48 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 14.40 EST UN aid chief Martin Griffiths and senior UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan will meet with Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin on Friday to discuss extending the Black Sea grain initiative, Reuters reports. Griffiths leads talks on Ukrainian exports, while Grynspan heads discussions on Russian food and fertiliser exports. \"It is hoped that the discussions will advance progress made in facilitating the unimpeded export of food and fertilisers originating from the Russian Federation to the global markets,\" a UN spokesperson said on Wednesday.\n\n9 Nov 2022 14.24 EST Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday said Russias apparent retreat from Kherson is \"part of an overall pattern\" demonstrating that Moscow \"has absolutely lost the momentum.\" On his visit to London to meet with prime minister Rishi Sunak, Stoltenberg was asked about the Kherson retreat in an interview with Sky News. \"Its part of an overall pattern or picture we have seen over the last month that Russia has absolutely lost the momentum,\" Stoltenberg said. \"But we should not underestimate Russia, they still have capabilities,\" he added. \"We have seen the drones, we have seen the missile attacks. It shows that Russia can still inflict a lot of damage.\"\n\nUpdated at 14.29 EST\n\n9 Nov 2022 13.58 EST Summary The time in Kyiv is almost 9pm. Here is a round-up of the days main headlines: Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has ordered the countrys troops to leave Ukraines city of Kherson, the only regional capital Moscow captured since the invasion began in February. Ukrainian victory in Kherson, one of the main objectives of Kyivs southern offensive, will be widely seen as a significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the \"forever\" annexation of Kherson region along with three other regions.\n\nWhile Russia did not formally declare that it was abandoning the key city of Kherson, all signs point to a Moscow retreat from the only regional capital it captured after invading in February. In a televised meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Gen Sergei Surovikin said it was no longer possible to keep supplying Kherson.\n\nRussian forces have destroyed bridges on the west bank of the Dnipro River in Ukraines southern Kherson region to slow a continuing Ukrainian advance, as it was reported that one of the most prominent Russian-installed officials had been killed in a car crash. As the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, described \"intense fighting\" on the southern frontline, Ukrainian troops were reported to have retaken a number of settlements.\n\nKirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the Kherson region, has died in a car crash, state news agencies have reported, citing local Russian-backed officials. Stremousov, previously an anti-vaccine blogger and political marginal, had emerged as one of the most prominent public faces of the Russian occupation of Ukraine, frequently using social media to record aggressive anti-Ukrainian videos. Stremousovs death comes as Ukraine appears to have launched a new offensive to recapture the key city of Kherson.\n\nSenior United Nations officials planned to meet members of a high-level Russian delegation in Geneva on Friday to discuss the Ukraine grain deal, a UN spokesperson said. \"They will continue ongoing consultations in support of the efforts by the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the full implementation of the two agreements signed on 22 July in Istanbul,\" the spokesperson said in a statement today.\n\nJens Stoltenberg said Vladimir Putin made \"several huge mistakes\" when he invaded, including underestimating Natos ability to support Ukraine. \"President Putin made several huge mistakes when he invaded Ukraine, strategic mistakes,\" the Nato chief told media outside No 10 Downing Street on a visit to the UK.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update, saying: \"Russian efforts to repair the Crimean bridge continue but it is unlikely to be fully operational until at least September 2023.\" According to intelligence, the road bridge was closed yesterday to allow the movement and installation of a replacement 64-metre space. Three more spans will be required to replace the damaged sections. \"Although Crimean officials have claimed these additional spans will be in place by 20 December, a briefing provided to President Putin added that works to the other carriageway would cause disruption to road traffic until March 2023.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova , said Moscow had contacts with US officials from time to time, and confirmed there would soon be US-Russia consultations on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty, the last remaining arms control agreement between the worlds two largest nuclear powers.\n\nUkraine has collated thousands of reports of its children being deported to Russia and wants their plight addressed at a summit of the Group of 20 major economies, Vladimir Zelenskiys chief of staff was quoted as saying on Tuesday. \"The Russian Federation continues to commit its crimes in connection with Ukrainian children,\" Zelenskiys office quoted Andriy Yermak as saying at a meeting he chaired of a group of officials responsible for child protection. \"The removal of children continues.\"\n\nThousands of Kyiv residents have signed a petition urging city authorities not to erect a giant tree during this years festive period, and instead to give money to the army and to people displaced by the war with Russia. The Kyiv tree, which in recent years has been set up in front of the 11th-century Saint Sophia Cathedral at the heart of the capital, is traditionally the main one in Ukraine at Christmas and New Year.\n\nRussia has been an \"active adversary\" of the UK for a number of years, the British defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace visited the Lydd army camp in Kent, where Ukrainian volunteers are being trained to fight in the war against Russia. The cabinet minister referred to the Salisbury novichok poisonings in 2016 and said the UK did not fear reprisals from Russia for supporting Ukraine.\n\nVillages and towns in Ukraine have experienced more heavy fighting and shelling as Ukrainian and Russian forces strained to advance on different fronts after more than eight and a half months of war. At least nine civilians were killed and 24 others were wounded in 24 hours, the Ukrainian Presidents office said, as it accused Russia of using explosive drones, rockets, heavy artillery and aircraft to attack eight regions in the countrys south-east.\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces also clashed overnight over Snihurivka , a town about 30 miles north of the southern city of Kherson, the Associated Press reported. Ukraines army hopes to reclaim the Russian-occupied city, the only regional capital captured during Moscows February invasion and a key target of an ongoing counter-offensive.\n\nThe US basketball player Brittney Griner is being transferred to a Russian penal colony but neither her family nor legal team have any details on where she is or where she is going. Thats it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Danya Hajjaji will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russias invasion of Ukraine.\n\n9 Nov 2022 13.27 EST Senior United Nations officials planned to meet members of a high-level Russian delegation in Geneva on Friday to discuss the Ukraine grain deal, a UN spokesperson said. \"They will continue ongoing consultations in support of the efforts by the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the full implementation of the two agreements signed on 22 July in Istanbul,\" the spokesperson said in a statement today.\n\n9 Nov 2022 12.56 EST Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday it was \"encouraging\" to see Ukrainian forces being able to liberate more of the countrys territory, after Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu ordered his troops to withdraw from Kherson. Speaking in London where he was meeting British prime minister Rishi Sunak, Stoltenberg said: The victories, the gains the Ukrainian armed forces are making belongs to the brave, courageous Ukrainian soldiers but of course the support they receive from the United Kingdom, from Nato allies and partners is also essential.",

                "cc_text": "The Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine has become the focus of intense speculation as Kyivs forces have pushed forward with a counteroffensive in the Kherson region in recent weeks. And this speculation has only intensified since Russia announced Wednesday that it would withdraw its forces from the right bank of the Dnipro River, abandoning the city of Kherson. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of attacking the dam, with Russias military commander in Ukraine, Sergei Surovikin, alleging last month that Kyiv was preparing a \"massive missile strike.\" Ukrainian officials have rejected claims they would deliberately target civilian infrastructure. And President Volodomyr Zelensky has warned Russian forces could blow up the dam and its hydroelectric facility themselves in what he said would be a \"terrorist\" attack. The finger-pointing from both sides has sparked fears that the dam could be deliberately destroyed an event that experts say would likely inflict mass destruction and spark a humanitarian crisis across a swathe of southern Ukraine. Why is the Kakhovka dam significant? Built in 1956, Kakhovka is the southernmost of six hydroelectric plants constructed along the Dnipro River during the Soviet period. Further downriver from Kakhovka is a deep-water channel extending to the Black Sea. Standing about 30 meters tall and over 3.2 kilometers wide, the dam stores roughly the same amount of water as the Great Salt Lake in the U.S. state of Utah.\n\nA Russian missile launcher pictured near the Kakhovka power station in March, 2022. Russian Defense Ministry\n\nOne of just three major crossings along the Dnipro in Kherson region, the dam has been a critical supply line for Russian forces fighting on the rivers right bank since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February. What is happening there? Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted the road and rail bridge over the dam which the Russian military relies on to deliver supplies to units in the occupied city of Kherson. If Russia does in fact withdraw all its troops to the left bank of the Dnipro River, the dam and the bridge could become part of the frontline between the two armies. Satellite images published in August showed several craters in the road bridge, which apparently forced Russian troops to construct a number of pontoon crossings nearby. Russian state media reported Sunday that the dam had been damaged in a Ukrainian strike using U.S.-supplied HIMARS missiles, but the claim could not be independently verified. While the Russian withdrawal from Kherson region does not necessarily make the blowing of the dam more likely, there are precedents for retreating armies destroying infrastructure. . \"There are lots of examples throughout history of retreating forces blowing up dams in an effort to delay their opponents, including Soviet efforts to slow the German advance through Ukraine in 1941,\" said James Black, a defense analyst at RAND Europe, part of the non-profit U.S. RAND Corporation. Is Russia preparing to destroy the dam? The order given by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for Russian forces to withdraw from the right bank of the Dnipro in Kherson region had long been anticipated by military analysts, who predicted that the Russian position would become untenable amid consistent military pressure from Ukraine. And, as the Ukrainian army has slowly advanced toward the river, officials in Kyiv have stepped up their warnings of a potential Russian false-flag operation to destroy the dam. According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia first mined the dam back in April and added more explosives to the floodgates and supporting structures last month. Destroying the dam and its hydroelectric station, which provides electricity to tens of thousands of Ukainians, would align with Russia's efforts to knock out critical Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent weeks. And some suggest it could be seen in Moscow as a move that would fortify its positions in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe Kakhovka dam and hyydroelectric power plant. Volodymyr Dziubak (CC BY-SA 4.0)",

                "cc_text": "Russia has said that retreat from the key city of Kherson has begun, but Ukraine remains cautious. The withdrawal from the city of Kherson is Russia's \"biggest setback of the war\" it is the only regional capital Russian forces had seized during the eight-month war. \"This has got to be bad for morale,\" Professor Michael Clarke, a former director of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the defence and security think tank, told Forces News.\n\n\"Kherson is the only significant city the Russians took in February. The Kremlin can dress this up in whatever way they want. \"The soldiers themselves know that they were occupying a city, they weren't popular in the city, and there were a lot of civilian attacks on them, which became quite vicious and difficult. \"And now they're withdrawing. The Russian military is already, if you look at Telegram channels in the first 48 hours after this announcement was made, alive with the Russian military feeling disgruntled by this setback. \"Which is the biggest setback of the war from their point of view.\" John Spencer, a retired US Army Major and urban warfare expert, said on Twitter: \"A great day for Ukraine. Kherson city is being liberated. The only regional capital Russia was able to seize the entire war. A major loss for Russia.\"\n\nA great day for Ukraine. Kherson city is being liberated. The only regional capital Russia was able to seize the entire war. A major loss for Russia. https://t.co/LPzBz4H58G John Spencer (@SpencerGuard) November 9, 2022\n\nThe city, with a pre-war population of 280,000, is the only regional capital to be captured by Russian forces since the invasion began on 24 February. More than 70,000 residents were evacuated in late October. Prof Clarke believes the Russians \"will want this to be a properly organised withdrawal\". \"They've got a lot of troops, maybe 40,000 troops to get out. It won't be a rout. They will want it to be a withdrawal in good order. And they've already laid a lot of the foundations for that and it has already been occurring.\" He went on: \"But they will be very lucky if they get all 40,000 troops onto the east bank of the Dnipro river without taking some losses. \"Because the Ukrainians, for sure, have the means to attack them as they withdraw. Withdrawal in contact... is the most difficult and dangerous military manoeuvre in the book.\"\n\nWatch: Russia \"yet again\" fails at one of its main objectives, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says. The former RUSI director did highlight that it was \"possible\" that the Russian withdrawal was all part of a ruse to \"bring the Ukrainians into a killing zone\". However, he doesn't think that would work. \"The Ukrainians are already thinking about that,\" he said. \"They are not so foolish as to go rushing in. I think what the Ukrainians will do is they will probe fairly gently, or carefully, towards Kherson city. \"The big issue is not really what happens in the city. I think the Ukrainians will stay out of the city for a while. The big issue is what happens further north.\" He added: \"I think this battle will turn, not so much on what happens in Kherson over the next week, but what happens in Nova Kakhovka in the next two weeks.\"\n\nRelated topics Ukraine\n\nRussia\n\nNews\n\nJoin Our Newsletter",

                "cc_text": "Russia announced Wednesday that it was withdrawing forces from Kherson, a key city in southern Ukraine, in what could turn out to be the most humiliating setback in President Vladimir Putins war.\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in televised comments he was ordering the withdrawal of troops across the Dnieper River, but Ukrainian officials remained cautious about the Russian forces intentions, with some suggesting on social media that it was a trick,\n\nGen. Sergei Surovikin, the overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, proposed taking up defensive lines on the eastern bank of the river.\n\nThe withdrawal was announced after weeks of Ukrainian advances toward the city and a race by Russia to relocate more than 100,000 of its residents.\n\n\"We will save the lives of our soldiers and fighting capacity of our units. Keeping them on the right [western] bank is futile. Some of them can be used on other fronts,\" Surovikin said.\n\nUkrainian authorities have not confirmed the move, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that the Russians were laying a trap pullout from Kherson to lure Ukrainian forces into battle.\n\nZelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also expressed skepticism.\n\nIf Ukraine wins in Kherson, it could put the Zelenskyy government in a better position to negotiate, U.S. and Western officials have said. But, they added, it could also discourage Russia from coming to the table if Putin believes he is not negotiating from a position of strength.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian forces were deliberately blowing up bridges around the city the only regional capital to be captured by Russian forces since the invasion began on Feb. 24.\n\n\"The occupiers are currently undermining absolutely all the bridges on the right bank of the Kherson region,\" Serhii Khlan, the deputy head of Khersons regional council, said in a Telegram post.\n\nUkrainian and Russian forces also clashed overnight in the town Snihurivka, around 30 miles north of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, said in a post on his Telegram channel.\n\nStremousov died Wednesday in a road accident, the head of the Moscow-appointed regional administration, Vladimir Saldo, said in a post on Telegram.\n\nA Ukrainian artillery unit fires toward Kherson late last month. Bulent Kilic / AFP via Getty Images\n\nStremousov had posted regular video updates on social media some of them from vehicles moving at high speed about the situation on the front line.\n\nRussia has fought for months to hang on to the pocket of land it holds on the west bank of the river, which bisects Ukraine, as well as Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city Russian forces have captured intact since the invasion began Feb. 24.\n\nMoscow declared at the end of September that it had annexed Kherson, along with the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, after it staged referendums that were denounced by Kyiv and the West as illegal and rigged.\n\nAnd it has poured in tens of thousands of troops as reinforcements in the region, which is also home to the huge Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper. The dam holds back an enormous reservoir and controls the water supply to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nUkrainian soldiers in trenches at the front line at the northern Kherson region Monday.

They added that all departments and ministries of the Kremlin-installed administration should evacuate to escape advancing Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has targeted the main river crossings for months, making it difficult for Russia to supply forces on the rivers west bank. Since they burst through the Russian front line at the start of October, the Ukrainians have advanced down the river.\n\nOnce that supply chain was damaged, it was \"probably inevitable\" that Russia would have to withdraw its forces, said Phillips OBrien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\n\"It was going to be a real task to keep a large army supplied on the west side of the Dnieper river without a heavy lift capability,\" he said, adding that they \"obviously tried, but they must have come to the conclusion that it couldnt happen.\"\n\nWhile the Ukrainians would be happy with their victory, he said it would now be \"very hard\" for them to attack the Russians over the Dnieper.\n\n\"Its a big river, and there are no bridges,\" he said. \"A further assault in that region is now unlikely, and a lot more of the war will move to the east and the center.\"\n\nKherson is the last major front line that could shift before winter, U.S. officials said, after which neither side is likely to make large advances.\n\nFighting is already slowing down, and the Russians are preparing lines of defense in depth around Kherson, creating \"the potential for this to be slower,\" a Western official said.",

We think the best way for this is a path from dialog to peace,\" Erdogan said, adding Ukraine's view would be important.\n\nNATO member Turkey hosted talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations earlier this year, and has sought to balance its criticism of the invasion and opposition to the sanctions.\n\n8:20 p.m.: The Russian-appointed governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, said Saturday there is no need to evacuate residents from his area, CNN reported.\n\n\"Our borders have long been securely protected. Unfounded rumors spread by enemy propaganda are deliberately trying to sow panic and destabilize the situation,\" said Balitsky on his Telegram channel.\n\n\"You must understand that the evacuation of the population of the west bank in Kherson region took place according to plan, including the evacuation of cultural heritage monuments. These are strategically necessary steps to conduct a full-scale operation in which civilians and cultural heritage sites should not suffer,\" he added.\n\nZaporizhzhia is in southern Ukraine, northeast of Kherson along the Dnipro River.\n\n7:34 p.m.: Ukraine's Military Intelligence said Saturday that Moscow and Tehran are preparing the draft agreement on the supply of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia, the Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nRussia's shortage of modern weapons because of Western sanctions is pushing Moscow to purchase weapons from world pariahs, according to Vadym Skibitskyi, a representative of the Defense Ministry's Intelligence Directorate.\n\n\"This summer Russia signed a contract with Iran to supply about 1,750 drones of two types, Shahed and Mohajer. The first batch, which was delivered to Russia, was about 350 drones, the second was about 250,\" he said.\n\n6:40 p.m.:\n\n5:55 p.m.: Cyprus on Saturday buried Archbishop Chrysostomos II, a trailblazer who butted heads with his peers to keep Russian influence in the Orthodox Church at bay and led the biggest ecclesiastical reforms in centuries, Reuters reported.\n\nChrysostomos died on November 7 from cancer at age 81.\n\nHe had led the Church of Cyprus, one of the world's oldest churches, since 2006.\n\nFour of the world's 15 Eastern Orthodox self-governing churches have recognized the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, away from the sphere of Moscow's influence.\n\nThe Church of Cyprus recognized it in 2020, with Chrysostomos standing firm against senior clerics in his church ruling body, the Holy Synod, seen as pro-Moscow.\n\nHe also opposed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n5 p.m.: Russian fertilizer producer Uralchem-Uralkali has agreed with the Netherlands, Estonia and Belgium to supply cargoes of fertilizers stranded in those countries to Africa, TASS news agency reported on Saturday, according to Reuters.\n\nIt cited Uralchem's head Dmitry Konyaev as saying the group was working with the U.N. to organize free deliveries to Africa of more than 262,000 metric tons of fertilizers stuck in EU countries.\"\n\nThe Netherlands said on Friday that following a request from the United Nations it would allow shipment to Malawi of 20,000 metric tons of Russian fertilizer that had been sitting in the port of Rotterdam because of sanctions against a Russian individual, whom it did not identify.\n\nIt said a condition of the agreement was that the sanctioned person and the Russian company would earn nothing from the transaction.\n\n4:17 p.m.: President of the European Council Charles Michel said Saturday the bloc expected China to use \"all the means at its disposal\" to push Moscow to respect international law, days before a G-20 summit expected to be dominated by the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMichel was speaking on the sidelines of a regional summit in Cambodia, where Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Southeast Asian leaders to support Kyiv, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nWhile China remains a major trading partner of the European Union, officials have repeatedly called on Beijing to publicly condemn Russia's actions, without success so far.\n\nChina has avoided criticizing Moscow for invading Ukraine, instead blaming the United States and NATO for the war.\n\n3:40 p.m.: Two vessels left Ukrainian ports Saturday, carrying a total of 27,171 metric tons of grain and other food products under the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nThree inbound vessels transited the maritime humanitarian corridor under the Black Sea Grain Initiative heading towards Ukrainian ports. The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) monitors the passage of commercial vessels through the maritime humanitarian corridor with all participants ensuring the safe passage of commercial vessels under the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nCurrently 67 vessels are waiting to move following inspection Saturday into Ukrainian ports with the capacity to export approximately 2 million tons of grain and other food products. Moreover, nine loaded vessels are waiting for inspection in Turkish territorial waters.\n\nAs of November 12, the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported from the three Ukrainian ports is 10,315,706 million metric tons.

In his weekly video address on Saturday, Scholz added that Iran can expect additional sanctions for its brutal crackdown and its decision to send hundreds of drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. European Union foreign ministers are expected to agree on additional sanctions when they meet on Monday, The Associated Press reports.\n\n2:25 p.m.: In videos and images that continue to pop up on social media, residents of Kherson hug Ukrainian soldiers and celebrate the liberation of their city after a stunning retreat of Russian forces.\n\n2:30 p.m.: Russian forces destroyed the critical infrastructure in the southern city of Kherson before fleeing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday, adding that local authorities were starting to stabilize the city.\n\n\"Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address.\n\nBut pro-Moscow forces are putting up a much stiffer fight elsewhere and Zelenskyy said the battles in the eastern Donetsk region were hellish, Reuters reports.\n\n\"(Russians) everywhere have the same goal: to humiliate people as much as possible. But we will restore everything, believe me,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukrainian troops had taken control of more than 60 settlements in the Kherson region.\n\n11:15 a.m.: In a statement, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace hailed Russias withdrawal from Ukraine's Kherson but cautioned not to \"underestimate the continuing threat posed by the Russian Federation.\"\n\n11 a.m.: Russia has made a port city in southeastern Ukraine Henichesk its new temporary administrative capital for the Kherson region, the BBC reports.\n\nHenichesk is near Russian-occupied Crimea and a long way from Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured on Friday. It is smaller than Kherson and lies on the Sea of Azov.\n\nRussias Interfax news agency says the authorities evacuated all the regional offices as well as \"statues and historic artefacts\" from the west bank of the Dnipro River that is, from Kherson city and its surroundings. More than 115,000 people were evacuated from that area, it reports.\n\n10:35 a.m.: The White House on November 12 hailed Russias withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson as an \"extraordinary victory\" for Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said \"It does look as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag - and that is quite a remarkable thing,\" RFE/RL reports.\n\n10:20 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met today with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh.\n\nState Department Spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken discussed with Kuleba the United States unwavering commitment to assist Ukraine in mitigating the effects of Russias continued attacks on critical infrastructure, including with accelerated humanitarian aid and winterization efforts.\n\nThe two reaffirmed the importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiatives renewal before it expires on November 19 and its role in supporting global food security.\n\nThey also discussed Ukraines continued effectiveness on the battlefield, with Blinken reiterating that the timing and substance of any negotiation framework remains Ukraines decision.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Russian forces retreating from Kherson city and surrounding areas have stolen around 15,000 paintings, including historic icons and other religious art, from the region, Ukraine's National Resistance Center reports.\n\nThe center said that the Russian soldiers had robbed the Oleksiy Shovkunenko Kherson Art Museum among others. The museums collection includes religious paintings of the 17th and early 20th centuries, Ukrainian art from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and works of contemporary artists.\n\nAccording to the Center, four trucks with the stolen art arrived in Simferopol, a city in Russia-occupied Crimea.\n\n9:45 am.: Renowned graffiti artist Banksy has unveiled his latest work, this time in the Ukrainian town of Borodyanka, fueling speculation that the anonymous artist was working in the war-torn country, the BBC reports.\n\nBorodyanka, was one of the towns hardest hit by Russias shelling in the early days of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine,\n\nBanksy posted a photo of the mural - a girl gymnast performing a handstand on a small pile of concrete rubble - on Instagram late on Friday. The work is painted onto the wall of a destroyed building.\n\nAnother piece of new graffiti in Banksy's signature style was spotted in Borodyanka, portraying a man resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin being flipped in judo by a small child.\n\nThe symbolism is an apparent allusion to the biblical story of David and Goliath, the unlikely triumph of the underdog, and can be viewed as a subtle nod to Putin's much-publicized love of the Japanese martial art.\n\nUkraine's Defense Department tweeted a photo of it.\n\n9:35 a.m.: Russia said on Saturday there was no agreement yet to extend the Black Sea initiative, a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain from Black Sea ports.\n\nRussia repeated its insistence on unhindered access to world markets for its own food and fertilizer exports, which even though they are not directly targeted by Western sanctions, are blocked because the sanctions cut shippers' access to finance, insurance and ports, Reuters reports.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying talks with U.N. officials in Geneva on Friday had been useful and detailed but the issue of renewing the deal - which expires in one week - had yet to be resolved.\n\nHe also said there could be no progress unless a Russian state bank that finances the farm sector was reconnected to the international SWIFT bank payments system, from which it has been cut off by Western sanctions.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is pressing Southeast Asian countries for political and material support in his countys fight against Russia.\n\nThe Associated Press reports, Kuleba accused Moscow of playing \"hunger games\" with the world by blocking shipments of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products from being exported to global markets.\n\nKuleba told reporters Saturday on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit that the world needs to pressure Russia not to object to the extension of a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain and fertilizer, which is due to expire November 19.\n\nMore than just calling for the deal to continue, however, Kuleba accused Russian inspectors of \"quiet sabotage,\" by intentionally dragging their feet in allowing shipments through.\n\n9:15 a.m.: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit (ASEAN) Saturday. He thanked the U.S. for the support the American people have shown Ukraine. Ukraine was invited to the ASEAN summit for the first time this year.\n\n8:50 a.m.: The Ukrainian military is carrying out \"stabilization measures\" near the city of Kherson following the end of its eight-month occupation by Russian forces. People across Ukraine celebrated after the Kremlin announcement that its troops had withdrawn to the other side of the Dnipro River from Kherson, the only regional capital captured by Russias military during the ongoing invasion.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the General Staff of Ukraines Armed Forces reported Saturday that the Russians were fortifying their battle lines on the rivers eastern bank. Ukrainian officials from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on down cautioned that while special Ukrainian military units had reached Kherson city, a full \"liberation\" deployment still was underway.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense tweeted a video with snapshots of a liberated Kherson, pledging \"we will never abandon those who are caught in the jaws of a monster.\"\n\n5:29 a.m.: Brussels and its major development partners announced on Friday a billion-dollar boost to efforts to export Ukraine's grain harvest, despite Russia's invasion and threat to block Black Sea ports, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe European Commission, European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank will invest the funds to improve and expand so-called \"Solidarity Lanes.\"\n\nThese are routes to bring Kyiv's huge agricultural harvest, and some other imports and exports, overland from the war-torn country and onto the world market via safer European Union ports.\n\nFriday's announcement commits a major funding boost to the project, with cash to reduce waiting times for trucks and trains crossing to Poland and Romania from Moldova and Ukraine.\n\n4:59 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces continued ground assaults around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Vuhledar while Ukrainian forces continued to target Russian force concentrations in Zaporizhzhia oblast.\n\nUkrainian troops, the assessment noted, have made major territorial gains throughout Kherson Oblast on Nov. 11 and will continue consolidating control of the western bank in the coming days.\n\n3:27 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russian forces likely destroyed road and rail bridges over the Dnipro River as part of their withdrawal from Kherson.\n\nKherson was the only regional capital city captured since February by Russian forces, the update said, so the withdrawal brings significant reputational damage. The withdrawal is a public recognition of the difficulties faced by Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nIt is likely that Ukraine has retaken large areas of Kherson oblast on the west bank of the Dnipro River, the update said, and that its forces are now largely in control of Kherson city itself.\n\n2:11 a.m.: Once purely the stuff of action movie plots, the prospect of the lights going out in Europe's biggest economy has become a conceivable threat during the current energy crisis, Reuters reported.\n\nLooking to be the heroes in a real-life blackout, a growing number of Germans are turning to citizens' courses to learn how to act if they find themselves plunged into darkness.\n\n\"If the electricity goes out then absolutely nothing works any more. And we need to understand what 'nothing working' really means,\" said Birgitt Eberlin, an instructor at the Workers' Samaritan Federation (ASB).\n\n1:09 a.m.: The White House on Saturday hailed what it said appeared to be an \"extraordinary victory\" for Ukraine in recapturing the city of Kherson from Russian occupiers, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\n\"It does look as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag -- and that is quite a remarkable thing,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on the way to the ASEAN summit in Cambodia.\n\n12:02 a.m.:",

Mark Milley's remarks offer the highest U.S. estimate of casualties to date in the nearly nine-month-old conflict and came as Ukraine and Russia face a potential winter lull in fighting that experts say could offer an opportunity for some kind of negotiations.\n\nAsked about prospects for diplomacy in Ukraine, Milley noted that the early refusal to negotiate in World War One compounded human suffering and led to millions more casualties.\n\n\"So, when there's an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved ... seize the moment,\" Milley told the Economic Club of New York.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Russia announced its troops would withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River near the strategic southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, in a significant setback for Moscow and potential turning point in the war.\n\nSome experts say the latest setback for Moscow could allow Ukraine to negotiate from a position of strength while others argue that Russia might use negotiations to buy time to reset and refit its forces for a renewed spring offensive.\n\nMilley said the initial indicators suggested Russia was following through with its withdrawal from Kherson. But he cautioned that it could take time to complete.\n\n\"It won't take them a day or two, this is going to take them days and perhaps even weeks to pull those forces south of that river,\" Milley said, estimating that Russia probably had 20,000 to 30,000 troops north of the Dnipro River in that area.\n\nThe United States and its NATO allies have stopped short of direct intervention in Ukraine, but are arming, advising and enabling its military to defend Kyiv against Russia's invading armies.\n\nMilley said the conflict so far had turned anywhere from 15 million to 30 million Ukrainians into refugees and killed probably 40,000 Ukrainian civilians.\n\n\"You're looking at well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded. Same thing probably on the Ukrainian side. A lot of human suffering,\" Milley said.\n\nDespite the high casualty numbers, U.S. officials say that Moscow has been unable to achieve its objectives in Ukraine and have raised questions about how long Russia will be able to sustain an invasion that has also decimated much of its mechanized ground forces and sapped artillery stockpiles.",

But before the occupying troops left the strategic city, they emptied one of its most important artistic institutions.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian militarys National Resistance Center, Russian soldiers looted nearly 15,000 objects from the Oleksiy Shovkunenko Kherson Art Museum and other cultural venues in the region two weeks ago. The move came just days after Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in Kherson and three other Ukrainian territories, effectively legalizing the \"evacuation\" of cultural heritage.\n\nThe Kherson Art Museum confirmed the theft in a Facebook post, explaining that between October 31 and November 3, three or four dozen Russian troops arrived at the institution and \"took out works of art and office equipmenteverything they saw, everything their raking hands could reach.\"\n\nPaintings and other works of art were \"wrapped in some kind of rag,\" rather than proper packing supplies, according to the museum, and loaded on trucks and buses. The looted goods were then transferred to Simferopol in Crimea.\n\nThe museum explained at the time that its administrators did not know what was stolen, but said there was little doubt that the \"most valuable\" items in the collection were targeted.\n\n\"In their opinion, this is called evacuation,\" the museums post read. \"In our opinion, [it is] looting under the slogans of preserving cultural values.\"\n\nThe Russians looted the Kherson art museum and brought valuable works of the XVII-XX centuries to Simferopol. Kherson is under temporary occupation now. And then you ask why precious ?? artworks in russian museums? Because they stole it. @suspilne_news pic.twitter.com/v2igpbKzj0 Ukrainian Art History (@ukr_arthistory) November 7, 2022\n\nPrior to the incident, the museums collection included religious paintings from the 17th and 20th centuries, Ukrainian art from the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and contemporary art from the last 100 years. In a media briefing addressing the theft, the head of the Kherson City Councils Department for Culture, Svitlana Dumynska, called it \"one of the most impressive collections of regional museums in Ukraine.\"\n\nDumynska added that the Kherson local history museum was also targeted by Russian Troops, \"but we have much less information about it.\"\n\nBy November 3, Kherson police opened a criminal investigation into the theft, classifying it and other attacks in the region as a war crime.\n\nDays later, images that allegedly showed the stolen Kherson Art Museum objects being unloaded at the Central Museum of Taurida in Simferopol circulated on Ukrainian social media. In another Facebook post, the museum identified several works of art in the pictures, including paintings by Ukrainian modernists Ivan Pokhytonov and Mykhailo Andrienko-Nechitaylo.\n\nIn a November 10 interview with the Moscow Timesan independent news outletthe Taurida museums director, Andrei Malgin, confirmed that the looted artworks had indeed landed in Simferopol.\n\n\"Due to the introduction of martial law on the territory of the Kherson region, I have been instructed to take the exhibits of the Kherson Art Museum for temporary storage and ensure their safety until they are returned to their rightful owner,\" Malgin said.\n\nThe Kherson Art Museum has been closed since the city was seized by Russian soldiers in the early days of the invasion. The institutions director, Alina Dotsenko, departed for Kyiv in May after Russian occupiers demanded that the museum stage a propagandistic exhibition, according to the Art Newspaper.\n\nThis month, Dotsenko told Ukrainian media that, before she left, she convinced the Russians that the museums collection had been relocated in preparation for a planned renovation. She also deleted information about the institutions holdings from its computers.\n\nBut Dotensko said that another museum employee, curator Natalya Koltsova, led Russian troops to the stored collection in July. Koltsova, whom Dotsenko had fired the year prior, was brought back in to the work with the Russians, and a former cabaret singer was installed as a puppet director.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:",

                "cc_text": "Foreign Affairs Council: Press remarks by High Representative Josep Borrell after the meeting\n\nCheck against delivery!\n\nGood afternoon, bonne aprs-midi,\n\nOn a eu un long Conseil [Affaires trangres]. On est au Conseil depuis 8:30 ce matin, a fait neuf heures [de runion].\n\nIt has been a long [Foreign Affairs] Council but a productive one. I am very happy about the result.\n\nFirst of all, because we reaffirmed our top priority. This top priority is to continue supporting Ukraine. I will leave for tomorrow the military aspects of this issue. Tomorrow, we have a Defence Ministers Council where we will continue discussing about what is happening in Ukraine from the defence and the military point of view. But certainly, the [Foreign] Ministers also talked about it.\n\nWe listened to Minister [of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro] Kuleba, who joined us [remotely] to debrief on the latest developments. We had the opportunity to reconfirm to him that the European Union stands with Ukraine until Ukraines victory. This has to be understood under Ukrainian parameters. Until then, we stay united in our support to Ukraine.\n\nA good proof of that is that today, we launched the EU Military Assistance Mission [to Ukraine (EUMAM)] with the purpose of training at least 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers. It has been decided, it has been agreed, it has been implemented in record time. It is the first time I see a Military Assistance Mission to go [ahead] as quickly as this one, through the whole procedure. I hope that, by the end of the month, it will start working.\n\nMember States discussed about the amount of our military support. More details will come tomorrow, but allow me to say that we should not confuse the 3.1 billion from the European Peace Facility, with the [combined] military support of the European Union and its Member States to Ukraine. Sometimes you can read some figures, a comparison between the United States effort and the European effort.\n\nI asked my military staff to do the best estimation of which is the amount of our military support to Ukraine, and I can advance a figure that tomorrow will be discussed with the Defence Ministers.\n\nI think I can say that at least 8 billion in military equipment have already been provided to Ukraine by the European Union and the Member States. It is about 45% of the effort done by the United States, so it is not negligible. We are not talking about 3.1 billion, but about 8 billion on military support.\n\nTomorrow, as I said, I will continue discussing these figures with the Defence Ministers and study how these resources have been implemented, with which kind of defence material, and its effectiveness.\n\nAll in all, our approach to Russia remains clear. We agreed with the Ministers on a common message along the following lines.\n\nFirst, we will continue isolating Russia internationally. We will continue imposing restrictive measures against [the] Russian economy. We stand ready to continue reinforcing restrictive measures and target third countries involvement, especially the ones who [we know] are providing arms and military support Iran and Belarus.\n\nThis morning, we discussed with the leader of Belarusian [United] Democratic Forces, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. We reconfirmed to her our solidarity with the people of Belarus, and we will continue upholding sanctions against Lukashenkos regime.\n\nAs I said, tomorrow I will go deeper into the military aspects of the situation.\n\nIt is clear that our sanctions are weakening the Russian economy. They weaken Russias capacity to buy and update technology. We never expected the sanctions were going to finish the war, but certainly, they are weakening the capacity of the Russian army to renew its material, especially in front of the enormous losses that Russia is suffering in the battlefield. It has weakened its capacity to lead a war based on terror against the Ukrainian people.\n\nPutins Russia wants to put Ukrainians into the darkness and the cold. They are destroying the electricity systems of this country: millions of Ukrainians do not have electricity. The purpose is, during the winter, to put them in inhumane situation in their cities.\n\nWe will continue supporting the Ukrainian people and ensure accountability for the violations of international law and war crimes committed in Ukraine. The news coming from the liberated cities are really important to know what has happened there. Together with the [European] Commission, we are looking at the options at our disposal to ensure accountability, and the discussion will continue on that.\n\nWe are working closely with our NATO partners and worldwide, [with] everybody who is ready to defend the international order based on rules.\n\nWe are enhancing our resilience, in particular on energy security and critical infrastructure, countering Russias hybrid threats, and information manipulation. We are supporting civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia. Our immediate support focuses on supporting Ukraine to resist Russias increased systematic targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.\n\nPutin is unable to conquer Ukraine. Putin is unable to defeat the Ukrainian army, Putin is withdrawing. The Russian Army has withdrawn to the other side of the Dnipro River, and it is trying to compensate these military failures with efforts to increase the human suffering of the Ukrainian people especially now as the winter is approaching.\n\nAs I said, we are working with our partners to repair and replace Ukrainian energy infrastructure. This means an enormous effort.\n\nIn parallel, we are redoubling our efforts on outreach to third countries, in particular on the issue of food security. I want to mention that just today, we have published a joint statement with the United States Secretary of State, [Antony] Blinken, and the United Kingdom [Foreign] Secretary [James] Cleverly, and the High Representative of the European Union. The three of us going together with a public statement clarifying the issue of sanctions in relation to Russian food and fertilisers exports. Please, have a look at this communication from the three of us United States, United Kingdom and the European Union to clarify the conditions in which operators can participate in the exports of food and fertilisers from Russia.\n\nI want to stress that, on our side, thanks to the EU Solidarity Lanes, we have been able to support the export of 15 million tons of agrifood products between May and October [2022]. And, today, the Commission announced a new humanitarian aid package of 210 million for 15 countries around the world, especially from Africa, to Afghanistan, [and] Latin America, to address their immediate needs.\n\nNow, the international community needs to ensure the renewable and practical implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond the 19 November deadline. It is very important that this initiative brokered by the United Nations and Turkey could be implemented. But do not forget why this initiative has been taking place: it is not because a natural disaster, it is not because of a tsunami in the Black Sea, it is not because there were pirates. It is because the blockade of the Russian Army to the exports of Ukraine - using hunger as a weapon.\n\nRussia has no reasons, no legal ground to block food [from] going out from Ukraine to the international markets. What Russia has been doing is illegal and affecting first [of all] the lives of people from vulnerable countries around the world. Russia must stop weaponising food.\n\nThis is the strong message that the Foreign Affairs Council has issued today: Russia must stop weaponising food.\n\nBack to the Councils agenda, we discussed about the Great Lakes situation.\n\nYou know that the Great Lakes region in Africa is a hotspot, a geostrategic hotspot. This region can become a powerhouse for development of the entire African continent. It is a region of many challenges but also many opportunities.\n\nWe see there is strong potential we could achieve in such a region. It has potential which is very much unmatched. We can make a difference, be realistic in our ambition and focusing on sectors where we have a real added value.\n\nWe agreed on the need for a [renewed] strategy on the Great Lakes. It will be adopted in the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council to support the region, to move from tensions to trust, from trafficking to trade, and from competition to regional integration.\n\nBack to home, we are very worried about the situation in the Western Balkans. In the Western Balkans, several crises are looming, and partners feel the immediate damaging impact of Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The shockwaves of this war are hitting the Western Balkans.\n\nTo counter that, we are stepping up our engagement as the Western Balkans remain our geostrategic priority - the closest and most important geostrategic priority. And I want to insist on the basic idea that the future of the Western Balkans lies in the European Union. This is our message ahead of the next European Union - Western Balkans Summit on 6 December.\n\nDuring the weekend, I have been very busy in Paris discussing with Serbia and Kosovo. I briefed Ministers about my engagement as facilitator of the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue with Prime Minister [of Kosovo, Albin] Kurti and President [of Serbia, Aleksandar] Vui to defuse the unnecessary and counterproductive tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, to defuse these tensions that are reaching a very, very dangerous level.\n\nI can say that we are facing the most serious, the most dangerous crisis since 2013 of the last ten years. Both parties both parties - need to urgently show readiness to find a way forward to lower these tensions. It is not acceptable for either party to violate or ignore their Dialogue obligations.\n\nChief negotiators will start working here in Brussels on the next steps. They will start working tonight. The Kosovo side is already arriving tonight. I am ready to convene the leaders if negotiators manage to advance towards a practical solution on the issue of [licence] plates before the 21 November deadline. We cannot reach this date without having an agreement or we will be on the edge of a dangerous situation. You know, the withdrawal of the Serbs from the institutions, the dismissing of the police, of the judiciary, of the measures, has created a vacuum in the north of Kosovo. In this vacuum, the worst can happen. Both parties need to show more flexibility.\n\nThe message from the Council is clear: we need clear progress. We presented a proposal. I thank Germany and France for supporting strongly this proposal. Kosovo Serbs need to return to institutions. Kosovo authorities must show flexibility on licence plates and work on the implementation of the agreement on the Association/Community of Serb Majority Municipalities without delay.\n\nWith partners aspiring for a European future, we expect a European behaviour. We expect willingness to find European solutions: this is a basic precondition. They are at a crossroads now. They have to decide which way they want to go: towards the European Union or towards the past.\n\nWe also focused on the hybrid threats directed at the region and agreed to step up our work and support our partners on cyber-defence. We have condemned the important attacks that Albania has been suffering and also strongly condemn the cyber-attack that hit Montenegros IT infrastructure during the month of August. We will be looking for more support for Montenegro to face this.\n\nAfter spending quite a lot of time discussing about the situation in the Western Balkans, we raised the situation in Lebanon and the deepening political vacuum that could bring it to an economic collapse.\n\nOnce again, it is crucial for Lebanon to urgently conclude Presidential elections to unlock these long-overdue economic reforms and get international support. We did not rule out any option to unblock the current political stalemate, including possible sanctions.\n\nFinally, let me stop this long explanation: we discussed about Iran and the unabated repressive reaction of the authorities to the public discontent, showed by courageous demonstrators in the streets of the cities of Iran. In particular, we salute the bravery of the Iranian women who continue demanding basic respect of their fundamental rights.\n\nTo support them, today the Council adopted another 31 listings under the Iran Human Rights Regime.\n\nWe also insist on Iran to stop providing arms that Russia is using to commit atrocities against the Ukrainian people. The drones provided by Iran to Russia allegedly months ago, [before] the war started, are being used in this war and it is a clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231. We have already adopted sanctions in this regard weeks ago and we will take further steps if needed.\n\nFinally, I have to stress that we see a backlash against gender equality and womens rights globally not only in Iran. For example, the Taliban just announced a further restrictions on womens freedom of movement, barring women from entering public parks and gyms. We strongly condemn this.\n\nWe set out today our clear and strong position to apply efforts to counter this global trend against women, in the conclusions on Women, Peace and Security that the Council has adopted.\n\nI personally had the occasion to meet with groups of Afghan women who escaped from Afghanistan during the days of the evacuation of Kabul, and of knowing better from them of the very sad situation of the women in Afghanistan. Lets not forget them.\n\nThis is, more or less, what we have been discussing along these nine hours: Russia and Ukraine, Kherson withdrawal, EU Military Assistance Mission, military support, Western Balkans, Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, Belarus, Lebanon, Irans human rights violations.\n\nI remain at your disposal.\n\nQ&A\n\nQ. Mr Borrell, I am very impressed by your support to Ukraine, because it is a very big support that you will accept 15,000 soldiers and officers to train them. My question is on your diplomatic dealing. After the removal of Russian forces from Kherson city, Ukraine feels the soft pressure of United States and Turkey to start negotiations with Russia. What is your position the position of the EU? Because Ukraine has a separate position, not the same as the United States to start the negotiations and to resolve the problems, the conflict and war with diplomatic meanings. We hear the same rhetoric from Ankara, from Turkey. What is the official position of Brussels?\n\nLook, I am not representing Ankara here. I am not representing the US, neither. I am representing my colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Council. Je pense que je me suis bien exprim avant, je vais rpter la phrase: we will continue supporting Ukraine until Ukraine's victory, and it has to be understood under Ukrainian parameters.\n\nQ. Deux questions, si je peux. La premire est lie lUkraine et lIran. On a entendu ce matin le nouveau ministre des affaires trangres sudois [Tobias Billstrm] dire que le support soutien lUkraine doit venir avant tout. Cest une question lie laccord sur le nuclaire, donc je vous demande si les fournitures darmes de lIran la Russie peuvent, en quelque sorte, avoir un impact direct sur le JCPOA? Deuxime question: dans votre introduction, vous navez pas mentionn limmigration. On nous a dit que le ministre italien [des affaires trangres, Antonio Tajani] avait demand discuter de ce point aujourdhui. Je voulais savoir si vous en avez discut et avec quel rsultat ventuellement.\n\nLook, they are different issues. The JCPOA is a tasking of the United Nations Security Council, I am acting as Coordinator of the negotiations in order to review a deal to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear. It is following its path with a lot of difficulties and stalemates, it is still there. Lets see what is happening. It has nothing to do with other issues, which certainly concern us. I have made a reference to sanctions for human rights abuses, women, demonstrators; I expressed also my concern about the supply of arms from Iran to Russia it is clear that Iranian drones have been used, there is a lot of evidence. There is speculation about the possibility of using [Iranian] ballistic missiles but there is no evidence at least not yet of the use and supply of this type of arms. But I want to make a difference: I will continue trying to work in order to fulfil all the balances between the parts engaged in negotiating the JCPOA and, at the same time, we will act as we are acting on other frontlines like the ones we have taken today.\n\nMigration, yes, certainly, we discussed about migration. It was not a specific point in the agenda but, how can we [not]? We should talk about migration: some events in the Mediterranean make it unavoidable. Yes, [there] has been an exchange of views and we will have to continue discussing about it. But, today, nothing concrete.\n\nQ. Can you tell me more about this military assistance mission for Ukraine? Where will it take place only in Poland or also in other countries? At what stage are the negotiations on 18 billion of aids for Ukraine now? Because I know that Hungary does not support this aid for Ukraine.\n\nThank you for very precise questions. It is easier to answer when the questions are focusing on specific issues. Yes, we are going to train 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers, not all of them in Poland. It will be several different Member States that will provide the basis, not only training, not only material, not only trainees, but concrete places in which this training will take place. I can tell you that the country that I know best will also participate in the training of these soldiers on their soil. So, several Member States will be participating, and the training will take place in several different member states, not only in Poland.\n\nSecondly, as far as I understood, the country you mentioned is not opposing to the macro-financial assistance of 18 billion to Ukraine. Only the discussion is about how to implement it; through common debt or by bilateral agreements? But the principle of providing a macro-financial assistance to Ukraine has been agreed unanimously.\n\nQ. You said that the European proposal for more structural relations and a way out of the current crisis is on the table. I know it is sensitive, but could you be any more specific about the key elements of this proposal? So, what do you want the partners to agree on? Is there a timeframe in which you would like those discussions to come to any result? Secondly, if I may, you said also previously that Kosovo should align its actions on licence plates with past Dialogue agreements: does that mean that Pristina is in violation of previous agreements on car plates? Would you expect them to prolong, for example, the validity of so-called status neutral car plates?\n\nWhat I wanted to say, let me be careful with the words, is that everybody has to agree with past agreements. It does not make sense to work on new agreements if the agreements that were accepted in the past are not being implemented. And certainly, there is the issue of the [licence] plates, of the identity cards - for which Serbia made a step forward during the summer. There is the issue of the Association/Community] of the Serb Municipalities. I am not going to make the list of the issues on which I am asking for flexibility and commitment.\n\nAnd the proposal that we presented, and now I am happy to say that France and Germany have been very much supportive of this proposal. The so-called \"Franco-German proposal\" is in fact the Franco-German support for the proposal presented by me and [the EU Special Representative for the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue] Miroslav Lajk. It is a proposal, lets say, European proposal that tries to go out of the crisis management mode.\n\nIn the last two, three years, I have been permanently in crisis management, from one crisis to another, solving yesterdays crisis and waiting for tomorrows crisis, be it [licence] plates, be it whatever. This is not the way you are solving the problem. You have to look for a more structural approach, looking at the deep questions, and try to prevent the crises from happening. And well, this is a step forward, this is a new approach, and I have to say that both parties were, I would not say agreeing, but not rejecting the proposal, not rejecting which is already a lot. But now again, we are in crisis mode, and we have to solve this crisis of the next week, before the next week a crisis has to be avoided. And my hope is that if we manage to avoid a big clash now that there is no police in the north of Kosovo, now that there is no judiciary, that there is a vacuum of institutions. If we are able to overcome this very dangerous moment, then we should be able to look at the problem with different lenses, not of crisis management but of structural solutions. And I think it is possible, and the European path requires that. I cannot go into the details. It has two pages, no more than that, but that could represent a compass, for looking for a solution which does not depend on everyday crisis.\n\nQ. Going back to the Iranian sanctions' discussion, the German Foreign Minister [Annalena Baerbock], on her way into the meeting, was talking about the idea of listing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation by the EU. Is this something that could be a next step as you have alluded to, or this completely off the table?\n\nWell, on the table this issue has not been discussed, but let me be concrete. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps is already listed. It is already listed under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime and, also, in the latest listing on human rights violations. I do not know what kind of listing my colleague was mentioning, but you should know that this Revolutionary Guard is already listed under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime. We have different sanctions regime: \"listed\" does not mean anything unless you tell me which kind of sanctions regime you are implementing. It is also included in the latest listing for human rights violations.\n\nThe addition of an organisation in the so-called European Union terrorists list is subject to a Council decision and regulation that has to be adopted by unanimity. Under European Union law because we are [in] a state of law, we are being governed by law for anything under our law, the prerequisite for listing an organisation on the terrorists list is a national decision first, that has to be adopted by the competent national authorities on the basis of a court decision, on the basis of a judiciary decision, or a proscription order by an administrative authority at the national level. It means that at the European Union level, alone, [we] cannot act without such a national decision that has to be based on something supported by an administrative decision or a judiciary decision. It is the way we work: I cannot say tomorrow in the morning, \"ah, you are a terrorist organisation\" - no. Things require procedures and require legal procedures.\n\nQ. Je vous poserai le mois prochain la question sur la nouvelle Stratgie pour les Grands Lacs. Entre temps, sur la guerre en Ukraine: vous soulignez donc la faon dont les Vingt-Sept ont ritr leur soutien lUkraine jusqu la victoire et selon les paramtres fixs par lUkraine. Ma question est celle-ci: est-ce que, selon votre comprhension, selon la comprhension des Vingt-Sept, ces paramtres impliquent la reconqute des territoires perdus depuis 2014 et pas seulement depuis le 24 fvrier 2022? Et si c'est le cas, est-ce que vous sentez un soutien unanime des Vingt-Sept pour cette entreprise, ce but ?\n\nNo, I have not gone as far as you pretend. I said that it is up to the Ukrainians to decide what does it mean for them: \"victory\"- is up to them. The country which has been destroyed is Ukraine. The people frozen are Ukrainians. The 7 million people that fled Ukraine are Ukrainians. The casualties are Ukrainians, so let Ukrainians decide. I think it is quite logical. How can I say to the Ukrainians what they have to do? The only thing I can tell them is: \"we will support you\".\n\nEt demain, on va discuter, avec les ministres de la Dfense, plus en dtails des questions militaires. Mais cest vident quen se retirant de Kherson, larme russe a subi dj une dfaite trs grave: elle sest retire sans combattre, peut-tre pour viter le pire. Il faut quand mme savoir que la capacit de nuisance dont Moscou dispose est encore trs importante, mais elle ne lutilise [non] pas pour se battre militairement, mais pour dtruire les infrastructures critiques [de lUkraine]. Et mme si les dfenses anti-ariennes sont capables dintercepter les drones avec une remarquable efficacit, cest vident que la Russie de Poutine est embarque dans la volont [de vouloir] dtruire un pays. Donc je pense que si on veut viter de penser la reconstruction, il faut viter la destruction. Si vous voulez viter davoir reconstruire, vitez la destruction. Now. This is the key for me.\n\nWhich are the Ukrainian parameters, the Ukrainians will decide.\n\nLink to the video: https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-233001",

                "cc_text": "Putin does not have much to lose from engaging in peace negotiations, but Zelenskyy does.\n\nAs Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu announced his armys withdrawal from the key Ukrainian city of Kherson, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it creates a window of opportunity for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nRussias full-scale invasion of its neighbour has already lasted for more than eight months, and casualties and destruction have mounted day after day. Milley said more than 100,000 Russian soldiers may have been killed and wounded in this war while Ukraine \"probably\" suffered a similar number of casualties.\n\nTo stress his point about peace, Milley evoked the great powers failure to negotiate at an earlier stage in World War I a mistake that led to millions more casualties and catastrophic developments in several countries, notably the Russian Empire.\n\nMilleys remarks represent a change of tack in the official US rhetoric, raising questions about a possible push for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. What is more, in the weeks preceding the Russian withdrawal from Kherson, the United States and Russia resumed communication about Ukraine at the level of top security officials.\n\nBut are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin willing to negotiate? And how would opening a dialogue reflect on their governments?\n\nUkraine demands a full withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory, reparations and punishment for war criminals. Zelenskyy himself has signed a decree which unequivocally bans him from talking to Putin. Kyivs official position effectively amounts to a demand for regime change in Russia as a condition for talks.\n\nMoscow, for its part, has long dropped its earlier goal of removing the Ukrainian government and has officially asserted that it is ready for talks with no conditions.\n\nFrom the Ukrainian perspective, negotiations are a way for Russia to buy time at the moment when the Ukrainian army has seized the initiative on the frontline and has liberated swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nBut Zelenskyys government is reportedly under pressure from Washington to soften its uncompromising stance. Likely reacting to these signals, the Ukrainian president said in a recent interview with CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour that he was \"ready to talk to Russia but with a different Russia, one that is truly ready for peace\".\n\nMeanwhile, on social media, Zelenskyys security adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak has been reiterating that the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory is unattainable while Putin remains in power. \"Therefore, we are constructive in our assessment: We will talk with the next leader of RF,\" he wrote in a recent tweet, referring to the Russian Federation.\n\nIt is hard to say whether Kyivs \"all or nothing\" rhetoric derives from a deep conviction that it is going to prevail or if it is just posturing to mobilise people in the face of aggression and avoid signalling weakness to the adversary.\n\nWhile Ukraine has not exhausted its offensive potential, it is doubtful it can sustain a war of attrition with its more powerful neighbour in the long run, even with all the military and financial support it gets from the West.\n\nThe country is expected to lose 35 percent of its GDP by the end of the year, while Russia will see its economy shrink by 4.5 percent, according to the World Bank. Russias missile and drone attacks this fall have destroyed up to 40 percent of the countrys energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy recently admitted.\n\nIf the air strikes continue, many Soviet-era apartment blocks, in which most Ukrainians reside, will become unlivable because they depend on central heating provided by thermal plants. This could create a wave of refugees that the European Union would not be able to accommodate. Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has mentioned the possibility of evacuating 3 million people from Ukraines capital alone.\n\nRussia is yet to deploy most of the 300,000 men it claims to have mobilised since September. It is also buying more drones and high-precision missiles from Iran, while ramping up its own production. While withdrawing from Kherson, it is slowly restarting offensive operations in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe moment when Ukraine appears to be the prevailing side is also the moment when it can make maximum gains in peace talks. If Russia seizes the initiative on the front line again, its appetite for territorial and political trophies will rise exponentially.\n\nRussias departure from Kherson and Washingtons subsequent softening of tone on the possibility of talks provides the vague contours of what a future settlement may look like.\n\nBy withdrawing from the right bank of the Dnipro River, Moscow abandons the hope of seizing Odesa and turning Ukraine into a landlocked country at least for now.\n\nBut seizing Odesa extends far beyond Russias territorial claims over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. After a sham \"referendum\" in September, Russia also officially annexed the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, but it left itself room for manoeuvre by not defining their borders. After withdrawing from the city of Kherson, Moscow still controls most of the Kherson region.\n\nFor Putin to be able to declare victory, it is sufficient to hold onto the territory Russia is already occupying. He can even afford to lose some more. Russias conformist majority has never shown any serious appetite for territorial expansion or has bothered about which bits of Ukrainian territory their country will control once peace is restored.\n\nPutins war in Ukraine is more of a punitive operation than an imperialist land grab. As long as the outcome of the war is more humiliating for Ukraine than the implementation of the Minsk agreements, which Moscow tried to impose on Kyiv in the run-up to the full-scale invasion in February, Putin will feel vindicated. The implementation would have resulted in the emergence of an autonomous Donbas region in eastern Ukraine effectively controlled by Russia and would have prevented Ukraines NATO membership.\n\nConflict with the US-led West, as the Kremlin frames the war in Ukraine, is now the main source of legitimacy for Putins government, which is why it launched the aggression in the first place. Losing some of the occupied territory will not necessarily undermine the government. On the contrary, it may lead to more people rallying behind the leader in the face of what many Russians perceive as an existential threat.\n\nMeanwhile, the West appears to be both unable and unwilling to reach out to the Russian population with a vision of a better future without Putin. For many politicians, Russia is little more than a convenient enemy. That makes it easier for Putin to maintain power.\n\nZelenskyy, on the other hand, is on a mission to deliver on maximalist expectations while also facing belligerent opposition which is scrutinising his every move, ready to accuse him of betraying Ukraines interests.\n\nHe must prove that Ukrainians enormous sacrifices were not in vain and they have gained something tangible by refusing to succumb to Russian pressure to implement the Minsk agreements. That will be much harder to achieve, which is why Kyiv is trying to regain as much territory as possible and keep up its momentum.\n\nThe trick is figuring out the right time to draw a line and sue for peace.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeeras editorial stance.",

The Kremlin has said it will rejoin the UN-administered grain export corridor from Ukraine after pulling out over the weekend after a drone attack on Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol. Moscows humiliating climbdown came two days after a large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russias warnings that it would be \"unsafe\" without its participation, and after high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey one of the guarantors of the scheme with the UN and Russia. Russias withdrawal had reignited fears over global hunger and food prices that had been alleviated by the inauguration of the scheme earlier this year which allowed cargo ships to move Ukrainian gain without fear of being targeted. Confirming Turkish reports that Moscow would be lifting its suspension, the Russian defence ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. \"The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\" the ministry statement said.

Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820 feet) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was \"destroyed\", according to Agence French-Presse (AFP). Four leaks emerged on Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 after what seismic experts suggested were underwater explosions. Swedish inspectors found evidence of sabotage during their investigation, which Russia has attempted to blame on the UK in recent days.

The theatre reopened to a production of an adaptation of George Orwells famous novel, 1984. Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images While the air raid sirens continue to be a fixture of life in Kyiv, life is continuing, including rehearsals and performances at theatres in the city. A reporter for Al Jazeera has spoken to actors at the Theatre on Podil in the Ukrainian capital, as they ran through their lines before the curtain gets raised. \"In one moment,\" actor Mykhailo Kryshtal said, \"a rocket could land near you and everything could come to an end. These factors arent helping.\" \"The fact that we are still performing for our audience is resistance itself,\" says Kryshtal. \"Because we are not afraid. We didnt run away.\" The theatre shut as the invasion began, and only reopened in June. The production is of The Emigrants, a 1970s Polish drama. Productions often get interrupted by air raid sirens, causing performers and the audience to gather in the lobby. Director Volodymyr Kudlinsky said: \"We were surprised that the audiences who stayed in Kyiv started to buy tickets and came to the performances for the same prices as before the war,\" he says. \"People were ready. Through buying tickets, they supported us and theatre itself, the city and the country.\"\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.56 EDT Authorities in Kyiv have begun shutting down the Ukrainian capitals power network, after a supply in consumption, Reuters reports.

It follows the European Union taking similar steps in October. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian government claimed that Iran was due to send another 200 combat drones in addition to those that have already been provided. Shahed Aviation Industries, along with three men, Maj Gen Mohammed Hossein Bagheri, Gen Syed Hojatollah Qureishi and Brig Gen Syed Aghajani have been given travel bans and had their assets frozen. The Swiss government has so far refused to follow the EU line on sanctions with Iran.

Russian airlines carried 9.87 million passengers in September, Russias statistics agency Rosstat said on Wednesday, down a fifth from September 2021. Western countries banned Russian airlines from using their airspace in response to Moscow sending its armed forces into Ukraine in February, cutting them off from lucrative routes to Europe and the United States. Aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have also stopped selling planes, parts and equipment to Russian airlines, forcing some companies to cannibalise existing jets to get hold of spare parts, Reuters reports. Traffic for the entire first nine months of the year was down 13.1% to 72.6 million passengers, Rosstat said.\n\nUpdated at 12.03 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 12.00 EDT Summary of the day so far As it has just gone 6pm in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, here is a roundup of todays news so far. The Kremlin has said it will rejoin the UN-administered grain export corridor from Ukraine, after pulling out over the weekend following a drone attack on Russian warships in the port of Sevastopol.\n\nMoscows humiliating climbdown came two days after a large convoy of ships moved a record amount of grain in defiance of Russias warnings that it would be unsafe without its participation , and after high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey one of the guarantors of the scheme with the UN and Russia.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said it had received written guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia . \"The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\" the ministry statement said.\n\nThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, will be seen as having successfully called the Russians bluff to blockade Ukrainian ports or even sink civilian cargo ships carrying grain abroad . The Turkish leader had said exports of grain from Ukraine would continue with or without Russian approval and appears to have brokered the Russian climbdown.\n\nSeparately, Moscow said it would summon the UK ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, over its accusation that \"British specialists\" were involved in the Sevastopol attack. Russia has, without providing evidence, repeatedly blamed the UK for Saturdays audacious attack, in which a swarm of drones attacked Russias Black Sea fleet.\n\nThe governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, told Ukraines Hromadske TV that Kyiv region is once again becoming an \"outpost\" in Russias strategy to target the capital. Earlier Kuleba gave an update on the energy situation in the region on the Telegram messaging service, saying 16,000 homes remain without electricity.\n\nRussian security services in Crimea claim to have foiled a plot to sabotage energy supplies in the region by Ukraines security service and have detained a man over it.\n\nRussia has said it is fully committed to preventing nuclear war , and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons is its highest priority. In a statement, the countrys foreign ministry said: \"In implementing its policy on nuclear deterrence Russia is strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"\n\nPoland will build a razor-wire fence on its border with Russias Kaliningrad exclave, its defence minister said on Wednesday.

Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were \"known to be business associates\" of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list.\n\nUpdated at 12.06 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 11.07 EDT The US has information that indicates North Korea is secretly supplying Russia with artillery shells, according to the White House spokesperson, John Kirby. Kirby, who specialises in national security, told a virtual briefing that North Korea was trying to hide the shipments by funnelling them through the Middle East and North Africa. \"Our indications are that the DPRK is covertly supplying and we are going to monitor to see whether the shipments are received,\" Kirby said, according to Reuters, adding that Washington would consult with the United Nations on accountability issues over the shipments. \"It is not an insignificant number of shells, but we dont believe they are in such a quantity that they would change the momentum of the war,\" he said. \"And its certainly not going to change our calculus ... or with so many of our allies and partners about the kinds of capabilities were going to continue to provide the Ukrainians.\" North Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so, while warning the US to \"keep its mouth shut\" and stop circulating rumours aimed at \"tarnishing\" the countrys image.\n\nUpdated at 11.16 EDT\n\n2 Nov 2022 10.47 EDT Putin: Russia reserves right to withdraw from grain deal again if Kyiv breaks guarantees The Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken about the resumption of his nations participation in the Black Sea grain deal, saying Russia reserved the right to withdraw again if guarantees they had received were not kept. The Russian Interfax news agency quotes Putin saying: We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like [the Sevastopol attack] will happen in the future, that humanitarian corridors will not be used for military purposes. Information has been received through the Ministry of Defence from the Turkish side that such assurances have been given by Ukraine that these humanitarian corridors will not be used for military purposes. In this regard, I have given instructions to the Ministry of Defence to resume our full participation in this work. At the same time, Russia reserves the right to withdraw from these agreements if these guarantees are violated by Ukraine.

On Wednesday the New York Times reported that senior Russian military leaders had discussed when and how Moscow might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, according to multiple senior US officials. They said that the Biden administration was alarmed, as the news \"showed how frustrated Russian generals were about their failures on the ground, and suggests that Mr Putins veiled threats to use nuclear weapons might not just be words\".\n\nUpdated at 10.45 EDT",

They are moving very slowly,\" Ukraines presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nRussian control of Kherson\n\nOn February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, with his troops invading from four fronts.\n\nOn the southern front, Russian forces moved from the Crimea Peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, towards Odesa in the west, Zaporizhzhia in the north and Mariupol in the east.\n\nMoscow has ordered its forces to pull out from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson. On Wednesday, Russian officials said it was no longer feasible to continue reinforcements in the city. pic.twitter.com/QuVWSKaZPC AJ Labs (@ajlabs) November 10, 2022\n\nOn March 2, Russia said Kherson city was under its control. By March 15, it declared that the entire region had been taken.\n\nKherson is one of the four Ukrainian regions in which Russia staged \"referendums\" and formally \"annexed\" on September 30, a move that was condemned as illegal by Ukraine and its allies.\n\nUkraines counteroffensive\n\nRussias annexation moves came on the back of military setbacks in the northeast, where Ukrainian forces managed to recapture large swaths of territory. Simultaneously, on the southern axis, Ukraines forces also escalated their counteroffensive.\n\nBy October, Ukrainian forces had retaken more than 500sq km (193sq miles) of territory and dozens of settlements in the Kherson region, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nUkrainian forces were able to burst through Russias front lines, targeting Russian ground lines of communication, ammunition depots and military and transport assets. They also made several gains at key locations on the western bank of the Dnieper River, damaging two bridges and interfering with Russias efforts to sustain supplies via barge and ferry, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nThe strategic relevance of Kherson\n\nKherson region borders Crimea and establishes a land bridge between Russia and the peninsula on the Black Sea. If Ukraine can take back control, Russia would be deprived of that land bridge and it would bring Crimea within the reach of long-range Ukrainian artillery.\n\nThe region is also significant because it has access to fresh water that supplies the arid Crimea. Ukraine had cut off freshwater supply along a canal from the Dnieper River that had supplied 85 percent of the peninsulas needs following the annexation of Crimea. After Russia captured swaths of Kherson and Zaporizhia, it sought to unblock the canal.\n\nRetaking Kherson city, which had a pre-war population of some 280,000 people, would mean that Ukraine will be able to get back the largest urban centre that fell to Russian hands. Meanwhile, retaking the entire region would allow it to gain control of some of the coastline along the Black Sea, enabling the exportation of food to foreign markets, which has been severely disrupted during the conflict.",

                "cc_text": "The West cannot assume that the Russian leader will be a rational actor on nukes if he sees his nation and regime under existential threat.\n\nWhen, in early October, President Joe Biden remarked that the risk of nuclear \"Armageddon\" was now at its highest since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, he faced considerable skepticism and pushback. Yet senior U.S. officials appear to be taking the risk of an escalation involving nuclear weapons in Ukraine deadly seriously.\n\nLater that month, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin jumped on the phone to his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, and spoke with him twice in three days after Shoigu had claimed that Ukrainian forces planned to use a nuclear \"dirty bomb\" and blame it on Moscow. The reasons for the Pentagons concern were clear: Russian falsehoods about a dirty bomb could pave the way for potential nuclear use by Russia.\n\nAmerican military leaders are worried that Moscow is embarking on a dangerous path of nuclear escalation amid the painful and humiliating setbacks that Russian forces have suffered on the battlefield in Ukraine. The latest reversal for Russia, and a significant indication of the trouble its military is having holding the territory it captured in the early weeks of its invasion, is the withdrawal from the city of Kherson, which weeks ago it had declared part of Russia.\n\nTom Nichols: How should the U.S. respond to Putins nuclear provocation?\n\nWhat makes the situation so hazardous is President Vladimir Putins mercurial and impulsive decision making. From the start, the war in Ukraine has provided numerous examples of Putins emotional overreactions to events, and of his miscalculations. Putins move to annex Crimea in 2014 in response to revolution in Kyiv was one such decision, and it has given the peninsula a totemic significance in Russias war. Judging by his statements and conduct, the Russian leader appears to believe that the conflict he started has existential stakes for his country, his regime, and his rule, and that he cant afford to lose.\n\nSome people understandably prefer to believe that under no conditions would the Kremlin use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and that Russian nuclear saber-rattling can be dismissed. This is, in my view, a false assurance, but lets consider the arguments.\n\nEight months of war in Ukraine have provided plenty of examples of Moscow signaling red lines, then not following through on them. Back in March, Moscow issued a threat that it would target Western arms convoys entering Ukraine from NATO countries, to very little effect. In September, it declared that it would use all the means at its disposal to defend the four recently annexed Ukrainian regions. (When, days later, Ukrainian forces liberated the city of Lyman in one of those regions, Donetsk, Russia did not escalate matters.)\n\nOthers point to the Russian doctrine published in June 2020 that allows for the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear power only if the very existence of the Russian state is at risk. This vague definition, they argue, means that the Kremlin might use nukes if \"Russia proper\" is attacked but that Putin would not use them to defend territories that, in international law, are part of Ukraineincluding Crimea.\n\nThen there is the notion that Putin might be deterred from going nuclear by the negative reaction Russia could face from its remaining economic partnersmost notably, China, India, and Turkey. In addition, some analysts argue, the battleground efficacy of resorting to nuclear arms in Ukraine is questionable. Ukrainian forces have good mobility, which means that an attack on them with a tactical weapon, such as nuclear artillery, would require firing a lot of rounds that would have a dubious effect, and might also endanger Russian forces and the civilian population in Crimea and recently annexed territories.\n\nAnne Applebaum: Fear of nuclear war has warped the Wests Ukraine strategy\n\nSo far, also, Ukrainian leaders and the general population have downplayed the psychological impact that the use of nuclear weapons could have. Finally, there is the hope that American deterrence and messaging will influence the Kremlins calculus. If the U.S., as some retired American four-star generals have suggested, threatens to use overwhelming conventional force against Russian military assets in Ukraineincluding in Crimeaas a response to any nuclear attack, then Putin will back down.\n\nSo much for the case discounting any resort to nuclear weapons by Moscow. But given what we know about the Russian leader, no evidence suggests that he is prepared to vacate the illegally annexed territoriesespecially Crimea, which Putin sees as a defining aspect of his legacy. If Putin is unable to defend Crimea conventionally, then not to use all means at his disposal, including nuclear weapons, could lead to his being perceived in Moscow as weak; in Putins eyes at least, that could endanger his domestic political survival. The Kremlins equivocal messaging about its red lines, and its failure to enforce them, doesnt mean they dont exist.\n\nNeither should anyone set too much store by the ostensible restrictions in Russian nuclear doctrine. Despite them, as many senior Russian officials have pointed out, the doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory against conventional aggression. Furthermore, their vague language could give Putin plenty of room for maneuversomething seen in the serial instances on his watch in which Russian laws, including the constitution itself, have been bent or violated.\n\nFrom Moscows point of view, the illegally annexed territories now belong to Russia. Accordingly, losing them to an invading army would mean one thing: Russias nuclear arsenal is no deterrent to any potential aggressor. The way that senior Ukrainian officials have been framing the breakup of Russia as a desired outcome of the war is not helpfulserving only to confirm Putin in his long-held belief that the Wests goal in supporting Ukraine is regime change in Moscow and the destruction of his country.\n\nAs for the reaction of Russias major partners like China, the Kremlin knows full well that Beijing will not use its economic leverage to deter Russia. Xi Jinping might warn against nuclear war, but he wont threaten the Kremlin with breaking economic and military relations should Moscow use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Beijing knows it is unlikely to reap any reward from the U.S. for putting pressure on the Kremlin to fix a problem that China sees as American-made. India and Turkey have so far voiced concern about possible nuclear escalation in Ukraine only in vague terms, and have also refrained from suggesting that they might impose any real consequences should Russia indeed use weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Kremlin believes that the devastation inflicted by the Russian air bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure will be a rude awakening for President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, and make them more clear-eyed about Putins determination to fight by all means possibleincluding nuclear weapons, should that remain the only option for him to not lose this war. Russian leadership also still labors under the misperception that Ukraines leaders have no agency, and that Zelensky and his team are beholden to the U.S. If the White House wishes, the thinking goes, Ukrainian military advances can be stopped and Kyiv can be brought to the negotiating table.\n\nFinally, Russian leadership believes that no American president will risk a nuclear war with Russia over a non-NATO member, even Ukraine. The Kremlin believes that Biden understands this when he says that Putin \"is not joking.\" The Russians believe that any U.S. military response to a Russian nuclear escalation would most likely be conventional, such as U.S. strikes to destroy the Russian Black Sea fleet or other targets within Ukraines internationally recognized borders. But the Kremlin also believes that Washington may be inhibited even in this response, on the assumption that such actions would lead to further Russian escalation. Putin probably judges that U.S. nuclear deterrence in this context means a nuclear response only as a last resort.\n\nPutin also takes inspiration from his experience dealing with the U.S. in 2013, when President Barack Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a red line yet failed to act when the Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad crossed it. The White House preferred to reach a deal with the Kremlin rather than use military force. The calculation in Moscow is that something similar will happen this time around.\n\nWilliam Neuman: The nukes never went away\n\nNone of this provides any assurance that Putin will continue to exercise nuclear restraint. The bad news is that the military situation could deteriorate very quickly for the Kremlin, and then Putin, caught off guard by a series of setbacks from the front lines, might act impulsively. Worse, if a nuclear crisis should arise, the chances of successful diplomacy are slim. Putin does not seem to have abandoned his maximalist ambitions of subjugating Ukraine, and is likely to use any cease-fire the Kremlin would agree to as an opportunity to rebuild the Russian military machine and return to combat.\n\nFor his part, Zelensky is attuned to the dominant sentiment among Ukrainians, who are ready to fight to the bitter end after seeing the war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere. Ukraines war goals call for a return to the 1991 borders, including Crimea. Thats where Moscows and Kyivs red lines clash, with no chance now of reconciling them.\n\nThe good news is that, for now, the Western intelligence community has noted no changes in Russias nuclear posture. Putin appears convinced that the tools he is already using in Ukraine will ultimately work.\n\nThe mobilization that Moscow conducted in response to the Ukrainian counteroffensive in September has helped stabilize the front lines for the time being. The targeting of Ukrainian infrastructure that followed the explosion on the Crimea bridge a month ago is slowly but surely knocking out power stations and water supply across Ukraine, including in major population centers such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. This trend, the Kremlin hopes, will not only undermine the Ukrainian military advance but also force millions of civilians to abandon their homes in winter and seek refuge in other European countries, increasing the migration pressure on Ukraines allies.\n\nFinally, Russias energy war on Europe has not yet been as successful as the Kremlin had hoped, because of a relatively warm fall and the European Unions ability to fill gas storage. But Moscow knows that the coming winter will be more difficult for Europeans, when they will have to compete with the rest of the world for expensive liquified natural gas, given stopped Russian pipelines. Putin hopes that the combination of these factors will gradually erode Western support for Ukraine, and make it unnecessary for him to resort to the nuclear option.\n\nThat is obviously not the Wests desired outcome, so the U.S. needs to prepare for what Putin might do if this strategy stalls or fails. Addressing a nuclear escalation will require the U.S. to have a functioning communication channel with Russia. Although, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan recently revealed, these channels are not entirely moribund, no diplomatic progress on the nuclear issue has been visible.\n\nEven before Russias invasion of Ukraine, American and European leaders likened communication with their Kremlin counterparts to talking to a TV set tuned to a Russian propaganda station. And Moscow is still speaking from that script.",

The announcement followed news that Russia would withdraw troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nAccording to Nikolenko, the feeling is similar to that of 2014 and 2015, following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Despite statements coming from the Russian Federation indicating an openness to peace talks, Nikolenko sees Russia's actions as directly contrary to those ends.\n\n\"Those who are really interested in peace negotiations do not destroy cities and villages, do not kill civilians, do not destroy energy infrastructure, do not abuse the residents of temporarily occupied territories, do not interfere with food supplies,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly assured allies that it is still open to negotiations, under its own terms.\n\n\"Let me remind you that Ukraine has repeatedly offered negotiations,\" Nikolenko said. \"But we always received either a contemptuous reaction and a demand to obey the Kremlin's ultimatums, or another act of genocide against Ukrainians.\"\n\nRocio Fabbro",

With Moscow's invasion in its ninth month, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in a Nov. 2 letter requested four MQ-1C Gray Eagle unmanned aerial systems or drones, and in a separate document, asked for the first time for a counter-drone missile, according to a document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the request said. The drones, which cost about $10 million each, and the counter-drone AGM-114L or LONGBOW would bolster Ukraine's civilian air defenses and help counter Russia's growing use of Iranian-made kamikaze drones far from the front lines. The United States rejected Kyiv's prior request for the drones, concerned they could be shot down, were not essential to Ukraine's war effort and could escalate the conflict.",

The attacks have been methodical, seemingly planned with the expertise of technical specialists familiar with the vulnerabilities of Ukraine's electricity network, with the apparent aim of crippling the power system and causing widespread disruption (1,5).\n\nThe intensity of the missile strikes has fluctuated over time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that 85 strikes occurred on a single day, marking it as one of the largest waves of attacks since the campaign's intensification (2). According to a Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson, around 100 missiles hit multiple cities across Ukraine, targeting at least a dozen cities and districts, which aligns with independent analyses of the strikes (2,3,10). While a senior U.S. military official noted that the frequency of missile and drone strikes had decreased slightly since the end of October, the official emphasized that Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure, such as the electrical grid, were expected to continue unabated (7)."

Strategically, such expansions strain Ukrainian resources and necessitate international support, while also imposing significant costs on Russia, considering the expensive nature of missile systems and the potential strategic and psychological impacts of their use or loss (2,3).",
                "summary": "The Ukrainian military high command has indicated that Russian forces are fortifying positions in the Kherson region, suggesting a preparation for continued combat operations, which may hint at an expansion of their missile campaign within Ukraine (1). The strategic implications of such expansion are profound, as Russia's missile attacks have already targeted Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, causing significant damage and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment (4). Despite the extensive costs associated with missile expansion, both in acquisition and sustainment, as outlined by the Congressional Budget Office, Russia has demonstrated a willingness to incur these expenses, as evidenced by their continued missile strikes across Ukraine and their development of the new \"Satan-2\" missile (2,3). Moreover, the recent large-scale missile attack on Ukrainian cities underscores the likelihood of Russia's commitment to employing its missile arsenal to achieve strategic objectives, despite the international ramifications and the strain on its military resources (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The recent increase in missile attacks by Russia on Ukrainian cities suggests that there is a likelihood of further expansion of its missile campaign within Ukraine. On one occasion, Russia fired approximately \"around 100 missiles\" at various cities across the country, indicating a significant escalation and the largest wave of strikes since a previous increase in attacks on October 10, which targeted Ukraine's electricity, water, and gas infrastructure (5). The systematic nature of these attacks, which appear to be aimed at crippling Ukraine's power system and infrastructure, demonstrates Russia's capability and willingness to conduct extensive missile strikes that could potentially extend to other areas within Ukraine (8). Analysts have also noted the strategic use of missile strikes in attempts to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses, as evidenced by an attack on October 31 where Russia launched 55 missiles, although only 10 penetrated the defenses causing considerable damage to energy structures (4).\n\nThe strategic implications of such an expansion are multifaceted. Russia's missile campaign is already causing major problems for Ukraine, generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment, and leading to rationing of power to prevent a collapse of the electricity grid (4). The Russian missile strikes are strategically planned with the intent to damage Ukraine's high voltage networks and hinder the provision of heating and electricity to millions of consumers, which is already proving challenging for the Ukrainian transmission system operator, Ukrenergo (8). Moreover, the continuous missile attacks and the potential for further escalation raise concerns internationally, prompting discussions within NATO on the level of military assistance provided to Ukraine and the potential for stepped-up arms supplies as a deterrent to Russian aggression (7). The costs associated with expanding missile capabilities, such as the United States' projected costs for strategic delivery systems, suggest that similar actions by Russia would be very expensive, adding a significant financial dimension to the strategic implications (2)."

Ukrainian officials fear continued overwhelming attacks similar to those on October 31st, which, although only 10 out of 55 missiles penetrated defenses, resulted in substantial harm to the energy grid, prompting power rationing to prevent a total collapse (2). In response to the intensified targeting of civilian infrastructure by Russia, Ukraine has sought advanced air-defense systems from the United States to protect people and essential services, although earlier requests for drones were denied over concerns of escalation and their necessity in the war effort (4). President Zelensky reported that Ukraine has been hit by approximately 85 strikes, with the latest wave being one of the largest since Russia escalated its campaign against the country's utilities on October 10th (5).",
                "more_detailed": "On November 15th, Russian missile strikes caused significant damage to civilian areas in Ukraine, resulting in widespread disruption to critical infrastructure. In the capital city of Kyiv, 40% of residents were left without water, and power supply was cut to 270,000 homes, indicating a substantial impact on the civilian population's daily life (1). The attacks were part of a larger campaign that has seen at least 85 strikes launched on Ukraine, targeting not only Kyiv but also at least a dozen other cities and districts, damaging electricity, water, and gas infrastructure and leaving 7 million homes without supplies. The intensity of these strikes is reminiscent of the escalated campaign that began on October 10th and represents the largest wave of attacks since that date (5).\n\nThe consequences of the missile strikes extended beyond immediate material damage, with two agricultural workers killed by stray missiles feared to have exploded in Poland near the Ukraine border (7). Additionally, the attacks have had a regional effect, impacting power supply in neighboring Moldova (7). Human rights concerns have also been raised, with Amnesty International accusing Russia of war crimes and likely crimes against humanity for unlawfully transferring and deporting civilians from occupied parts of Ukraine (8). This pattern of targeting civilian infrastructure and populations underscores the broader strategy that has seen over a third of Ukraine's energy infrastructure destroyed and has led to a call for increased global support and pressure on Russia (4,10)."

These measures are particularly focused on urban areas and are designed as a short-term solution to conserve power, with Ukrenergo carrying out controlled power outages while facing ongoing attacks that have affected infrastructure across the nation, with the northern and central regions being hit hardest (1,3).\n\nMoreover, concerted efforts are underway to repair the damaged energy infrastructure with the assistance of equipment from 12 different countries, as indicated by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba (2). Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has mentioned that emergency power outages have begun in the capital, where significant portions of the population are facing not only electricity but also water shortages due to these strikes (2,4). Furthermore, the G7 has pledged to establish a coordination mechanism to aid Ukraine in repairing, restoring, and defending its critical energy and water infrastructure, demonstrating international support for Ukraine's civilian resilience (8)."

Additionally, India's concerns over the invasion set a precedent of insecurity for nations fearing aggression from neighboring countries, which could contribute to regional instability (4).

Additionally, the systematic destruction of Ukraine's electricity infrastructure demonstrates a calculated effort to weaken the country by depriving it of essential services, further exacerbating the crisis and potentially destabilizing neighboring countries through refugee flows and economic disruptions (7).\n\nThe conflict's escalation, including the potential for the use of nuclear weapons, has prompted global powers to reassess their defense and foreign policies. France, for instance, is adapting to the new reality of missile and drone threats, reflecting a broader European concern about security and the need for strategic autonomy (6). Simultaneously, concerns about grain exports being blocked by Russia highlight another dimension of the conflict's far-reaching consequences, affecting global food security and potentially inciting international unrest, especially in lower and middle-income countries that rely heavily on these supplies (5,10). The combination of military aggression and economic coercion through these missile attacks underscores the multifaceted implications for both regional and global stability."

                "cc_text": "Russian General Sergei Surovikin, commander of the joint group of troops, briefed the media that they had used the Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighters in combat in Ukraine. Only ten Su-57s have been produced till date. The first operational unit was formed in 2021. It is supposed to be a multi-role aircraft with significant air-to-air and ground attack capability. Earlier the aircraft were first reportedly used in the Syrian campaign in 2018. The news has brought into focus the capabilities and operational roles of these advanced stealth aircraft.\n\nThe Americans were the first to induct a fifth-generation aircraft, the F-22 Raptor, in 2005. They subsequently inducted three variants of F-35 Lightning II into their armed forces starting 2015. Nearly 850 of these have been built till October 2022 and delivered to 17 counties, including many NATO countries near Ukraine. China inducted the J-20 \"Mighty Dragon\" into service in 2017. Nearly 150 have been built, it is claimed. Chinas second fifth-generation fighter Shenyang FC-31 \"Gyrfalcon\" did its first flight in October 2012, but is still under development. The other fifth-generation fighters under development include Indias Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), Russias Sukhoi Su-75 \"Checkmate\", South Koreas KAI KF-21 \"Boramae\", and Turkeys TAI TF-X. The Mikoyan PAK DP, also referred to as MiG-41 is a Russian programme to develop a heavy stealth fighter to replace the Mikoyan MiG-31.\n\nAttributes of a fifth generation fighter\n\nMost current fighters around the world are fourth-generation with multirole configurations. These aircraft manoeuvres with fast transients involving quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction. Have high thrust-weight ratios, digital fly-by-wire (FBW) flight controls, Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) electronically manage power plants, Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars give multi-direction tracking and fire-control ability. Wide screen cockpit displays allow better situational awareness. Composite materials like bonded aluminium honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy laminate skins help reduce aircraft weight.\n\nA few low-observable front-aspect stealth technologies were used in aircraft that were termed as 4.5 generation fighters. Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Saab JAS 39 Gripen were in this category. The first real stealth designs were Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft in 1983 and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit in 1989.\n\nStarting with the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor, fifth-generation fighters were designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. The AESA radars with high-bandwidth low-probability of intercept, and IRST and other sensors are fused in for Situational Awareness (SA) and to constantly track all targets of interest around the aircrafts 360 degree bubble. In addition to its high resistance to ECM, they could function as a \"mini-AWACS\".\n\nIntegrated electronic warfare system, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI), centralised vehicle health monitoring, fibre-optic data transmission, and stealth are important features. Manoeuvre performance was enhanced by thrust-vectoring. Super-cruise was inbuilt. Signature-reduction techniques include special shaping approaches, thermoplastic materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors and weapons, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs and coating internal and external metal areas with radar-absorbent materials and paints. These aircraft are very expensive.\n\nSukhoi SU-57\n\nSukhoi SU-57 \"Felon\" is a fifth-generation fighter developed by the United Aircraft Corporation. Only 10 out of the 78 aircraft ordered have been inducted till date, and all are planned to be in by 2028.\n\nBy June 2022 Russia had reportedly deployed four Su-57s in the Ukraine conflict as a part of the tactical information network. They claim that the Felon \"has shown itself brilliantly\" in Ukraine, especially the on-board air-defence protection systems and the long-range precision air-to-air and ground offensive armament. The aircraft is well networked and pairs well with its \"loyal wingman\" the S-70 Okhotnik. The Su-57 is equipped with sophisticated sensor fusion, target detection, and communication capabilities.\n\nHowever, the West has been questioning the stealth capabilities especially due to poor wing-body blending, and consider it much inferior to the Western, and even Chinese, counterparts. Though the front aspect stealth is considered sufficient for the aircraft not to be detected by the US E-3 or E-8 AWACS when heading directly towards it.\n\nThe R-37M and K-77M missiles on the Su 57 have dual pulse motors and employ active homing AESA seekers for terminal guidance, and therefore difficult to break their lock. Su-57 also has a 245 kilometres range anti-radiation missile Kh-58UShKE, and 285-kilometer-range Kh-59MK2 Stealth Cruise Missile.\n\nIn the initial months of the Ukraine war, the Su-57 was not seen. Russian sources said that they were preserving the assets for possible escalation. Russian claims of Su-57s firing missiles at Ukrainian targets at stand-off distances are difficult to substantiate, says the West.\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-75 \"Checkmate\" is a single-engine, stealth, and light tactical aircraft under development. The first flight is planned in 2024 and induction in 2027.\n\nLockheed Martin F 22 Raptor\n\nThe F-22 first flew in 1997 and formally entered service in December 2005. The US Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component of its tactical airpower. The USAF had originally planned to buy 750 aircraft but in 2009, the program was cut to 187 operational aircraft due to high costs, and low employability for counterinsurgency operations. There was a ban on its exports due to sensitive technologies. More affordable and versatile F-35 was then evolved.\n\nF-22 fighter units were deployed at Kadena Air Base in Japan. They have done exercises in South Korea and Malaysia. In November 2007, F-22s from an airbase in Alaska intercepted two Russian Tu-95MS bombers.F-22s were deployed in the Middle East in 2007 at Al Dhafra in the UAE with Iran in mind. In March 2013, the USAF announced that an F-22 had intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that approached close to their MQ-1 Predator flying off the Iranian coastline.\n\nF-22s performed the first combat sorties with opening strikes of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American-led intervention in Syria flying a total of 204 sorties over Syria. Few F-22s were deployed in Germany, Poland and Estonia for NATO exercises. In November 2017, F-22s bombed opium production and storage facilities in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan. With cost per flight hour at $35,000, it is an expensive aircraft to operate and has been used restrictedly.\n\nLockheed Martin F35 Lightning II\n\nThe F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather, stealth, multirole, combat aircraft for both air superiority and strike missions. The three variants are the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) F-35A, the short take-off and vertical-landing (STOVL) F-35B, and the carrier-based (CV/CATOBAR) F-35C. Primarily funded by the United States, some close U.S. allies, like the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Italy, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and formerly Turkey also shared developmental funding. Several other countries placed, or are considering to place, orders.\n\nThe F-35 first flew in 2006 and entered service with the US Marine Corps F-35B in July 2015, followed by the US Air Force F-35A in August 2016 and the US Navy F-35C in February 2019. The aircraft was first used in combat in 2018 by the Israeli Air Force. The US plans to buy 2,456 F-35s through 2044 for the US Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The aircraft is planned to be a cornerstone of NATO and U.S.-allied air power until 2070. The aircraft are also operated by Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. Turkeys order was later cancelled due geo-political reasons. Nearly 850 have been built till date.\n\nChengdu J 20\n\nThe Chengdu J-20 \"Mighty Dragon\" is a twinjet all-weather stealth fighter aircraft designed as an air superiority fighter with precision strike capability. It made its maiden flight in January 2011, and was officially revealed at the 2016 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The aircraft entered service in March 2017. The first J-20 combat unit was formed in February 2018 and thus became the worlds third operational fifth-generation aircraft after the F-22 and F-35. Over 150 have reportedly been built.\n\nThe first interim engine was the Chinese Shenyang WS-10B. Aircraft finally entered production powered by theRussian Lyulka-Saturn AL-31FM2 engine with 145 kN thrust. There are reports that J-20B has the thrust vectoring WS-10C Chinese engine with thrust of 142-147 kN with serrated afterburner nozzles for enhanced rear-aspect stealth.The final intended power-plant is the Xian WS-15, with a thrust of 180 kN that will permit super-cruise. The same is still under development.\n\nThere have also been questions about J-20s stealth. Military analysts feel that though inferior to the American fighters, its stealth is superior to that of the Russian Su-57, and is being improved further. Three operational fighter brigades are currently equipped with nearly 90 aircraft. The aircraft is nearly double the size of Rafale in volume. It can externally carry up to 11,000 kg. To remain stealth, it can carry six conformal missiles that include the Long Range PL-15 and Very Long RangePL-21 AAM.\n\nIndias AMCA\n\nIndias fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) will be stealth, multirole, single-seat, twin-engine, air superiority fighter with ground-strike, Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) and Electronic Warfare (EW) missions. Designed by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), it will be built by a public-private joint venture between ADA, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), and an Indian private company. The development cost is estimated to be around Rs 15,000 crore (approx. $2 billion). The development of AMCA will take place in two phases, AMCA Mk-1 and AMCA Mk-2 which would majorly differ in the indigenous content and futuristic features. Mk-2 will focus more on stealth, EW, and futuristic pilot-AI interface. The AMCA Mk-2 will have DEWs and thrust-vectored engines with serrated nose pattern. Mk-2 will also incorporate sixth generation technologies. The aircraft will one day replace the Sukhoi Su-30MKI. The AMCA design is optimised for low radar cross section and super-cruise capability.Preliminary Design Review (PDR) has been completed. The Critical Design Review (CDR) is planned to be completed by the end 2022. The aircraft roll-out is planned in 2024 and the first flight in 2025. The approval from Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) was initiated in March 2022 and the same is expected shortly. The physical metal cutting will start thereafter. Most parts of the airframe are being made in India. Some systems like aero-engine are still imported. There are some other avionics and airborne radars that are being made through joint-ventures with friendly foreign companies. The weapons are mostly being made in India. Sixth generation technologies are on drawing boards. It can be seen that India has finally come of age in its fighter aircraft manufacturing eco-system. The aircraft, along with its naval variant, is intended to provide the bulk of the manned tactical airpower of the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy over the coming decades.\n\nOther Fifth Generation Fighter Programmes\n\nTAI TF-X is a Turkish fifth-generation fighter program initiated by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) in 2011. Initially Swedens Saab AB was to provide design support services. In 2015 it was decided that the programme will be entirely indigenous. The TAI CEO TemelKotil stated that the TF-X will be unveiled in 2023, and make its first flight by 2025. The fighter is planned to enter service in 2029.\n\nThe Flygsystem 2020 (Flight System 2020) is an ongoing fifth-generation, low-observable, project by Sweden to develop the fighter jet by 2035 to replace the JAS 39 multirole fighters. There is also a proposal for Sweden to join the British BAE Systems Tempest stealth sixth-generation fighter program and integrate some technologies of the Flygsystem 2020 program.\n\nJapan developed a prototype of a stealth jet fighter called the Mitsubishi X-2 Shinshin. The first prototype rolled out in July 2014 and the aircraft made its first flight on 22 April 2016. By July 2018, Japan had gleaned sufficient information, and decided that it would need to bring on international partners to complete this project. Japan has also signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop a sixth-generation fighter called Mitsubishi F-X.\n\nTechnology Roadmap India\n\nBreakthrough disruptive technologies keep changing the status quo. High-bandwidth high-speed networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing, robotics, are going to change the way air war is fought. Keeping abreast with new technologies is important. The aerial platforms must be built around modularity that will ease regular upgrades. Smart structures and hybrid systems will dictate the future. Demand for streaming high-quality data requires bandwidth, which involves innovating sensor/processing systems. Network-centric payload processing units enable on-board data fusion prior to sending to digital links. Gallium Nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor material that is more efficient, easier to cool, and improves reliability for radars. The Passive Aero-elastic Tailored (PAT), a uniquely designed composite wing, will be lighter, more structurally efficient. It will reduce weight and conserve fuel. Hypersonic cruise, fuel cell technologies, hybrid sensors, improved human-machine interface using data analytics and biomimicry, combination of materials, apertures and radio frequencies that ensure survival in enemy territory are under development.\n\nThings will be built faster, better and more affordably, using 3D printing yet ensuring quality and safety standards. Additive 3D manufacture creates a world with spare parts on demand, faster maintenance and repairs, more effective electronics, and customised weapons. The development of a hypersonic aircraft would forever change the ability to respond to conflict. Nano-materials will control sizes, shapes and compositions, and significantly reduce weight yet create stronger structures for air and spacecraft, and simultaneously drive down costs.\n\nWay Ahead for India: AMCA Must Succeed\n\nThe escalating cost of modern fighters, coupled with national priorities, budgetary constraints, human-resource crunch, newer battlefield challenges, leads one to conclude that a new way of war-fighting would need to be employed, especially in the aerospace domain. Future aerial platforms will have to penetrate a dense integrated AD environment that is backed by electronic and cyber-attacks. Armed forces need to prepare for asymmetric warfare. Air forces will have to engage in system-of-systems approach to take on multi-dimension, multi-domain operations.\n\nUndoubtedly, the \"aatmanirbharta\" campaign will drive indigenisation. For India to be part of the big league, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) must succeed. The aircraft needs to be developed concurrently with LCA Mk2 and must have a dedicated separate team. A \"whole of nation\" vision and approach will be required. Spelling out clear end-states, timelines and regular path-line reviews would be important. The time to act is now, lest it is too late.\n\nThe writer is Director General, Centre for Air Power Studies.

                "cc_text": "Known loosely as the Mariupol plan, after the strategically vital port city, it called for the creation of an autonomous republic in Ukraines east, giving Putin effective control of the countrys industrial heartland, where Kremlin-armed, -funded and -directed \"separatists\" were waging a two-year-old shadow war that had left nearly 10,000 dead. The new republics leader would be none other than Yanukovych. The trade-off: \"peace\" for a broken and subservient Ukraine.\n\nThe scheme cut against decades of American policy promoting a free and united Ukraine, and a President Clinton would no doubt maintain, or perhaps even harden, that stance. But Trump was already suggesting that he would upend the diplomatic status quo; if elected, Kilimnik believed, Trump could help make the Mariupol plan a reality. First, though, he would have to win, an unlikely proposition at best. Which brought the men to the second prong of their agenda that evening internal campaign polling data tracing a path through battleground states to victory. Manaforts sharing of that information the \"eyes only\" code guiding Trumps strategy would have been unremarkable if not for one important piece of Kilimniks biography: He was not simply a colleague; he was, U.S. officials would later assert, a Russian agent.\n\nTheir business concluded, the men left by separate routes to avoid detection, though they continued to text deep into the night, according to federal investigators. In the weeks that followed, operatives in Moscow and St. Petersburg would intensify their hacking and disinformation campaign to damage Clinton and help turn the election toward Trump, which would form the core of the scandal known as Russiagate. The Mariupol plan would become a footnote, all but forgotten. But what the plan offered on paper is essentially what Putin on the dangerous defensive after a raft of strategic miscalculations and mounting battlefield losses is now trying to seize through sham referendums and illegal annexation. And Mariupol is shorthand for the horrors of his war, an occupied city in ruins after months of siege, its hulking steelworks spectral and silenced, countless citizens buried in mass graves.\n\nPutins assault on Ukraine and his attack on American democracy have until now been treated largely as two distinct story lines. Across the intervening years, Russias election meddling has been viewed essentially as a closed chapter in Americas political history a perilous moment in which a foreign leader sought to set the United States against itself by exploiting and exacerbating its political divides.\n\nYet those two narratives came together that summer night at the Grand Havana Room. And the lesson of that meeting is that Putins American adventure might be best understood as advance payment for a geopolitical grail closer to home: a vassal Ukrainian state. Thrumming beneath the whole election saga was another story about Ukraines efforts to establish a modern democracy and, as a result, its position as a hot zone of the new Cold War between Russia and the West, autocracy and democracy. To a remarkable degree, the long struggle for Ukraine was a bass note to the upheavals and scandals of the Trump years, from the earliest days of the 2016 campaign and then the presidential transition, through Trumps first impeachment and into the final days of the 2020 election. Even now, some influential voices in American politics, mostly but not entirely on the right, are suggesting that Ukraine make concessions of sovereignty similar to those contained in Kilimniks plan, which the nations leaders categorically reject.",

                "cc_text": "When Russia's defence minister appeared on state media to report that he had ordered a withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River, including from the city of Kherson situated on the east bank, the news was immediately hailed by the western media as a great victory for the Ukrainian army.\n\nThis jubilation was something everyone could understand. Kherson was the only major Ukrainian regional capital city to be occupied by the Russians since the start of the war last February. Recapturing it and pushing the Russians out of the west bank of the river would therefore have immense symbolic and logistical value for Ukraine.\n\nIt would also be a colossal setback for Russia, which needs the area to secure a water supply to Crimea. For those reasons, they had every incentive to defend it.\n\nFor Vladimir Putin, the loss of Kherson was obviously a most embarrassing setback. He had presided over a ridiculously ostentatious ceremony in the Kremlin, striking the studied pose of a nineteenth century Tsar to celebrate the annexation of Kherson and the other three oblasts.\n\nHe was televised signing a document that proclaimed the newly conquered territories were now an inalienable part of the Russian Federation. And he declared to the whole world that: \"We will defend our land with all the powers and means at our disposal.\"\n\nNow, only a few weeks later, he is publicly humiliated by the surrender of Kherson. What better news could there be for the Kyiv government and its western backers? One might have expected an explosion of popular joy and euphoria, accompanied by the sound of trumpets and drums, military parades and defiant speeches from Zelensky announcing new, even more spectacular advances and the imminent defeat of Russia.\n\nInstead, to the worlds astonishment, Zelensky warned against an excessively triumphant interpretation of this development, which he said may be only a move to regroup forces. In the immortal words of Alice in Wonderland, curiouser and curiouser.\n\nHow is it possible to make sense of all this?\n\nTo start with, in this life, not everything is as it seems to be. It is one thing for Putin to make grandiose declarations in the Kremlin, or for Zelensky to make stirring speeches to the adoring dignitaries of foreign parliaments.\n\nBut the practical conduct of the war is in the hands of local commanders, whose most pressing need is to deal with the realities of the situation on the ground and to take the appropriate decisions.\n\nThe Ukraine war is a reflection of the inherent weakness of a bourgeois Bonapartist regime. One can say that, so far, on the Russian side, it has been a war in which political factors have played a far greater role than purely military ones.\n\nFrom the beginning, the driving force has been, on the one hand, NATOs aggressive push towards Russias borders, on the other, the exaggerated ambitions of Vladimir Putin and his desire to enhance his personal prestige and his grip on power, which is closely related to it.\n\nThe desire to confront the aggressive expansion of NATO that is, fundamentally, US imperialism is an aim that can be understood and enjoys widespread support amongst the Russian people, in particular, the working class.\n\nBut the Bonapartist nature of the regime stands in the way of a successful military campaign. Putins personal interference in military decisions played a negative role from the beginning, when he clearly underestimated the dimensions of the problem that he had set out to resolve by the only means he knows violent force.\n\nPutin is the product of capitalist restoration in Russia. He poses as a strong man but in reality, he is the creature of a corrupt and rapacious class of oligarchs who have enriched themselves through the massive theft of state property, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nCorruption is rife in such a system. It is built into its DNA and is its heart and soul. It penetrates all layers of society, from the very top to the bottom. And since any army is only the mirror image of the society that created it, the same corruption will be found there also.\n\nIt is impossible to have an accurate idea of the scale of corruption, robbery, theft, nepotism, favouritism, bullying, bungling and inefficiency that exists in Russias army. There can be little doubt that such factors as these have played a significant role in the failures of the Russian army in the Ukrainian campaign.\n\nA series of embarrassing reversals highlighted serious weaknesses on the Russian side. It has also damaged the personal prestige of Vladimir Putin potentially a serious problem for the \"Strong Man\" in the Kremlin.\n\nIt was this that finally persuaded him that it was necessary to take a step back and leave important tactical issues related to the running of the war more in the hands of commanders of proven worth who are in direct contact with the realities of the battlefield.\n\nThis, together with the long-delayed order to mobilise new forces for the front, might represent a significant change for the better in Russias fortunes.\n\nGeneral Surovikin\n\nEnter General Sergei Surovikin, who was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine on 8 October after the terrorist attack that damaged a strategically important bridge that connected Russia to Crimea. He has been given a bad press in the West, which portrays him as a ruthless man with a reputation for brutality and for bombing civilians in Russias campaign in Syria.\n\nGeneral Surovikin was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine on 8 October / Image: Vitaliy Pikov\n\nThey conveniently forget the brutal American bombing that reduced Mosul to a pile of smoking rubble. They also forget to add that Surovikins Syria campaign was also highly successful. That fact, and not any moral considerations, explains their extreme dislike of the man.\n\nIt is necessary to approach war in its own terms, just as one must approach art, science, or any other subject in its own terms, since what is applicable and appropriate for one is wholly inapplicable and inappropriate to another.\n\nHumanitarianism and the desire to prevent human suffering are, of course, highly praiseworthy. These values are very important, for example, for nursing. But a heavyweight boxer who placed such considerations high on his list of priorities would not win many fights.\n\nBy the same token, a general whose main interest was in saving lives would not win many wars, since wars are, by definition, about killing people. Sad to say, it is precisely the most ruthless generals who are likely to win battles. And we must judge Surovikin, just as we would judge a professional in any other field: solely by the results he achieves.\n\nObviously, the Russian decision to withdraw its troops to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River was of considerable propaganda value for Ukraine and its western backers. But wars are not won or lost on the basis of propaganda. And from a military point of view, it actually made perfectly good sense for the Russians to do just what they have done.\n\nThe western media have made a lot of noise to the effect that the delivery of modern \"smart\" weapons to Ukraine represent a \"game-changer\". That is an exaggeration. HIMARS and other advanced weapons systems in and of themselves are not enough to tip the overall balance of forces.\n\nNevertheless, they were sufficient to create a lot of problems in the Russian rear, weakening their supply lines. In particular, the supply of advanced artillery pieces to the Ukrainians by the west before the summer allowed them to destroy the bridges over the Dnipro and created serious difficulties for keeping the defenders of Kherson supplied with food and ammunition.\n\nThe Ukrainians were advancing on two fronts towards Kherson, threatening to surround the city and effectively cut off its garrison, which would be faced with the alternative of surrendering or being cut to pieces. That indeed would have represented a major defeat for Russia.\n\nFaced with that possibility, Surovikin decided that it was best to preserve the Russian forces and equipment by withdrawing to the east bank of the river, which forms a natural defensive line.\n\nThe fall of Kherson was not achieved by a heroic assault by the Ukrainian army. Indeed, battlefield reports from the BBC on Ukraines side of the Kherson frontline indicated that Kyivs forces might still lack the necessary equipment to achieve that aim.\n\nSo, when reports began to circulate that the Russian forces would probably leave the city and withdraw to the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, they were not taken seriously.\n\nIn fact, the first reaction was incredulity. Was this just a trick? Are they trying to lure us into an ambush? The spokesperson for Ukraines southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, described it as a ruse to draw Ukraine into battle.\n\nEven so, it seems hard to explain the extraordinary degree of caution with which the news of the Russian withdrawal has been met on the Ukrainian side. And there are other things that are even harder to explain.\n\nWhy was there hardly any fighting around Kherson? Why was the capital city taken with hardly a shot being fired? More importantly, why were the withdrawing Russian forces not subjected to a merciless bombardment?\n\nTens of thousands of Russian troops crossing across the Dnipro through a small number of pontoon bridges would have been like sitting ducks for Ukrainian artillery and drones. Yet the withdrawal was carried out in good order and seemingly without significant loss of life.\n\nWas there a deal?\n\nNow the Ukrainians are belatedly trying their best to make this sound like a great victory. But reading between the lines (which one always had to do in this war), it is becoming clearer that the situation was not all that it seemed to be.\n\nGeneral Surovikin took one look at the map and immediately grasped the fact that, once the bridges across the Dnipro were down, the only real possibility open to him was to withdraw / Image: War Mapper\n\nThere are only two alternatives. Either the Ukrainian commanders are deaf, blind, dumb and very stupid (which we do not believe). Or else they had reached some kind of deal with the Russians. They would be allowed to take the city of Kherson without a bloody battle, on condition that they allowed the Russians free passage to the eastern shore with the bulk of their forces intact.\n\nSuch a suggestion may seem to come straight out of the cyberworld of the craziest conspiracy theories. But any student of military history will know that it has plenty of historical antecedents.\n\nIn the 18th century, there was no such thing as standing armies or conscription. The armies of the absolute monarchs of Europe were largely made up of mercenaries, recruited from different countries who fought for their pay. That meant that wars were a very expensive business.\n\nIn order to reduce the losses caused by deaths that all too often occur on battlefields, they invented the most ingenious schemes. On the eve of a battle, the two opposing generals would meet like proper gentlemen and discuss the disposition of their armies.\n\nFollowing the accepted rules of warfare, as one would study a chess board, they would conclude that one side clearly had the advantage and therefore would be entitled to declare victory. The other side would gracefully concur and the whole matter would be settled amicably, without the expense and unpleasantness of fighting.\n\nThese methods were finally shattered by the French Revolution, which fought wars by revolutionary means, mobilising the entire male population through what was called the Leve en masse (mass levy).\n\nThe mass of raw soldiers went into battle without any of the necessary military training, but fired by the ideals of the Revolution. These bare-footed sans-culottes threw themselves against the professional soldiers with no fear of losing their lives. The armies of Austria and Prussia had never seen anything like it and fled in terror. Such is the power of the revolutionary people.\n\nThe French Revolution changed the face of Europe in many ways. It also changed the nature of war itself. Beginning with Prussia, every European state was compelled to introduce conscription, following the French example, but of course, without any of its revolutionary content. The new way of war was seen in all its bloody reality in two world wars. But the Kherson business suggests that the old ways of the 18th century have not died out altogether\n\nGeneral Surovikin took one look at the map and immediately grasped the fact that, once the bridges across the Dnipro were down, the only real possibility open to him was to withdraw from a place that could not be supplied and retreat to the safety of the east bank.\n\nThe successful movement of several thousand Russian troops across the Dnipro without significant loss of life or equipment provides powerful confirmation to the Russian version that the withdrawal from Kherson city was a tactical manoeuvre, aimed at avoiding a catastrophic defeat.\n\nThis decision was forced upon them by the unfavourable circumstances already commented on. But it is the duty of a commander in the field to take account of such changes and act accordingly, which is what Surovikin did. There was absolutely nothing reprehensible about it from a strictly military point of view.\n\nThe complaints from the ultra-nationalist wing in Moscow merely show how far removed these gentlemen are from the realities of war. Even more ridiculous were the statements made by Medvedev and others to the effect that \"nothing has changed\" and Kherson remains within Russia.\n\nThat is clearly false. From the point of view of the Russian campaign, the value of the bridgehead on the west bank of the Dnipro was mainly as an advance position for an offensive on Mykolayiv and Odessa. Those plans have now been abandoned for the foreseeable future and any attempt to cross the river again will be much more difficult.\n\nPutin showed more sense than the others when he simply kept silent and slid quietly into the shadows, on the very sound principle that it is better to keep your mouth shut and let people think you are a fool than open it and let them know you are a fool.\n\nIn any case, the loss of Kherson is far from the end of the story and even if it causes some embarrassment to Putin, it will not do him any lasting damage.\n\nThe west is constantly harping on the theme of the imminent overthrow of Putin. But most people in Russia especially the working class believe (correctly) that this is a war of Russia against NATO and their hatred of US imperialism far outweighs any other consideration.\n\nThey will therefore continue to support Russias war and to tolerate Putins leadership until that becomes absolutely untenable. But that moment has not yet arrived.\n\nWhat has been achieved?\n\nThe question has to be asked: what has been achieved by the Russian withdrawal from Kherson? The Ukrainian army has been left in control of a largely deserted city, presumably full of mines and booby traps, while the Russian forces, by withdrawing to the other side of the Dnipro, have placed themselves in a strong defensive position.\n\nThe river Dnipro is itself a formidable barrier, which bars the eastward thrust of the Ukrainian forces. The surrounding area is mostly open ground with little or no cover for advancing troops to shelter from enemy fire. And the Russians have had plenty of time to fortify the eastern bank with concrete bunkers.\n\nThis means that the Ukrainians now have no realistic prospect of any further advance on the southern front. True, having come up to the Dnipro means that the supply lines into Crimea are now within the range of their artillery in the west bank. And true, they now have more troops which can be deployed elsewhere on the front line. There are reports that they are moving them to the Zaporizhzhia front where they might attempt to cut the Russian land corridor. It is impossible to verify these reports. But the Russians will also now have more troops free to defend the front wherever necessary.\n\nThe numbers of Russian soldiers mobilised continues to grow, and as winter grows closer, the frozen ground will make it possible to move their tanks into action. There is talk of a Russian winter offensive, which may not materialise. But it cannot be excluded.\n\nMeanwhile, constant air bombardment is destroying the Ukrainian infrastructure to the point that there is even talk of evacuating major cities including Kiev which the constant degradation of the infrastructure threatens to render uninhabitable.\n\nWashingtons response\n\nThe reality of the situation is not lost on serious military strategists in Washington. Speaking at an event at The Economic Club of New York, Joint Chiefs Chair general Mark Milley commented on the withdrawal of up to 30,000 Russian troops from the west bank of the Dnipro:\n\n\"I believe theyre doing it in order to preserve their force, to re-establish defensive lines south of the river, but that remains to be seen.\"\n\nBut Milley emphasised something else. He insisted that:\n\n\"[T]here may be a chance to negotiate an end to the conflict if and when the front lines stabilise during winter. When theres an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it. Seize the moment.\"\n\nThe generals enthusiasm for negotiations is no accident. It arises from his sober-minded appraisal of the real balance of forces:\n\n\"There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably in the true sense of the word may be not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Mark Milley's enthusiasm for negotiations is no accident. It arises from his sober-minded appraisal of the real balance of forces / Image: U.S. Secretary of Defense\n\nThis is the authentic voice of US imperialism. And this, not the rhetorical declarations of Zelensky, is what ultimately determines the fate of Ukraine.\n\nIn an even more significant development, The Wall Street Journal revealed that the Biden administration has refused to give Ukraine advanced drones that could target positions inside Russia.\n\nThe decision deprives Ukraine of the kind of advanced weaponry Kyiv has been requesting for months. Despite pleas from Kyiv and a bipartisan group of members of Congress, the Pentagon declined the request to provide the Gray Eagle MQ-1C drones which could negatively affect the extensive use by Russia of Iranian drones.\n\nThis was a clear reflection of the limit of the kinds of weaponry Washington is willing to provide for Ukraines defence. It was intended to send a signal to Moscow that the U.S. was unwilling to provide weapons that could escalate the conflict, creating the potential for a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO.\n\nIt was also a warning to Zelensky that there were definite limits to the willingness of the US to continue to foot the bill for a ruinously expensive war with no clear end in sight.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the Ukrainian President appealed for continued bipartisan support following the midterm elections. He is clearly a worried man and his worries are well founded.\n\n\"Politics by other means\"\n\nClausewitz pointed out long ago that war is only the continuation of politics by other means. The present war will end when the political ends of the key players are satisfied or when one or both sides are exhausted and lose the will to continue fighting.\n\nZelensky will, he says, settle for nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian army / Image: (C) Ukraine Presidency/Ukraine Presi/Planet Pix via ZUMA Press Wire\n\nWhat are these goals? The war aims of Zelensky are no secret. He will, he says, settle for nothing less than the complete expulsion of the Russian army from all Ukrainian lands including Crimea. He has said he will refuse to negotiate with Vladimir Putin. He even signed a decree specifying that Ukraine would only negotiate with a Russian president who has succeeded Putin. But that assumes rather optimistically that there is someone else he could negotiate with.\n\nThis standpoint is enthusiastically supported by the hawks in the western coalition: the Poles, the leaders of the Baltic States, who have their own interests in mind, and, of course, the wooden-headed chauvinists and warmongers in London, who imagine that Britain, even in its present state of economic, political and moral bankruptcy, is still an imperial power.\n\nThese deranged ladies and gentlemen are pushing the Ukrainians to go further much further than the Americans would like. Their most ardent desire is to see the Ukrainian army driving the Russians, not just from Donbas, but also Crimea, provoking the overthrow of Putin and the total defeat and (though they do not often speak of this in public) the complete dismemberment of the Russian Federation.\n\nBut the more sober-minded strategists of US imperialism know that all this delirium is just so much hot air, like the bullfrog in Aesops fable, who blew himself up to the point where he simply exploded. It is the stuff of dreams and has absolutely nothing in common with the real world.\n\nAlthough they make a lot of noise, no serious person pays the slightest attention to the antics of the politicians in London, Warsaw and Vilnius. As leaders of pygmy states that lack any real weight in the scales of international politics, they remain second-rate actors who can never play more than a minor supporting role in this great drama.\n\nIn fact, all the noise they make is merely an annoying distraction for US imperialism, for it is the USA that pays the bills and dictates everything that happens.\n\nThe war aims of US imperialism\n\nIn reality, the war aims of Washington do not coincide with those of the men in Kyiv, who long ago surrendered their so-called national sovereignty to their Boss on the other side of the Atlantic, and who no longer decide anything.\n\nThe goal of US imperialism is very simple: to weaken Russia / Image: NATO\n\nThe goal of US imperialism is not and never has been to defend a single inch of Ukrainian territory or help the Ukrainians win a war or in any other way.\n\nTheir real aim is very simple: to weaken Russia militarily and economically; to bleed it dry and to inflict harm on it; to kill its soldiers and ruin its economy, so that Russia will no longer offer any resistance to American domination of Europe and the world.\n\nIt was this aim that induced them to push the Ukrainians into an entirely unnecessary conflict with Russia over NATO membership. Having achieved this aim, they sat back and watched the spectacle of the two sides slugging it out, at a safe distance of several thousand miles.\n\nThey are entirely indifferent to the sufferings of the people of Ukraine, who they regard as mere pawns on the local chessboard of their power struggle with Russia. And it must be noted that, up to the present day, Ukraine has not been admitted to NATO membership, which was supposed to be the central business in the whole affair.\n\nThis is no accident. The present conflict suits Americas interests in many ways. They have the luxury of embroiling their enemy in a war in which no American soldiers are involved (at least, in theory), and all the fighting and dying is obligingly carried out by others.\n\nIf Ukraine was a member of NATO, this would mean that American combat troops would end up in a European war, fighting the Russian army, which possesses nuclear weapons. No. Far better to leave things as they are.\n\nWhen Zelensky complains that his western allies are not sending him all the arms he needs to win the war, he is not wrong. The Americans are sending him just enough arms to keep the war going, but not enough to score anything that resembles a decisive victory that could escalate into a direct conflict between Russia and NATO. But this is completely in line with Americas war aims.\n\nSanctions have failed\n\nOne important factor is the effects of the war on the world economy and the threat to social and political stability in the west that derives from it.\n\nThe sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine have been a spectacular failure. In fact, the value of Russian exports actually grew since the start of the war.\n\nAlthough the volume of Russias imports plunged as a result of sanctions, a number of countries have increased their trade with Russia. According to a detailed study by The New York Times imports from Turkey have increased by 113 percent, and Chinese imports by 24 percent.\n\nThe volume of trade with Russia after the start of the war was as follows:\n\nBritain: -76%\n\nSweden: -76%\n\nUSA: -35%\n\nGermany: -3%\n\nJapan: +13%\n\nSouth Korea: +17%\n\nNetherlands: +32%\n\nSpain: +57%\n\nChina: +64%\n\nBelgium: +81%\n\nBrazil: +106%\n\nTurkey: +198%\n\nIndia: + 310%\n\nMoreover, the high prices of oil and gas have offset revenue that Russia lost to sanctions. India and China have been buying much more of its crude, albeit at a discounted rate.\n\nThus, the lost income resulting from sanctions has been compensated by the rising price of oil and gas on world markets. Vladimir Putin continues to finance his armies with the proceeds, while the West is faced with the prospect of a freezing winter with soaring energy bills and rising public anger.\n\nSupport weakening\n\nThe question is: which side will tire of the war first? It is clear that time is not on the side of Ukraine, either from a military or a political point of view. And in the final analysis, the latter will weigh most heavily in the scales.\n\nWashington has been putting pressure on Zelensky to negotiate with Putin / Image: U.S. Department of State\n\nAs winter sets in and Europe is hit by a serious shortage of gas and electricity, public support for the war in Ukraine will weaken.\n\nNor can US support be taken for granted. In public, the Americans are keeping up the idea of their unshakable support for Ukraine, but in private, they are not at all convinced about the outcome.\n\nBehind the scenes, Washington has been putting pressure on Zelensky to negotiate with Putin. That was shown by Blinkens surprise visit to Kyiv in September and the more recent visit by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in November. But the strategists of US imperialism are very unsure how to proceed.\n\nThe Americans saw the Ukrainian advances on the battlefield (won mainly as a result of the active involvement of US imperialism) merely as a bargaining chip, designed to give the Ukrainians greater leverage at the negotiating table.\n\nIn practice, however, the successful Kharkiv offensive and the Russian withdrawal from Kherson has complicated the state of play on the diplomatic chess board. On the one hand, Zelensky and his generals were puffed up with their unexpected gains and wished to go much further.\n\nOn the other hand, the military setbacks represented a humiliating blow for Putin, who has drawn the conclusion that he needs to step up his \"special military operation\". Thus, neither side is in a mood to negotiate anything meaningful at present. But that will change.\n\nZelenskys demagogy, constantly insisting that they will never give up an inch of land, is clearly designed to put pressure on NATO and US imperialism by showing that the Ukrainians will fight to the end, always on condition that the West continues to send huge amounts of money and arms.\n\nBut the polls show that public support for the war in Ukraine is rapidly evaporating, as the New York Times already pointed out on 19 May 2022:\n\n\"Americans have been galvanized by Ukraines suffering, but popular support for a war far from U.S. shores will not continue indefinitely. Inflation is a much bigger issue for American voters than Ukraine, and the disruptions to global food and energy markets are likely to intensify.\" () \"But as the war continues, Mr. Biden should also make clear to President Volodymyr Zelensky and his people that there is a limit to how far the United States and NATO will go to confront Russia, and limits to the arms, money and political support they can muster.\"\n\nAnd as Business Insider reported on 27 September 2022:\n\n\"A new poll suggests that many Americans are growing weary as the US government continues its support of Ukraine in its war with Russia and want to see diplomatic efforts to end the war if aid is to continue. \"According to a poll conducted by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and Data for Progress, 57% of likely voters strongly or somewhat support the US pursuing diplomatic negotiations as soon as possible to end the war in Ukraine, even if it requires Ukraine making compromises with Russia.\"\n\nNuclear war?\n\nBiden would like to prolong the present conflict in order to weaken and undermine Russia. But not at any price, and certainly not if that involves a direct military clash with Russia.\n\nSpeaking about Putin, Biden invoked the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 / Image: James Vaughan Flickr\n\nPutins hint that he might consider using nuclear weapons was almost certainly a bluff, but it caused alarm in the White House. Speaking at a fundraiser in New York, Biden said Russias president was \"not joking\" about the \"potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming\".\n\n\"We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since [President John] Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,\" Biden said, adding that \"we have a direct threat of the use of nuclear weapons if in fact things continue down the path they are going\".\n\nThe Financial Times understands that secret negotiations are taking place between Washington and Moscow:\n\n\"President Joe Bidens sobering remarks about the threat of the use of nuclear weapons show that the White House is clear-eyed about the risk of escalation. For understandable reasons, Washington wants to maintain strategic ambiguity in public while communicating its views to the Kremlin in private. \"However, attempts to use a combination of new sanctions, more diplomatic isolation and possibly conventional NATO strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine to deter a desperate Putin from using weapons of mass destruction, should he feel cornered, are by no means guaranteed to succeed. To improve the chances of preventing a showdown, the quiet groundwork for crisis diplomacy should be laid now.\"\n\nDespite all the noise about Putin planning to use nuclear weapons, there are no credible reports to suggest that this is the case. He has no need for such weapons. On the Russian side, this is evidently a bluff (and one that has had some effect).\n\nBut the Russians have accused the Ukrainians of preparing to use a \"dirty bomb\", that is, conventional explosives laced with radioactive material.\n\nThis may be true or just part of the propaganda war. But it is very clear that the Ukrainian side is getting increasingly desperate and looking for any excuse to stage a provocation that they hope will finally drag NATO into direct participation in the war. It is not at all excluded that the Russian claim may be true.\n\nThis underlines the dangers that are implicit if the war is allowed to continue. There are too many uncontrollable elements in play, which might give rise to the kind of downward spiral that could lead to a real war between NATO and Russia.\n\nIn the event of a general European conflagration, it would be impossible for the Americans to stand on the sidelines, warming their hands on the flames. There would have to be American troops on the ground. But that was not supposed to be part of the script!\n\nBiden has said he was trying to find a way for Putin to back down. \"Im trying to figure out: what is Putins off-ramp?\" Biden said. \"Where does he find a way out?\"\n\nIn other words, it is Joe Biden who is now looking for a way out. But that is easier said than done.\n\nTo negotiate or not negotiate?\n\nIn the first month of the war, Ukraine and Russia held talks in which Ukraine promised it would remain neutral in exchange for the return of its territories.\n\nBut Russia called for Ukraine to recognise its annexed territories and the \"demilitarisation\" and \"denazification\" of Ukraine terms that Ukraine and its western allies refused to consider.\n\nAs noted, since then, Zelensky has said Ukraine is only prepared to enter negotiations with Russia (though not with Putin) if its troops leave all parts of the country, including Crimea and the eastern areas of the Donbas, de facto controlled by Russia since 2014, and if those Russians who have committed crimes in Ukraine face trial.\n\nBut these declarations have caused much irritation in Washington and beyond. The Washington Post revealed that US officials have warned the Ukrainian government in private that \"Ukraine fatigue\" among allies could worsen if Kyiv continues to refuse to negotiate with Putin.\n\nWhile the US has so far given Ukraine $18.9bn (16.6bn) worth of aid and says it will support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", allies in parts of Europe, not to speak of Africa and Latin America, are concerned by the strain that the war is putting on energy and food prices as well as supply chains.\n\nFor the Ukrainians, acceptance of the US request to negotiate would mean a humiliating retreat after so many months of belligerent rhetoric about the need for a decisive military defeat against Russia in order to secure Ukraines security in the long term.\n\nIs Putin in danger of overthrow?\n\nThe western propaganda is mere wish-fulfilment. It is based on a fundamental misconception. Putin has huge support and this has risen to new levels in recent months. He is not in any immediate danger of overthrow.\n\nPutin is not in any immediate danger of overthrow / Image: gov.ru\n\nThere is no significant anti-war movement in Russia and what little exists is led and directed by the bourgeois-liberal elements. That is precisely its main weakness. The workers take one look at the pro-western credentials of these elements, and turn away, cursing.\n\nThe only pressure on Putin comes, not from any anti-war movement, but on the contrary, from the Russian nationalists and others who want the war to be pursued with greater force and determination.\n\nAs for Russia, at the moment the war has the support of the majority, even if some have doubts. The imposition of sanctions and the constant stream of anti-Russian propaganda in the West, the fact that NATO and the Americans are supplying modern weapons to Ukraine, confirms the suspicion that Russia is being besieged by its enemies.\n\nThe weakness (more correctly, the absence) of the anti-war movement has already been commented on. However, if the war drags on for any length of time without significant proof of a Russian military success, that can change.\n\nIn early November more than 100 conscripts from Russias Chuvash Republic organised a protest in Ulyanov Oblast because they had not received payments promised by the Russian president.\n\nThe protesters were quickly \"pacified\" by riot police and Russian National Guard officers. But the rebellious mood of the troops was an ominous symptom for the authorities. The video of the disturbance included such comments as:\n\n\"Were risking our own lives and going to certain death for the sake of your security and peace. Our government is refusing to pay us the 195,000 roubles that President Vladimir Putin promised us! So why should we go to war for this state, leaving our families without support? \"We refuse to take part in the special military operation and will seek justice until were paid the money that was promised to us by the government led by the President of the Russian Federation!\"\n\nA small symptom, no doubt. But if the present conflict is prolonged, it could be multiplied on a far-bigger scale, posing a threat, not just to the war, but to the regime itself.\n\nThe most significant symptom is the protests of the mothers of soldiers killed in Ukraine. These are still small in size and mainly concentrated in the Caucasian Republics like Dagestan, where high levels of unemployment meant that large numbers of young men volunteered for the army.\n\nIf the war continues and the number of deaths increase, we may see protests of mothers in Moscow and Petersburg, which Putin cannot ignore and will be unable to repress. This would undoubtedly mark a change in the whole situation. But it has not materialised yet.\n\nWhat now?\n\nThe war in Ukraine has now become an important factor in world perspectives. However, there are so many variables in this equation that it is impossible to predict accurately the outcome of this war. Nor is it possible to determine with any degree of accuracy how long it may last.\n\nWar is a moving picture with many unforeseeable variants. Napoleons saying that war is the most complex of all equations retains its full force.\n\nThe variant that has been confidently advanced by the western propaganda machine ever since the commencement of hostilities appeared to be validated by the success of the Ukrainian offensive in September, and now by the Russian withdrawal from the western part of Kherson.\n\nHowever, we must guard against impressionistic conclusions drawn from a limited number of events. The outcome of wars is rarely decided by a single battle or even by several battles. The question is: did this victory, or that advance, materially alter the underlying balance of forces, which alone can determine the final result?\n\nThus far, the Ukrainians have shown a remarkable level of resilience. But how long the morale of both the civilian population and the soldiers at the front can be maintained is unclear.\n\nMore importantly, how long will America and the West be prepared to spend vast amounts of money on a war that appears to have no clear end in sight, and which is placing intolerable strains on the world economy, driving social contradictions to the limit and testing political stability to breaking point.\n\nThese fundamental questions have yet to be determined. Time will tell which link in the chain will break first. For the time being, the bloody conflict will grind on, bringing untold misery to millions of people.",

                "cc_text": "\"Oh no they didnt!\" came the collective gasp from Washington as Saudi Arabia decided last month to cut oil production and send gas prices skyward just in time for the US midterm elections. The reaction seems justified if youre viewing Saudi Arabias decision to join other Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations and Russia to tighten supply purely through the lens of a celebrity smackdown, pitting US President Joe Biden vs. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka MBS) or Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut viewed through a wider lens, the kerfuffle is overblown. Washington is, of course, smart to oppose any strengthening of Riyadhs relationship with Moscow. Bidens open-ended statement about possible US action in response to OPEC+ was measured and practical; we really dont know what the best course of action is, because most of the options have serious downsides for the United States.\n\nThose who remember the King Abdullah era of US-Saudi relations lament that Saudi Arabias approach to the United States has become purely transactional, and theyre not wrong. They should rest assured that what looks like a growing strategic relationship between Moscow and Riyadh is transactional for Riyadh as well. The Kingdom is hoping for a few things from Russia that the United States cannot provideand they all relate directly to its most critical challenges.\n\nWhat does Riyadh want from Moscow?\n\nDoing Russia a favor with its oil vote presents interesting possibilities for Riyadh vis--vis Iran, with which the Saudis severed relations in 2016. Consider the case of Russias recent acquisition of Iranian drones, which have been put to use in attacking Kyiv. It looks on the surface like the perfect reason for Saudi Arabia to kick Russia out of court. But it also presents a rare opportunity if the Saudis play their cards right with Moscowjust ask Israelto examine these drones up close or receive data on their battlefield performance. Saudi Arabia also has a keen interest in preventing Iran from using these drones to ingratiate itself with Russia.\n\nSaudi Arabia is hoping that wedging itself between Russia and Iran will bear fruit in Syria as well. Riyadh has accepted that Bashar al-Assad is sticking around, though US and Saudi strategies originally aimed for his departure from the political scene. Riyadhs new goal is to pull Damascus back into the Arab fold and away from Tehran. But no amount of largesse from the Gulf will do the job and no effort to reduce Tehrans influence will succeed unless Arab countries are willing to provide paramilitary forces and arms to Assad to secure his place at the head of government and replace the peace of mind Irans type of aid gives him. Riyadh has not entertained this. In the absence of an international strategy for reducing Iranian influence in Syria, or an achievable vision for the future of Syria from the US administration, Riyadh is pinning its hopes on aligning its interests in the future of Syria with Moscows.\n\nRussias role in blocking potential new United Nations Security Council resolutions that would limit the transfer of arms to the Houthis in Yemen has frustrated Saudi Arabia for years. Gaining leverage to flip Russias position would address what Saudi Arabia sees as an existential threat. Russias dominance in the wheat market is also important to the broader Middle East, a region struggling with food insecurity. This includes Saudi Arabia, where less than 2 percent of the land is arable, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn addition to what Washington cannot provide, Riyadh is looking for a few things that Washington will not provide. Saudi Arabia has flirted with Russias SU-57 and Chinas FC-31, both unproven attempts at approximating the United States F-35 new-generation fighter jet. Neither would interoperate with the rest of Saudis US- and European-made military aircraft. But Saudi Arabias interest in rapid military modernization is in direct conflict with both Congress and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs at the State Department, which are putting the brakes on foreign arms sales.\n\nNot to mention that an unscrupulous operator like Saud al-Qahtanian adviser suspected of directing the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi who remains in MBSs good graceswould likely love Moscow to include (under a benign information-sharing agreement, of course) some of its best practices on global assassination tactics.\n\nPolitical and fiscal handcuffs\n\nSaudi Arabias relationship with the United States should have featured as prominently in its OPEC+ decision as Riyadhs recent liaisons with Moscow. What did that side of the deliberation likely consider?\n\nTo begin with, the United States and Saudi Arabia have weathered eighty years of ups and downs; the relationship wont implode under its current strain. As Landon Derentz, the head of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council, reminded me recently, the United States and Saudi Arabia cooperated like pros to keep energy markets stable as the pandemic began, to the worlds benefit. This is part of an ebb and flow in US-Saudi cooperation on oil that corresponds to other pressures. In Washington these pressures are often political; in Riyadh they are often fiscal.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have weathered eighty years of ups and downs; the relationship wont implode under its current strain.\n\nThis time the fiscal concerns focus on funding the Vision 2030 plan for developing the Kingdom across a host of sectors. MBS has a lot riding on the success of this plan. Stern warnings about a coming global downturn in oil demand have caused the Saudis to question why they are working against their own bottom line to meet their production quotasat the United States requestwhen other producers are not. Saudi Arabias Oil Ministry cautions that over time, producing at the record-high levels the United States requests will zero out spare capacity. It could also mean the ministry cant take facilities temporarily offline for planned maintenance, raising the risk that facilities could fail suddenly, shocking the market.\n\nSeparate but related, Saudi Arabias foreign minister pays particular attention to foreign affairs conversations in Germany after spending many years there. Right now, these conversations include dismay that the United States is refusing to reduce gas prices despite pleas from friends in Europe. The irony is not lost on Riyadh.\n\nOther conversations in Europe about how to structure oil price caps sound ominous to energy producers in the Gulf concerned about such caps becoming common. And expectations of rising public pressure on these European governments once winter heating-oil needs spike cause some in Saudi Arabia to question how serious Europe will be about maintaining sanctions on Russia.\n\nAdd to these domestic concerns that few Saudis are in the mood right now to appease the United States because they feel that Washington cant keep up its end of a deal. The US-Saudi transaction around Bidens visit to Riyadh this summer involved Saudi Arabia and OPEC slightly increasing production while Biden authorized sales of defensive arms to Saudi Arabia. But world events have disrupted that gentlemens agreement. When Putin invaded Ukraine, European nations made independent decisions to donate arms, depleting their own defenses, which now require replenishment. As NATO countries, they skip to the head of the line of nations waiting for delivery of US defense articles. Delivery of items to Saudi Arabia may be pushed back by an additional two years as a result.\n\nWhile this is not a situation where the United States is intentionally slighting Gulf partners, it is a very real problem for the Kingdom, which is regularly attacked with drones and missiles from armed groups backed by Iran. In some Saudis view, if extenuating circumstances require the United States to downgrade its end of the deal a bit, Washington should not mind when extenuating circumstances (such as a projected global downturn in oil demand) cause Riyadh to do the same. Saudi analysts who do not understand the cumbersome process of US weapons transfers watch the speed with which the United States has moved defensive arms to Ukraine and ask why Washington did not do the same after the 2019 Iran-backed attack on Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq or continued attacks thereafter. Watch this space, since Riyadh claims that Tehran is planning an imminent attack on Saudi energy infrastructure again, and this time the White House says the United States wont hesitate to actthough \"act\" is undefined.\n\nPunishing the whippersnapper in Riyadh\n\nWith a burst of energy, Washington has begun looking for options to respond to the perceived slight by OPEC. There is a flurry of conversation about 9/11-based lawsuits, blocks on arms sales, the removal of Patriot air-defense systems from the peninsula, and \"NOPEC\" legislation, which could open the door to trust-busting legal action against OPEC and its member states. Riyadh has pushed back on each of these potential actions on and off for a decadethis is not the first time US policymakers have floated these punitive measuresthrough official, lobbying, and media-messaging channels.\n\nCongress doesnt agree on much, but there is support on both sides of the aisle for teaching the whippersnapper in Riyadh a lessonas evidenced in May when a Senate committee passed NOPEC.\n\nAccording to my conversations with Saudi officials, one of the promises the Biden team makes when meetings occur in Riyadh is that Saudi help with oil prices (or restraint in Yemen, or silence on the Iran nuclear deal, or assistance for Afghan evacuees, or sidelining Assad in Damascus) will be rewarded with friendly treatment in Congress. Riyadh feels like the US administration never delivered on that. Not even a little.\n\nOne of the promises the Biden team makes when meetings occur in Riyadh is that Saudi help with oil prices will be rewarded with friendly treatment in Congress. Riyadh feels like the US administration never delivered on that. Not even a little.\n\nRiyadh is now convinced that this promise of congressional softening was made because the administration did not have much more to offer, given constraints imposed by powerful members of Bidens party vehemently opposed to negotiating with the government that murdered Khashoggi. Without the ability to bring much to the table before the midterm elections, Riyadh wonders, what will the administration be able to offer after, when it is likely at least one chamber of Congress will be controlled by the opposing party?\n\nSo what options does the United States have?\n\nNOPEC resurfaces every time the United States is upset with the Kingdom. The Saudi government dreads it becoming law, but it has prepared for that scenario. Though NOPEC becoming law would certainly create oil-market instability, there is no guarantee that implementing NOPEC would result in the dissolution of OPEC. But for the sake of argument, lets say it did. Breaking up OPEC in the near future would not alter Saudi Arabias ability to drive oil prices up. The Kingdom is, after all, the worlds primary oil swing state. Meanwhile other oil-producing states already cant meet their OPEC quotas and would not be able to increase production any further even if freed from them. If anything, NOPEC could increase Saudi Arabias ability to drive prices up by taking refineries offline, perhaps with the polite excuse that these facilities suddenly require more than the regular amount of maintenance.\n\nSaudi Arabia also took action in September that limits US options for punishing its leadership. The king made MBS prime minister, just days before a State Department opinion was due to a US court on whether federal common law grants the crown prince immunity from criminal charges in the United States. Now that he is prime minister, with the legal protections that confers, there is far less room for the administration to say he has no immunity.\n\nOne of the few levers the United States has at the moment is pending arms sales. Some lawmakers argue that halting these sales could change Riyadhs mind about its relationship with Moscow. These sales are for defensive munitions loaded onto F-16 fighter jets and into Patriot batteries to defend the Kingdom against ongoing drone and missile attacks from groups that Irans president calls nonnegotiable elements of Tehrans foreign policy. Therefore, as an unintended but problematic consequence, reversing the arms sales Biden approved in August would convey the message, \"We condemn Saudi Arabias foreign policy, but we support Irans.\"\n\nBecause the United States has raised the prospect of blocking arms sales to the Kingdom for the duration of the current administration, doing so now does not send a message as strong as its proponents intend. Riyadh likely predicted that Congress would make moves in this direction, has worked through the possible permutations of this scenario several times before, and in some cases has the possibility of alternate suppliers to fall back on.\n\nSaudi Arabia might not be the loudest voice opposing proposals to prevent restocking their Patriots, either. The US militarys Central Command has been working with the Kingdom for some time, at a plodding pace, on bilateral missile defense. From Saudi Arabias perspective, the US militarys own plansincluding a calendar of regular meetings with two-star and four-star generals in the Gulfcontradict actions by members of Congress to prevent restocking of their Patriots, or other more drastic actions such as pulling troops and Patriots out of the Kingdom. (This is not being seriously considered. It would be expensive to do and would be detrimental to the United States own goals in the region. But it is an option.)\n\nAll of this is to help explain how Riyadh views the issues enraging Washington and how Saudi officials interpret their own foreign-policy options and likely US reactions. They follow US politics, the economy, and American public opinion closely, far more closely than Washington follows the Kingdoms. So how did we wind up here, with careful Saudi calculations nevertheless underestimating the ire with which the OPEC+ decision was received? In short, its a generational disconnect. MBS is thirty-seven; 60 percent of Saudis population is under thirty-five. They cannot relate to the emotional weight of a Russian invasion on the American zeitgeist.\n\nThe young leadership populating most of the innermost circle in Riyadh has no memory of the Cold War, but most US leaders were shaped by it. When a country invades a sovereign neighbor, it strikes a nerve in the United States. When that country is Russia, it gives the United States sciatica. Even the first Gulf War cant help young Saudi policy leaders understand why their oil-market alignment with Russia has evoked such vitriol. MBS was five years old when the United States went to war to oppose Iraqs invasion of Kuwaitand the United States has not gone to war for Ukraine.\n\nIts never too late for solutions\n\nCongress is going to tie itself up in details debating what should be done to respond to Saudi Arabias willingness to enable Russias cash flow while Russia is trying to erase Ukraine from the map. A searching review of US-Saudi relations is likely to be one option, though whether Congress can agree this time on just how tough it should beafter failing to do so in 2019 in the wake of the Khashoggi assassinationremains an open question. Reevaluating policy is never a bad idea; a focused review is always valuable. The White House has already pledged a review of the US-Saudi relationship following the OPEC+ decision, but it didnt specify a point person or a timeline. Saudi watchers of all stripes expected Biden to review the US relationship with Saudi Arabia early in his administration (because he said he would).\n\nSuch a review shouldnt be perceived in Riyadh as a threat. A thorough review of the relationship at all levelsnot only on defense, but in fields such as water and food security; education; renewable energy; law enforcement; womens rights; human, civil, and press rights; trafficking and illicit finance; and cultural preservationwill undoubtedly reveal a few low notes but several high notes that many officials in both capitals will find surprising and helpful in updating US policy. If Washingtons moves to punish Riyadhs OPEC+ decision are restrainedand for example do not impact the delivery of defensive arms such as Patriot munitionsMBSs advisers should work discreetly with US counterparts to minimize the oil deals impact on Russias ability to wage war in Ukraine. This could include funding defensive weapons for Ukraine or cooperating on efforts to prevent Iranian materiel from being available for Russian use.\n\nMBSs advisers should work discreetly with US counterparts to minimize the oil deals impact on Russias ability to wage war in Ukraine. This could include funding defensive weapons for Ukraine or cooperating on efforts to prevent Iranian materiel from being available for Russian use.\n\nTo reiterate a suggestion from Derentz at the Atlantic Councils Global Energy Center, Saudi Arabia should also offer ideas for improving global access to affordable oil supply. \"In the context of a major global energy crisis, the Kingdom would benefit from reasserting leadership over international efforts to increase supply, which would help redirect the conversation with the United States and Europe in a way that benefits both customers and producers,\" he said. Saudi Arabia is the only nation with any leverage over Russian oil policy and output at the moment, so it is in a good position to help with thisand Washington should insist that it do so.\n\nThe problem for US policymakers right now is not that Saudi Arabia is choosing Moscow over Washington. The problem is that Saudi Arabia feels like it has the upper hand over both Moscow and Washington. Moscow and Riyadh played King of the Mountain over energy-sector dominance in March of 2020, waging a price war that Saudi Arabia won. And that was before Russia started a war that got it sanctioned. So the Saudis are very confident right now that they can control Russias options on energy policy. But transactional foreign policy being the order of the day, the United States and Europe will need to bring something to the table to make it worth Riyadhs while to do so. Right now, that could be as simple as choosing not to enact punishments (that come with blowback) on Saudi Arabia for being a swing state.\n\nDe-escalate the policy review\n\nUS inaction following the 2019 attack on Abqaiq and blocks on arms sales in years since hint that Washington is over the Carter Doctrine of protecting Gulf countries against external threats. This OPEC+ decision indicates that Riyadh is too.\n\nIn both capitals, there are diametrically opposed opinions about how to reframe the relationship. Resolving those internal differences will be harder than reaching agreement between the two countries on mutual interests.\n\nTherefore, a possible first step could be an informal track 1.5 process with both nations sending policy experts to discuss cooperation and redlines. The agreements signed during Bidens summer trip to the Kingdom represent a solid list of sectors in which cooperation will create value for both countries, so some of the legwork has been done.\n\nThe deliverable would be a draft framework based not on a transaction to secure two individual critical objectives (energy for security), but on a set of shared objectives critical to both capitals. These do actually exist: Both countries have an interest in a smooth energy transition, regional security and stability, the free flow of commerce, and the harnessing of technology to advance development. The dialogues work should be based on a recognition that each country can move much faster and farther in partnership with the other.\n\nThis framework should also include a set of negotiated redlines, the crossing of which would void the agreement and require a re-convening of the track 1.5 process. Decisionmakers in both countries should agree to pursue the frameworks implementation regardless of cabinet shuffles or administration changes.\n\nThere is a second step Washington could take that would provide a win for all sides. A reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship is a great excuse to clean up the US military footprint in the Kingdom. Its past time. To quote one former official at the US Military Training Mission (USMTM) in Riyadh, \"the 80s called and they want their security cooperation back.\" Saudi defense ministry officials made clear to the Pentagon during a visit to Washington this year that there is support in the Kingdom for a reorganization of USMTM. This is because Saudi Arabia pays over fifty million dollars toward USMTM operations. Riyadh could slash this tomorrow, like they did six years ago to the US military organization that manages activities with Saudi Arabias National Guard. Military leaders in Riyadh are asking why they need to fund roughly 250 Americans with the mission to train Saudis on the use of US military systems if Washington refuses to sell them US military systems anymore. Add to this that USMTM operates under State Department authorities rather than the Department of Defense (DOD).\n\n\"A reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship is a great excuse to clean up the US military footprint in the Kingdom. Its past time.\"\n\nTo achieve a win for all sides, the Biden administration could convert USMTM into a standard security cooperation office under the DODs Senior Defense Official for Saudi Arabia (as has been discussed since at least 2015), downsize to the staff necessary to run foreign military sales (FMS) cases, and redistribute remaining FMS administration billets to other locations. This would reduce the number of DOD personnel in Saudi Arabia, a win for members of Congress from both parties who are pressuring Biden to scale down the US militarys support for Saudi Arabia. It would modernize the structure of US security cooperation in the Kingdom, a win for the DOD. It would free up tens of millions of dollars in the Saudi defense budget, a little win for the Saudi ministry of defense. And it would preserve the US-Saudi strategic relationship, a win for the US administration.\n\nIf the vibe in Washington is that this approach is too soft, lets remind ourselves who the adversary actually is at the root of the kerfuffle over energy production and prices. (Hint: Its not Saudi Arabia.) Strengthening the United States partnerships abroad is a pillar of the new National Security Strategy precisely because its a proven method of securing US interests. Severing them is not.\n\nKirsten Fontenrose is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Councils Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.

It could serve as a springboard for more advances into occupied territory.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called it a \"significant victory\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"I can do nothing but applaud the courage, determination and capacity of the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian military,\" he said on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Indonesia. \"Theyve really been amazing. ... were going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves.\"\n\nLarge parts of eastern and southern Ukraine are still under Russian control, and the city of Kherson itself remains within reach of Moscows shells and missiles. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere in Ukraine. Russias state news agency RIA Novosti reported the town of Oleshky, in Russian-held territory across the Dnieper River from Kherson, came under heavy artillery fire.\n\nZelenskyy awarded medals to soldiers in Kherson and posed with them for selfies while striking a defiant note.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the end of the war,\" he said. \"We are step by step coming to all the temporarily occupied territories.\"\n\nBut he also grimly noted the fighting \"took the best heroes of our country.\"\n\nThe end of Russias occupation of the city the only provincial capital seized since the February invasion has sparked days of celebration. But as winter approaches, its remaining 80,000 residents are without heat, water and electricity, and short on food and medicine. Zelenskyy says the city is laced with booby traps and mines. And Ukrainian authorities say there are signs of atrocities emerging, just as in other liberated areas.\n\nRussian forces \"destroyed everything in their path, wrecked the entire electricity network,\" he said. Communications operators said cellphone service was being restored and the regional governor said a public wireless internet access point would begin working Tuesday.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine has won \"an important victory\" in Kherson and other areas west of the Dnieper, but the Washington-based think tank noted that \"it has by no means liberated the minimum territory essential to its future security and economic survival.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Moscow should not be underestimated.\n\n\"The Russian armed forces retain significant capability as well as a large number of troops, and Russia has demonstrated their willingness to bear significant losses,\" he said in The Hague.\n\nIn Ankara, Turkey, CIA Director Bill Burns met with his Russian intelligence counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, to underscore the consequences if Moscow were to deploy a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, according to a White House National Security Council official.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Burns and Naryshkin, the head of Russias SVR spy agency, did not discuss settlement of the war. Their meeting was the highest-ranking face-to-face engagement between U.S. and Russian officials since before the invasion.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have warned for months of the prospect that Russia could use weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine amid battlefield setbacks, Biden administration officials have repeatedly said nothing has changed in U.S. intelligence assessments to suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin has imminent plans to deploy nuclear weapons.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly, meanwhile, passed a resolution calling for establishing a mechanism to assess Russian reparations for damages and injuries in Ukraine. The resolution is not binding and Russias ambassador said it had no legal validity.\n\nZelenskyys trip to Kherson was another in a series of unexpected visits to front-line areas at crucial moments of the war. It was laden with symbolism and the common touch aimed at boosting the morale of soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nIn a video, a visibly moved Zelenskyy stood with his hand on his heart and sang the national anthem as troops saluted and stood at attention and a soldier raised the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag.\n\nResidents draped with flags on their shoulders cheered, cried and shouted in gratitude as Zelenskyy walked by.\n\n\"Its amazing. Weve been waiting for him for nine months. Thank you,\" said Danila Yuhrenko.\n\nSerhii Yukhmchuk, 47, said he and his wife spent the occupation mostly at home to avoid any Russians and protested by refusing to use the ruble as currency.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment on Zelenskyys visit, except to say: \"You know that it is the territory of the Russian Federation.\" Russia illegally annexed the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian provinces earlier this year, in addition to annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nIn his Sunday night address, Zelenskyy said that \"investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, and the bodies of both civilians and military personnel have been found.\"\n\n\"In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country,\" he said. \"We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt.\"\n\nResidents said Russian troops plundered the city and wrecked key infrastructure before retreating across the wide Dnieper River to its east bank last week.\n\nReconnecting the electricity supply is the priority, regional Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said.\n\nThe arrival of winter is making the situation more difficult, with Stoltenberg saying that Putin is aiming \"to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter.\"\n\nBiden said he expected things to slow down somewhat militarily \"because of the winter months and the inability to move as easily around.\"\n\nIn the past two months, Ukraines military claimed to have retaken dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson, a key gateway to Crimea to the south.\n\nBut the grinding war continued with shelling, civilian casualties and each side reporting gains.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its forces had captured the village of Pavlivka in the eastern Donetsk region. Multiple Ukrainian officials have reported heavy battles there in recent weeks.\n\nIn Luhansk, another eastern region illegally annexed by Moscow, Kyivs forces have retaken 12 settlements, said regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai.\n\nA senior U.S. military official said missile and drone strikes have slowed down a bit in Ukraine since the end of October. The U.S. doesnt know the specific reason for the decline, the official said, but noted that Russia continues to see its weapons stockpiles decrease, particularly precision-guided munitions.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide the U.S. military assessment, said Russia continues to hit civilian infrastructure, including the electrical grid, and the U.S. has no reason to believe Moscow will let up on its attacks any time soon.\n\nAsked if the U.S. will scale back its weapons contributions to Kyiv as winter takes hold, and fighting is likely to level off a bit, the official said Washington will continue to work with allies to ensure it has what it needs and that air defense systems will be an ongoing priority.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers John Leicester in Kyiv, Hanna Arhirova in Odesa, Ukraine, and Aamer Madhani and Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow APs coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Ukrainians in the occupied southern region of Kherson are being forced from their homes, the Ukrainian military and activists warned on Tuesday, as local officials installed by Russia expanded the area from which civilians have been ordered to leave and Moscows troops rushed to fortify defensive positions.\n\nAhead of a possible battle for control of the key region, the Ukrainian military said that the widening calls by occupation officials for people to leave the area were part of a campaign to terrorize and forcibly deport tens of thousands of civilians from the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nUkrainian troops have been pushing to dislodge Russian forces entrenched around the city of Kherson, on the western bank of the river. Kherson is a shipbuilding city about 340 miles from the capital of Kyiv. The city is important for gaining access to the Black Sea and Crimea, and also provides a path to Ukraines southern coastline for invading Russian forces. Its loss would deal both a strategic and psychological blow to Russia.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Ukrainian military high command said that Russian forces had \"set up technical fortifications\" and mines or explosives around civilian housing in the Kherson region, most likely to use as defensive positions for a looming battle.\n\nThe Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. But residents in Kherson who were contacted by phone, and accounts of those who have fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory, have described intimidation by Russian forces and local officials as Ukrainian troops advance in the south.\n\n\"They intimidate people and make them evacuate,\" a Kherson resident named Tetiana, 60, said in a text message on Tuesday, asking that her surname not be used for her safety. She said she has refused to leave her apartment in0 Kherson despite pressure from officials to \"go to the so called safe regions of Russia.\"\n\nThen, she added, \"Russian soldiers take the houses of those who left and loot everything.\"\n\nA little over a week ago, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed governor of Kherson, said tens of thousands of people should evacuate the regional capital. Just six days later, he claimed that effort was complete, although Ukrainian officials said that only a few thousand people had left, most of them loyal to Russia. Mr. Saldo also issued a pointed warning that all those who remain could be considered hostile.\n\nImage A damaged Russian tank in the village of Myroliubivka, which was liberated by Ukrainian forces in September.

Ivor Prickett for The New York Times\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Saldo expanded the area from which civilians should leave to all towns, villages and cities within 10 miles of the river, possibly indicating the line Russia would defend to try to keep hold of both the city of Kherson and the critically important dam in Kakhovka, about 40 miles upriver to the northeast, which feeds fresh water to Crimea.\n\nBeyond calling for the \"evacuation\" of everyone within 10 miles of the river on the western bank, Russian-allied officials on Tuesday night said the order would include the entire district around the dam, including those living on the eastern side of the Dnipro.\n\nInside the city of Kherson, residents said the situation grew more dire by the day. A woman named Katerina, 38, wrote in a text message over the weekend that they could hear \"fighting on the outskirts of the city.\"\n\n\"The city is empty,\" she wrote. \"As if it were dying. But we are alive. We keep on and wait. To meet the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\n\nAnna Lukinova and Oleksandr Chubko contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "It is no secret that arms control is becoming a lost art. While the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were filled with strategic arms control talks, only one treaty limiting nuclear arsenals has entered into force over the past two decades: New START (the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Notwithstanding the innovations in its verification regime, the treaty relied heavily on the existing principles of the original START Treaty, together with many of the core players experiences negotiating and ratifying it 20 years earlier.\n\nSince then, however, Russias Putin era and, with it, the growing distrust between Russia and the United States, as well as the retirement of Cold War and post-Cold War arms control experts, have stalled any progress. Other treaties such as the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF Treaty) have been abandoned, and other nuclear-armed states remain outside arms limitation agreements. Despite new technologies and a new security architecture requiring more thought than ever before, substantive proposals and good faith negotiations have been replaced by empty talking points. Additionally, in recent years both the United States and Russia have engaged in unconstructive blaming and shaming efforts, which have further soured the arms control environment and lowered the political will for pursuing negotiations in good faith.\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon advance proportional efforts to overcome these forces, it is only prudent to expect that February 4, 2026 will be the last day of bilateral strategic arms control (Albertson 2021, 78). As a first step, the United States and Russia, on August 25, 2022, submitted a statement to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT Review Conference) committing to \"pursue negotiations in good faith on a successor framework to New START before its expiration in 2026, in order to achieve deeper, irreversible, and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals\" (2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 2022). But that commitment so far appears to be blocked by the dispute over Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nTreaty history\n\n1972/1979: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II)\n\nNuclear arms limitation treaties emerged during a period of intense buildup of US and Soviet strategic nuclear forces. In the late 1960s, the United States realized that the Soviet Union was building up its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) forces to reach parity with the United States and had also begun to construct a limited anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense system around Moscow. Concerned that Russia might eventually be able to launch a first strike and then block US retaliation, President Lyndon Johnson called for strategic arms limitations talks (SALT). The hope was that US-Soviet relations could be stabilized through limits on the development of both offensive and defensive strategic systems (US Department of State 2022).\n\nBy 1972, the Soviets were convinced that defensive systems had limitations, allowing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and SALT I to be negotiated and enter into force. SALT I was considered an interim agreement that consisted of a simple freeze, not yet including on-site inspections. Its verification relied on national technical means, referring to intelligence satellites and related capabilities. However, the term was officially left undefined to protect intelligence methods and avoid offending Soviet sensibilities (Gottemoeller 2021, 2; Aftergood 2019).\n\nIn 1979, the United States and the Soviet Union completed the negotiation of SALT II which set a limit of 2,400 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (including ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers), banned the construction of new ICBMs, and limited the number of multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to 1,320. However, the treaty never entered into force due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as well as some US senators criticisms of the Soviet Unions crackdown on internal dissent, the Soviets increasingly interventionist foreign policies, the treatys verification process, and SALT IIs failure to sufficiently limit Soviet MIRV technology that would allow missiles to carry multiple warheads (US Department of State n.d.; Cameron 2022). Nonetheless, both sides agreed to voluntarily observe the SALT II-negotiated limits in subsequent years (US Department of State n.d.).\n\nAs former US Secretary of Defense and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Robert Gates noted, the process itself was likely the most useful part of these talks: \"For the first time, the two sides sat down and began a dialogue about their nuclear weapons and, implicitly, their nuclear strategies. Military and civilian leaders on both sides were able to take the measure of one another and, at the same time, engage their political leaders in an unprecedented way in learning about the balance of terror\" (Gates 1996, 45).\n\n1991: Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)\n\nPartially due to the further development of MIRV technology on both sides, the Americans and Soviets realized that strategic systems had to be reduced to prevent either sides out-deployment in warhead numbers. This realization led to the 1980s Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), which eventually became the first ratified treaty that required US and Russian reductionsrather than a mere freezeof strategic nuclear weapons. The START Treaty, signed in 1991 with entry into force three years later, limited both countries to 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 6,000 warheads attributed to ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, and included more detailed sub-limits. Once Russia believed that the benefits of on-site inspections outweighed their concerns over giving the United States reciprocal access, nothing was standing in the way of a verifiable arms control treaty to create more predictability. The detailed verification regime of START, including databases, notifications, and on-site inspections, allowed both sides to better calculate necessary deterrence investments while preventing an arms race (Gottemoeller 2021, 3).\n\nThe United States and Russia subsequently negotiated and signed START II in 1993, committing to additional reductions down to 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads on ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers by the end of 2007. Importantly, the treaty included a ban on multiple warheads on ICBMs. While the treaty never entered into force despite a decade-long bilateral effort, it strongly shaped the US Strategic Commands long-term force structure planning (Kristensen 2001, 12).\n\n2002: the Moscow Treaty (SORT)\n\nUnder the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT), also called the Moscow Treaty, Russia and the United States agreed in 2002 to further reduce their nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic warheads each by December 31, 2012a nearly two-third reduction from the START I limits. While progressive in its numerical limits, SORT was a very simple treaty, with its text barely exceeding one page and not providing any separate verification measures. Instead, Russia and the United States decided they would continue to rely on START to provide verification until its expiration in December 2009 (US Department of State 2002).\n\n2010: the New START Treaty\n\nFinally, the New START Treaty (officially the \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms\") succeeded in further limiting the US- and Russian- deployed long-range nuclear forces down to 1,550 warheads and 700 delivery vehiclesthe lowest in over 60 years. For that purpose, New START for the first time counted the actual number of warheads found on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs, rather than mathematically calculating numbers based on missile tests as in START. Since bombers do not carry nuclear weapons under normal circumstances, each deployed heavy bomber was attributed one warhead by default to make bombers accountable under the treaty (US Department of State 2010). Therefore, the warheads attributed to bombers do not reflect actual warhead loadsunlike for missiles. Delivery vehicles under New START encompass deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear armaments. It was not until far into the negotiations that Russia and the United States determined these numbers, with Russia originally asking for more warheads while the United States requested more delivery vehicles to protect its advantage in that area (Gottemoeller 2021, 34).\n\nIn addition to the further reduction of these limits, New START created an entirely new limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed launchers. Although this concept was originally introduced by Russia, the United States later embraced the idea as it would, first, prevent Russia from building and storing unlimited numbers of mobile missile launchers since these would count toward the non-deployed limit, and, second, provide the United States with the flexibility to convert bombers to conventional use and overhaul submarines since these would not count under the deployed limits during those processes (Gottemoeller 2021, 83, 112).\n\nAnother aspect of New STARTs flexibility is the preserved \"freedom to mix,\" where each side can decide the composition and structure of its strategic offensive forces if it stays below the total limits. Russia, being a great land power, could continue to rely primarily on ICBMs. On the contrary, the United States, being a sea power, was able to keep more SLBMs than Russia (Gottemoeller 2021, 32). The mix chosen by the United States included no more than 400 deployed ICBMs, no more than 240 deployed SLBMs, and no more than 60 deployed heavy bombers. Beyond an additional 100 non-deployed launchers, a significant number of excess launchers had to be denuclearized or destroyed. Because Russia had significantly fewer launchers than the United States, it did not have to reduce its deployed force.\n\nMost importantly, however, the New START Treaty created what has often been referred to as the \"gold standard\" of verification: procedures governing the conversion and elimination of strategic offensive arms, the establishment and operation of a database of treaty-required information, transparency measures, a commitment not to interfere with national technical means of verification, the exchange of telemetric information, the conduct of on-site inspection activities, and the operation of the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) (US Department of State 2022).\n\nInnovations in New STARTs verification regime managed to address both sides concerns about the old START treatys verification regime while better balancing information and burdena core military interest on both sides.\n\nFirst, it streamlined STARTs more burdensome verification regime into two types of verifications: one for deployed systems (Type One) and the other for non-deployed systems (Type Two). They largely encompassed the aspects of previously separate types of inspectionsresulting in slightly longer but much less frequent (up to ten Type One and up to eight Type Two) short-notice on-site inspections annually. This solution fulfilled both militaries interest in avoiding too frequent or overly intrusive inspections that could disrupt operational tempo for days (Gottemoeller 2021, 50).\n\nSecond, it enabled real-time tracking of each others forces by introducing unique identifying numbers for launchers and delivery vehicles, utilizing the existing serial numbers each country already used to track and account for its weapons. This gave inspectors a clear idea of the weapons they needed to find at each site (Gottemoeller 2021, 52).\n\nThird, New START addressed rising cost and accuracy concerns about the conversion and elimination of certain weapon systems. To allow satellites to confirm eliminations, for instance, it determined space and time requirements for displaying eliminated missiles and other treaty accountable items and established the right to request reciprocal inspections of such. To address US concerns about overcounting delivery vehicles under the previous treaty, New START also introduced simplified measures to confirm US conversion and elimination processes, particularly the conversion of all B-1 bombers to conventional-only platforms, the conversion of submarine tubes, and the total elimination of B-52 bombers (Gottemoeller 2021, 121122).\n\nIn the end, while Russia had originally urged for a simpler treaty like SORT, it has praised New START as the \"gold standard\" for verification (Alexander and Ferraro 2010).\n\nThe treaty entered into force on February 5, 2011, and provided the parties with seven years to reduce their forces to these agreed-upon limits. Both sides successfully met the central limits by February 5, 2018, and have since stayed at or below them. Russia and the United States extended the originally 10-year treaty to its maximum 15-year length, now set to expire on February 4, 2026 (US Department of State 2022).\n\nTable 1 compares the limits and verification mea- sures from SALT I to New START.\n\nThe New START Treaty remains in force through February 4, 2026. If no follow-on agreement is concluded before its expiration, then February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals. In other words, anyone under the age of 54 will, for the first time, live in a world without strategic arms control.\n\nShort of a new treaty, Russia and the United States would lose mutual predictability and trust. It would also mean that military planners would have to rely more on worst-case scenarios, subsequently accelerating defense spending that could result in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nSuch a gloomy future is, of course, avoidable. The United States and Russia have several options available to maintain strategic limitations on their arsenals, includingin order of increasing resulting predictability but decreasing feasibilitycontinued adherence through mutual moratoria, the negotiation of a new executive agreement, or the conclusion of an entirely new treaty.\n\nWe explore each one of these three options in this issue. But, to illustrate the urgency with which both countries should pursue them, we first offer a realistic scenario of how US and Russian arsenals could evolve if the current trends remain unchangedthat is, if the last bilateral arms control treaty still active is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement.\n\nThe arms race in high gear\n\nUp until now, both countries have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that both countries will not exceed the force levels dictated by New START. Without bilateral arms control, however, this planning will be thrown into an era of unpredictability and distrust. Both sides would need to reassess their programs to accommodate more uncertain nuclear futures. This would likely result in worst-case scenario planning based on fewer data points and the uncertainty of future force levelsincluding those that would likely exceed New START levels. This could drive significant increases in both countries arsenals, and ultimately lead to mutual accusations of arms racing and international accusations of NPT violations.\n\nThe United States and Russia each have significant numbers of additional nuclear warheads in storage that cannot be loaded on the launchers because of the New START limit of 1,550 deployed warheads. If New START fell away, these warheads could be uploaded in days, weeks, or months, depending on the type of launcher.\n\nThe United States has a significant upload capacity for its deployed missiles. Although all 400 of its deployed ICBMs currently only carry a single warhead, 200 of these use the Mk-12A reentry vehicle and are therefore capable of carrying up to three W78 warheads each. Moreover, the United States has an additional 50 \"warm\" ICBM silos which could be reloaded with missiles if necessary. If the 200 Mk-12A-equipped missiles were uploaded to three warheads each and the 50 reloaded missiles were also equipped with three warheads each, the ICBM force loading could potentially increase from 400 to 950 warheads. In the absence of treaty limitations, the United States could also upload each of its deployed Trident SLBMs with a full complement of eight warheads, rather than the current average of four to five. It could also reactivate the four launch tubes on each nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN)56 in totalthat were disabled under New START. This could potentially more than double the number of deployed US SLBM warheads from approximately 944 today to approximately 2,300 warheads.\n\nEither of these actions would likely take months to complete, particularly given the complexities involved with uploading additional warheads on ICBMs. Moreover, ballistic missile submarines would have to return to port for uploading on a rotating schedule. However, deploying additional warheads to US bomber bases could be done very quickly, and the United States could potentially upload nearly 700 cruise missiles and bombs on B-52 and B-2 bombers.\n\nRussia also has a significant upload capacity, especially for its ICBMs. Russias 40 SS-18 Satan ICBMs can carry up to ten MIRVs; however, it is assumed that they have been downloaded to carry only five to meet the New START limitations. The incoming RS-28 Sarmat ICBM is also reportedly capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs; however, it is assumed that these too will be downloaded upon their deployment if the New START force limits are retained. The SS-27 Yars is also assumed to have been downloaded from four MIRVs to three. As a result, without the limits imposed by New START, Russias ICBM force could potentially increase from approximately 812 warheads to approximately 1,185 warheads.\n\nSubmarine-launched ballistic missiles on Russian Borei-class SSBNs are also thought to have been downloaded from an estimated six warheads to four to meet New START limits. Without these limitations, the number of deployed warheads on Russian SSBNs could rise from an estimated 576 to approximately 800. As in the US case, Russian bombers could be loaded relatively quickly with hundreds of nuclear weapons. The number is highly uncertain but assuming approximately 50 bombers are operational, the number of weapons could potentially be increased to nearly 600.\n\nTable 2 considers how both US and Russian strategic nuclear forces could increase if New START is allowed to expire without a follow-on agreement in place. If both countries uploaded their delivery systems to accommodate the maximum number of possible warheads, both sets of arsenals would approximately double in size. The United States would have slightly more deployable strategic warheads but Russia would still have a significantly larger arsenal of operational nuclear weapons, given its sizable stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear warheads.\n\nTable 2 presents a worst-case scenario for possible warhead uploads if New START is allowed to expire without any follow-on. Because of the relatively low estimated cost of a simple upload across the triad (about $100 million in one-time costs to the United States), this scenario is not impossible from a budgeting perspective (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3).\n\nIn the longer term, both countries could theoretically go further and pursue costly larger expansions of their strategic nuclear forces, such as going back up to the START I level of 6,000 warheads each. Some voices in the United States have already raised doubts about the New START force limits because of Chinas nuclear buildup (Miller 2022). Depending on the desired degree of flexibility and the cost of new strategic delivery systems, such an expansion could cost the United States, for instance, between $88 billion to $439 billion in one-time acquisition costs, plus $4 billion to $28 billion in annual operation and sustainment costs (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 3). This does not even include research and development costs or the Department of Energys costs to produce, sustain, or store more nuclear warheads. It is unclear what the costs of similar actions would be for Russia, but they are likely to also be very expensive.\n\nMoreover, there are expected consequences beyond the offensive strategic nuclear forces that New START regulates. If the verification regime and data exchanges elapse, both countries are likely to enhance their intelligence capabilities to make up for the uncertainty regarding the other sides nuclear forces. Both countries are also likely to invest more into what they perceive will increase their overall military capabilities, such as conventional missile forces, nonstrategic nuclear forces, and missile defense (Congressional Budget Office 2020, 79). These would all come with significant additional costs.\n\nOverall, todays technologies and the geopolitical situation would likely lead to a different style of arms racing than during the Cold War; however, it could similarly become unnecessarily costly and dangerous. Moreover, it could trigger reactions in other nuclear-armed states that might also decide to increase their nuclear forces and the role they play in their military strategies. The good news is that this future is certainly not inevitableeven without a formalized treaty structure beyond 2026. The following sections offer a series of options for both countries that would help prevent an escalation of the arms race. The estimated success of each option depends upon a variety of factors, including political will, legal complexities, and relative degrees of formalization. The following sections are listed in order of their projected feasibility, and thus begin with Plan Cthe most feasible but least sustainable optionand end with Plan A the most challenging yet most optimal outcome.\n\nPlan C: continued adherence to New STARTs core provisions beyond 2026\n\nOne option would be for both countries to simply continue abiding by the core provisions of the treatyeven without the treaty being formally in effect. Such a \"gentlemans agreement\" could be made by the leaders of both the United States and Russia without legislative approval, as opposed to a formal treaty. By agreeing to not exceed the New START limits, each side could continue its current strategic force structure planning and therefore avoid a costly expansion.\n\nSuch an agreement, however, also comes with challenges. Practically, the United States and Russia could certainly continue to adhere to the treaty limitsmuch as they did for a brief period of four months in the interim between START and New START. But without the legal structure of a treaty, the main verification benefits of New STARTdata exchanges, notifications, and inspections could be lost due to the legal difficulties surrounding classified information. This could force both parties to rely exclusively on national technical means for verification, which would severely strain both the resources and capabilities of their respective intelligence communities.\n\nWe now examine the feasibility of this option.\n\nCould bilateral data exchanges and notifications continue after 2026?\n\nWithout a treaty framework to enable the legal exchange of otherwise classified or restricted nuclear weapons data, both Russia and the United States would need to prepare legal avenues to allow them to continue sharing this information. According to former New START chief US negotiator, Rose Gottemoeller, the United States continued notifications as a goodwill gesture and was willing to continue data exchanges during the bridge period between START and New START (Gottemoeller 2022). Given this precedent, it should again be feasible for the United States to legally arrange for data exchanges and notifications. On the other side, Russia did not continue reciprocal notifications during the interim period, despite its promise to continue abiding by the treatys limits. To that end, Russia will need to examine whether it might need to first amend its domestic laws concerning the sharing of classified nuclear information.\n\nCould bilateral on-site inspections continue after 2026?\n\nThe question of on-site inspections continuing beyond the scope of a formalized treaty has been considered by Gottemoeller. In her book, Negotiating the New START Treaty, she notes that:\n\n\"The Russians also raised doubts about the legal status of such an agreement. According to them, they needed a full, legally-binding treaty, duly approved by their State Duma and Federation Council, in order to override their domestic law and permit foreign inspectors. According to the Russian state security law, no foreigners are allowed in sensitive nuclear facilities. A treaty can override that domestic law\" (Gottemoeller 2021, 8586).\n\nThe United States also has laws restricting the access of foreign nationals to sensitive military installations. These too could be overridden by an international treaty, as has been the case with New START.\n\nIt would theoretically be possible for both countries to change their domestic laws to enable on-site inspections to continue in the absence of a treaty framework. There is precedent for attempting this in the United States: In 2009, facing the possibility that START might expire without a follow-on treaty in place, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) brought to the table a bill specifically designed to provide Russian inspectors with the ability to continue on-site inspections for seven months or until the entry into force of a new bilateral treatywhichever came first (S.2727 2009). The bill was ultimately not passed, but its introduction to Congress suggests that a similar path could be considered again if necessary. Such a bill could specifically require the continued implementation of the expired treatys verification protocol and annexes that contain highly detailed instructions for how on-site inspections are to be conducted, including requisite flight paths, aircraft call signs, customs exemptions, lodging, accommodations, and the according of diplomatic immunity upon each partys inspectors and aircrew, among other granular details.\n\nIn the absence of a follow-on treaty, rather than attempting to maintain all existing verification mechanisms, another option could be to reduce the scope of the verification regime altogether. While conventional wisdom holds that more verification is always better, recent scholarship indicates that this may not always be the case. In his doctoral dissertation, political scientist Andrew Reddie posits that \"the most intrusive types of verification are not, as is currently believed, more likely to lead to compliance\" (Reddie 2019). Instead, Reddies analysisbased on more than 1,000 agreement-years of historical datasuggests that highly intrusive inspections could yield a statistically significant greater likelihood of noncompliance than less intrusive types of verification regimes. Reddie suggests that this phenomenon could be the result of a \"surveillance bias,\" in which it is possible that \"a hammer (representing a verification regime) will constantly search for and find a nail (noncompliance). Thus, those agreements that have a more stringent verification mechanisma larger hammermay have a higher probability of detecting non-compliance\" (Reddie 2019).\n\nIf a reduction in the intrusiveness of the treatys verification regime would not necessarily increase the likelihood of noncompliance, both parties could use the opportunity of New STARTs expiration to possibly reduce the invasiveness of future verification mechanisms. This would avoid unwanted challenges triggered by the loss of the treatys inspection protocols once it expires while continuing to adhere to its core provisions and central limits. For example, the United States and Russia could place a hold on conducting Type One and Type Two inspections but continue to exchange compliance data and promise not to interfere with the other partys national technical means of verification.\n\nEven though after New START expires there would be no legal requirement to comply with the treatys core provisions, both countries would still likely have strong normative and geopolitical incentives to continue doing so. This is partially because of the riskeven without on-site inspectionsthat any increase would be detected and exposed by the other sides national technical means. Moreover, during the treatys history, there have been several extended periods when Type One and Type Two inspections were suspendedmost notably during the Covid-19 pandemic, when inspections were paused for nearly two years. During these periods there were no accusations of noncompliance by either side.\n\nA reduction of the verification regime may not necessarily create a compliance problem, but it could create a political one. Historically, Congress has been more amenable to support and provide the resources to implement agreements with robust verification regimes, whereas agreements with relatively looser verification mechanisms, such as SORT or the US-Iran Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have faced fierce resistance. This challenge could be exacerbated by relying exclusively on national technical means for verification, which could potentially result in the intelligence community issuing ranged estimates of Russian warheads and delivery systems rather than knowing the exact numbers of warheads and launchers. Even though using a range in place of a definite number may not significantly affect the United States deterrence calculations, it could produce a domestic political backlash. For instance, if the ranges upper boundary ever came too close to the treatys central limits, the public debate would most likely crystalize over such a high-end estimate and cast doubt about Russias compliance. This challenge is evident in the current debate about how many non-strategic nuclear warheads Russia has. Because these warheads are not limited and declared under a treaty, the US Intelligence Community uses a range of 1,0002,000 warheads, of which the Pentagon uses the higher number, even though the Department of State says it includes retired warheads (US Department of State 2022, 11).\n\nUnder such a \"gentlemans agreement,\" any previously existing protocols to facilitate dispute resolution between the state parties would no longer be formally in effect. The Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC)the joint body authorized to resolve compliance questions, make technical changes to the treatys protocol and annexes as new weapons are deployed, and mediate other treaty-related disputeswould be officially defunct upon New STARTs expiration. As a result, if one party accused the other of materially breaching the agreement, there would be no formal mechanism for mediating and resolving that dispute. This challenge could be mitigated by the establishment of a new mechanism that mirrors the current role of the BCC.\n\nIn effect, continuing to adhere to New STARTs core provisions would be an informal way of extending the treatys benefits. While this informality would certainly create challenges, the tacit knowledge and practices learned through 15 years of successful New START implementation could help transition both parties into such a new framework. While this option may not be sustainable in the long term, it could be considered a short-term bridge between New START and a follow-on agreement. This could prove particularly useful in the interim period if a mutual political commitment to the treaty remains, but time runs out before a new agreement can be concluded.\n\n*************\n\nAnother obstacle to a non-legally binding handshake agreement is Russias historical insistence on having formally ratified treaties. For instance, Gottemoeller explained that Russia previously rejected a non-legally-binding bridging agreement after START, as it was afraid this would take away the necessary pressure needed to eventually reach a ratified treaty with the United States (Gottemoeller 2022). Russias insistence on formally ratified treaties may also be motivated by its fear that a future US administration could easily pull out of a negotiated executive deal. It is not known how flexible Russia might be today given the diminished likelihood that a two-thirds majority of the US Senate will vote to ratify an arms control treaty with Russia, particularly in the context of Putins invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPlan B: pursuing an executive agreement\n\nAnother option for the United States could be to conclude a follow-on (sole presidential or congressional) executive agreement that would not require the Senates advice and consent for ratification as an Article II treaty would, but would still be as legally binding. Today, more than 90 percent of the United States international agreements are executive agreements concluded by the president (Bradley and Goldsmith 2018, 1278). In the field of arms control, however, executive agreements are still largely unexplored.\n\nA distinctive advantage of pursuing an executive agreement over an Article II treaty is that it would allow each countrys head of state to bypass the Senates advice and consent required for Article II treaty ratification. This would be particularly valuable for the United States given the high degree of political polarization and low likelihood of bipartisan Senate support.\n\nThe flip side of this advantage for the United States, however, is that bypassing Congress in this way could create political backlash for a president. Congress could potentially block funding for a president to implement an executive agreement with Russia or even hold other presidential priorities at risk.\n\nMoreover, if such an executive agreement included anything that could be construed to be a \"further arms reduction,\" it could be challenged under the US Arms Control and Disarmament Act:\n\n\"No action shall be taken pursuant to this chapter or any other Act that would obligate the United States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution or unless authorized by the enactment of further affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States\" (22 USC Ch. 35, Section 2573(b) 1961).\n\nA sole-presidential executive agreement inherently has substantially less congressional buy-in than a treaty ratified with the advice and consent of the Senate. Similar to politically-binding agreements, such an executive agreement is likely to be associated directly with the president who concluded it and could therefore be subject to violation or withdrawal by a subsequent president wanting to distinguish themselves from their predecessor. The fate of the JCPOA between the United States and Iranin this case a politically- and not legally-binding agreementexemplifies this dynamic. In 2018, against the advice of nonproliferation experts and many of his own advisors, President Donald Trump violated the agreement mainly because of its association with his predecessor, President Barack Obama, who signed the deal in 2015. This can be contrasted with the fate of New START, which was also negotiated under the Obama administration but remained relatively insulated from President Trumps pattern of withdrawing from treaties and agreementspartly because of New STARTs continued bipartisan support within Congress, particularly from those who voted in favor of the treaty in 2010.\n\nA more politically-sound and -sustainable solution might be a congressional executive agreement that would require a simple majority vote in both the Senate and House.\n\nPlan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\n\nThe ideal option for maintaining transparency, predictability, and mutual limitations of US and Russian nuclear arsenals would be the conclusion of a follow-on treaty to replace New START. That is also the least feasible option, especially as bilateral talks have been placed on hold since Russia invaded Ukraine. Nonetheless, a thorough consideration of each countrys respective arms control priorities could yield some opportunities for common ground when negotiations eventually resume.\n\nIn June 2022, Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, Mallory Stewart, described the United States current arms control priorities vis--vis Russia as follows: \"We want to sustain limits beyond 2026 on the Russian systems covered under new START; we want to limit the new kinds of nuclear systems Russia is developing; and we want to address all Russian nuclear weapons, including theater-range weapons\" (Stewart 2022).\n\nPriority one: maintaining strategic limits after New START\n\nThe United States first prioritysustaining mutual limitations beyond 2026is likely to be shared by Russia. Both countries are aware of each others significant strategic upload capacities upon New STARTs expiration, such that each country could more than double their total deployed strategic war- heads in the absence of existing limitations (see \"The arms race in high gear\" section). However, neither side appears to have the political appetite or economic capacity to engage in a strategic arms buildup.\n\nRussias significant interest in preserving the bilateral arms control regime was on full display in the months and weeks leading up to New STARTs extension in 2021. As Andrey Baklitskiy wrote at the time for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace:\n\n\"Both chambers of parliament voted on the extension in just one day, and passed it unanimously. Such speed and consensuslast seen over the annexation of Crimea back in 2014shows how important arms control is to the Russian leadership. [. . .] Recently, it has become fashionable in Russias expert circles to opine that traditional arms control is obsolete as a concept, and doesnt correspond to the reality of the modern world. This view partly stems from the fact that existing treaties have disappeared one after the other, while Moscow has not held talks on a new one for more than a decade. The energy the Russian state has put into supporting arms control efforts, along with the first progress made on this front, could now put an end to that trend\" (Baklitskiy 2021).\n\nPriority two: addressing Russias \"exotic\" new nuclear systems\n\nThe United States second prioritylimiting Russias newer nuclear systemswill pose a greater challenge than maintaining the existing limits beyond 2026, but not an insurmountable one. In March 2018, President Putin unveiled a suite of \"exotic\" new nuclear systemsincluding the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, and the Status-6 Poseidon nuclear torpedoimmediately prompting concerns from US lawmakers that these systems would not be covered by New START limitations (President of Russia 2018; Cotton 2019).\n\nWhile some of these systems do pose arms control challenges, two of themSarmat and Avangardappear to be covered by the treaty. The New START protocols have clear provisions for including \"new types\" of strategic ICBMs within the framework of the treaty, and given that Sarmat has already been tested and is scheduled to be deployed by the end of 2022, Russia will have already provided many of the requisite prototype notifications to the United States (Al Jazeera 2022). In a similar vein, the United States incoming LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM will also enter the treaty smoothly.\n\nAdditionally, Avangard is not a particularly complex case: the hypersonic glide vehicle is carried by treaty-accountable ICBMs and the system itself meets New STARTs definition of a \"re-entry vehicle\" under the description \"that part of the front section that can survive reentry through the dense layers of the Earths atmosphere and that is designed for delivering a weapon to a target or for testing such a delivery\" (US Department of State 2010, 60(7)). As a result, any ICBMs deployed with the Avangard system are now counted toward the central limits for both launchers and warheads.\n\nBoth the United States and Russia seem to agree on how New START will consider these two systems. In 2019, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Andrea Thompson, stated in congressional testimony that: \"We assess at least two of them, the Sarmat heavy ICBM and Avangard hypersonic system would count as existing types and be subject to New START at the appropriate point in their development cycle\" (Thompson 2019). Six months later, the deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministrys nonproliferation and arms control department, Vladimir Leontiev, stated at the Valdai Discussion Club:\n\n\"As far as new Russian systems are concerned, the situation is dual. There are two systems that clearly fall under the treaty. First, the Sarmat, which can be easily included in the treaty as a new type ICBM (inter-continental ballistic missile), for which there is a special procedure, from the creation of a prototype to its authorization for service. [. . .] There are no big problems with Avangard, either, because it is an optional warhead for an ICBM of the corresponding type, to which the treaty applies, too. [. . .] The Avangard will enter the Treaty very smoothly\" (TASS 2019).\n\nThe statuses of the three other new Russian delivery systemsBurevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhalare less obvious. Neither Burevestnik nor Poseidon are likely to be deployed before New STARTs expiration in February 2026; however, it is worth examining whether any of these would fall under the treatys existing counting rules, given that these could form the basis for a potential follow-on agreement.\n\nArticle V of New START stipulates that: \"When a Party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging, that Party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the Bilateral Consultative Commission.\" The treatys supplementary protocol specifies what constitutes a \"new\" kind of strategic offensive weapon:\n\n\"The term new type means, for ICBMs or SLBMs, a type of ICBM or a type of SLBM, the technical characteristics of which differ from the technical characteristics of an ICBM or SLBM, respectively, of each type declared previously in at least one of the following respects: (a) Number of stages. (b) Type of propellant of any stage. (c) Either the length of the assembled missile without front section or the length of the first stage, by more than three percent. (d) Diameter of the first stage, by more than three percent\" (US Department of State 2010, 46(42)).\n\nIt is unclear whether this definition applies to any of Burevestnik, Poseidon, or Kinzhal, given that none could be considered ICBMs or SLBMs. Burevestnik is a cruise missile, Poseidon is a type of underwater torpedo, and Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile. Moreover, at least two of these systems do not travel on ballistic trajectories, placing them outside the treatys definition of either an \"intercontinental ballistic missile\" or a \"submarine-launched ballistic missile,\" regardless of their launch systems or strategic roles in Russias nuclear arsenal.\n\nHowever, in 2019, then-Under Secretary Thompson added during her congressional testimony that all three \"meet the US criteria for what constitutes a new kind of strategic offensive arms for purposes of New START\" (Thompson 2019).\n\nThis interpretation is not likely to be shared by Russia. In December 2018, Russian officials sent a notice to the United States stating that they \"find it inappropriate to characterize new weapons being developed by Russia that do not use ballistic trajectories of flight moving to a target as potential new kinds of Russian strategic offensive arms. The arms presented by the President of the Russian Federation on March 1, 2018, have nothing to do with the strategic offensive arms categories covered by the Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nIn its notice, Russia asserted that because none of the Burevestnik, Poseidon, and Kinzhal delivery systems are ICBMs, SLBMs, or heavy bombers, they fall outside the scope of the treaty. The statement also noted that \"the Russian approach to the issue of criteria for defining new kinds of strategic offensive arms for the purposes of this Treaty is being worked at. The Russian Side is open for dialogue on this topic although it does not consider it as a priority taking into account pressing issues of the Treaty implementation discussed currently in the Bilateral Consultative Commission\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nThe complex case for counting Kinzhal under the treaty framework depends entirely upon whether its carrier aircraft fits the treaty definition of an accountable \"heavy bomber.\" The treatys protocol states that an aircraft counts as a \"heavy bomber\" if it either (a) has a combat (meaning unrefueled) range of more than 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) or (b) is equipped for nuclear air-launched cruise missiles with a range exceeding 600 kilometers (370 miles) (US Department of State 2010, 23(80)). Given that Kinzhal is an air-launched ballistic missile, it does not satisfy the latter criterion. However, depending on how Russia intends to deploy the system, it could satisfy the former criterion.\n\nRussia deploys Kinzhal on its specially-modified MiG-31IK Foxhound aircraft and has used the system in combat at least three times during its invasion of Ukraine (Kristensen and Korda 2022a; TASS 2022). The MiG-31IKs combat range is estimated to be approximately 1,250 kilometers (770 miles)significantly below the 8,000-kilometer threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000a). As Pranay Vaddi, now Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, wrote in 2019 for Lawfare: \"In this case, Kinzhal would not be accountable under New START, and neither should it be. Because the MiG-31 has a very limited range, it is not, even when armed with Kinzhal, the kind of strategic weapon that New START was intended to limit. Rather, if Kinzhal is deployed on a MiG-31, it will likely fill a limited, theater-strike role\" (Vaddi 2019).\n\nHowever, news reports have indicated that Russia may also deploy Kinzhal on its longer-range Tu-22M3M Backfire bombers (TASS 2018; RIA Novosti 2018). The upgraded Tu-22M3Ms are currently not classified as \"heavy bombers\" under New START because they are estimated to have a combat range of approximately 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles), whichif correctremains below the 8,000-kilometer (4,971 miles) threshold (Federation of American Scientists 2000b). The United States raised concerns about the upgraded Tu-22M3M system to Russia in September 2018, to which Russia responded as follows:\n\n\"The Russian side indeed plans to carry out modernization of Tu-22M3 bomber to the modification Tu-22M3M. This modernization will prolong the service life of the aircraft, as well as improve its systems of maneuverability, navigation and use of air weapon systems. At the same time, the range of the bomber will be below 8000 km, and it will not be equipped for nuclear [air-launched cruise missiles] with range exceeding 600 km. Proceeding from the aforementioned facts, the technical characteristics of the Tu-22M3M aircraft in accordance with paragraph 23 (80) of Part One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty do not allow to classify it as a heavy bomber and it will not fall under the limitations of the New START Treaty\" (Russian Federation 2018).\n\nWhile the combat range of the upgraded Tu-22M3M may remain below 8,000 kilometers, it appears that the modernized aircraft will likely have probes to facilitate mid-air refueling (Interfax 2018). This is a significant alteration of the aircraft that will allow it to potentially reach intercontinental ranges. For this reason, these probes had been previously removed from Russias Tu-22M aircraft under the SALT II process, and the Soviet Union had made a politically binding declaration on July 31, 1991, that \"it will not give the Tu-22M airplane the capability of operating at intercontinental distances in any manner, including by in-flight refueling\" (Vance 1979; US Department of State 1991). However, this long-standing policy appears to now have been reversed, with defense sources telling Interfax in 2018 that: \"The new refueling equipment will significantly increase Tu-22M3Ms combat radius and range of operation. The range will be comparable with one of strategic bombers\" (Interfax 2018).\n\nWhile this may not technically trigger the reclassification of the Kinzhal/Tu-22M3M combination as a treaty-accountable \"heavy bomber\" given that the aircrafts unrefueled range is still likely to remain below the 8,000-kilometer threshold, the de facto transformation of a medium-range aircraft into an intercontinental-range aircraft could be enough for the United States to raise the matter at the BCC or in other bilateral forums. Moreover, in the context of negotiating a follow-on treaty, the United States could seek to close this potential loophole by addressing the fact that mid-flight refueling capabilities could theoretically turn a tactical bomber into a strategic one.\n\nPriority three: addressing all Russian nuclear weapons\n\nThe United States third prioritylimiting all of Russias nuclear weaponslikely poses the greatest challenge given the difficulty of verification and existing force asymmetry.\n\nThe United States is likely aware of the challenge, thus phrasing its goal to \"address all Russian nuclear weapons\" rather broadly. This could, for a start, be achieved through unverified data exchanges. Nonetheless, any negotiations that concern non-strategic nuclear warheads will be complicated by the asymmetry of Russia having up to 10 times more non-strategic nuclear warheads than the United States (1,912 compared to 200) (Kristensen and Korda 2022a, 2022b). Were Russia willing to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in a treaty, it would likely ask for US concessions in another area, although it has not specified so far what this might be. The Russian government did state, however, that a precondition for discussing non-strategic nuclear weapons is that the United States withdraws such weapons from Europe (Berestovaya 2021). Other areas of asymmetry Russia could try to pull into a negotiation package might concern US missile defenses and conventional weapons.\n\nExacerbated by existing political tensions and the current arms control deadlock between the two countries, this issue is not likely to be resolved anytime soon. Rather, an effort to include non-strategic nuclear weapons in an arms control treaty could require several years of negotiations and confidence-buildingpossibly spanning multiple presidential administrations.\n\nLessons learned and next steps\n\nTo address the challenges of building a follow-on framework, we now look at the lessons learned from previous arms control negotiations and identify strategies the United States might follow to eventually achieve a successful outcome.\n\nClarify national security interests and identify corresponding arms control tools\n\nIt is common wisdom that arms control is not an end in itself, but is instead a means to ensure national security. In this view, any future arms control negotiations need to be preceded by a thorough reevaluation of the national security interests they are meant to achieve. During the Cold War, arms control worked in tandem with deterrence and other elements of national power to manage strategic competition. When the Cold War ended, the role of arms control changed to a collaborative tool to manage, first, a controlled drawdown of excess strategic forces, then, deep cuts of nuclear forces, and eventually, elimination. With the pendulum swinging back to strategic competition, arms control may once again have to serve principally as a tool to manage strategic competition. It is therefore important to address expectations about what arms control can tangibly achieve in the coming years.\n\nAs noted above, US officials and leading nuclear scholars have repeatedly listed the following as problems that arms control should address: the loss of transparency with Russia, Chinas buildup, new weapons, risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation, and the deterioration of international norms. This section explores how the United States should prioritize these issues given the return to strategic competition, and which arms control tools it should rely on for each.\n\nFirst, with the war in Ukraine and the generally growing risk of regional conflicts involving China or Russia, the United States most pressing interest should be to minimize the risks of inadvertent or accidental escalation. The United States time would likely not be wasted here as ensuring \"nonevents\" constitutes \"a strong mutual interest among the United States, Russia, and China\" (Talmadge 2022). Besides addressing the root cause by cooperating to reduce regional tensions, nuclear experts and US-Russia military-to-military dialogues have emphasized a series of measures to help prevent escalation and eventual nuclear use: (1) maintain communication lines; (2) hold consultations on military operations and doctrine (to include provisions that would prevent escalation and rule out the first nuclear strike); (3) increase regular contacts between the two militaries (expanded to mid-level and regional commanders), including detailed notifications about intentions, threat perceptions, and potentially ambiguous exercises and operations; and (4) observe each others military exercises (Woolf 2021; Chalikyan 2021). Given Putins escalatory language regarding Ukraine, these measureswhich luckily do not require a formal treatycannot wait any further. In the short term, they would complement New START. In the intermediate term, they would provide some limited, but much-needed confidence should there be no immediate follow-on treaty. In the longer term, risk reduction efforts may \"create opportunities for the parties to address and resolve those security concerns that are blocking the path to nuclear disarmament\" (Woolf 2021).\n\nSecond, the United States should prioritize preventing the loss of transparency regarding Russian strategic nuclear weapons as these continue to comprise most nuclear weapons that can reach the US homeland. In the medium-term, these are still owned by Russia, not China. New STARTs verification and monitoring regime continues to be a highly suitable tool in this regard, because it allows the United States to track the numbers, types, sizes, locations, readiness, and movements of these weapons. This information helps avoid misunderstandings and worst-case planning assumptions that would otherwise fuel a new arms race. It would therefore be in the United States best interest to continue a similar mutual verification and monitoring regime of offensive strategic nuclear forces. For non-strategic nuclear weapons, data declarations would likely be the most suitable transparency tool to address the United States concerns for now. Issues surrounding intrusiveness and feasibility make a fully verifiable framework for these weapons rather difficult absent the necessary political will.\n\nThird, given the US bipartisan concern with Russian treaty violations and the resulting deterioration of international norms, it is within US interest to revitalize the latter. The value of any future arms control treaty or agreement diminishes if it becomes common practice to simply violate them or exit them on a whim. Therefore, to ensure that arms control negotiations are worth the effort and that their value does not disappear overnight, it will be essential to revive international norms surrounding nonproliferation. This could be achieved through bilateral and multilateral normative statements, use of doctrine and strategy dialogues, as well as various tools to increase exit costsincluding treaty provisions and allied, or ideally multilateral, commitments to sanction noncompliant parties.\n\nFinally, how do the traditional tools of arms controllimitations and reductionshold up today? Deep numerical reductions are unlikely without Russian and Chinese participation, given the level of prior reductions, expectations of cheating, and especially the new geopolitical order with Chinas growing military power and nuclear arsenal. However, all three countries need to do their best to overcome these forces as soon as possible and fulfill their disarmament obligations under the NPT. Regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons thatunlike strategic weaponsdo not pose a direct threat to each countrys homeland, reductions would not solve the most pressing concern: escalation through first use in a regional, conventional conflict (such as in Ukraine). Any remaining nuclear warheads could still be used first and risk escalation. For this reason, it is important to realize that reductions themselves should be a longer-term interest, and need to be complemented by other arms control tools such as the ones mentioned earlier. More immediate concerns regarding non-strategic nuclear weapons would be better addressed through risk reduction tools, transparency measures, and the strengthening of international norms.\n\nDespite the limitations of traditional arms control tools, however, the United States (and Russia) would continue to benefit from the force predictability if limits on launchers and warheads remained. Opponents of arms control have for a long time tried to argue that these limits lead to decreased deterrence because it makes the United States reduce its nuclear forces while Russia keeps proportionally investing more into modernizing theirs (Trachtenberg 2021, 7). But changes in deterrence are largely the result of countries having different military doctrines rather than the treaties provisions. For instance, Russia relies more on its nuclear arsenal given its conventional forces inferiority. Today, given the ongoing modernization of the US nuclear triad and its higher number of strategic launchers and larger inventory of strategic nuclear warheads, the United States should feel confident that its deterrent will be preserved in respect to Russia under continued limits on launchers and warheads.\n\nThe key challenge is how Chinas growing nuclear arsenal will affect these numerical and qualitative assessments of the US-Russian balance. Is the credibility of the US nuclear deterrent reduced because of Chinas buildup? Will it undermine the US-Russian balance? If the United States increases its nuclear arsenal, will that cause either Russia or China to increase theirs even more? \"The challenge will then be to redress Russias and Chinas worst-case assessments that the capabilities the United States deploys to deter both countries could or would be used to defeat either one of them. If new approaches to arms control cannot be invented, the world is likely to see worsening security dilemmas, arms racing, and instability\" (Dalton et al. 2022, 13).\n\nBeyond that, future negotiators will likely want to focus on issues other than simple numerical reductions of launchers and warheads, such as the asymmetry in the nuclear production complexesthe roots of the nuclear warhead tree (Albertson 2022, 66). China, concerned about the survivability of its nuclear forces, may be reluctant to agree to fissile material production cut-offs. Because these concerns are partially driven by US missile defenses, it might, however, be open to combining this issue with a moratorium on the deployment of space-based missile defenses, the most plausible means for the United States to undermine Chinas nuclear deterrent (Acton, MacDonald, and Vaddi 2021, 5152).\n\nBuild arms control expertise\n\nTo have any chance at preventing the loss of strategic arms controls benefits and develop remedies to safeguard strategic stability, the US government will need to make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise.\n\nOne important factor that contributed to the arms control achievements in the mid-1980s to 1990s was the amount of expertise in the executive and legislative branches. Those who lived through the Cold War were naturally more concerned with, and educated on, nuclear weapons issues. Moreover, Congress still took its role in foreign policy seriously, and the Senate engaged in arms control through the bipartisan Arms Control Observer Group. For instance, Senate members of this group were tasked to consult with and advise US arms control negotiating teams, and \"to monitor and report to the Senate on the progress and development of negotiations\" (Roth 2014).\n\nToday, however, most of these arms control experts in the executive branch and Senate have retired or in other ways moved on. Current staff has not been able to benefit from the direct experience and on-the-job training of the negotiating, ratification, implementation, and verification processes. The New START Treaty negotiations were the last to benefit from the contributions of the remaining experts and champions from this era (Albertson 2021, 78). The Senate, while still somewhat engaged in the New START negotiations through the National Security Working Group, has largely lost the expertise from the days of the more-engaged Senate Arms Control Observer Groupdue to increased partisanship, diminished prestige, and the GOPs growing skepticism of legally binding international commitments (Roth 2014).\n\nTo regain the interest and expertise needed to think through todays arms control issues, the US government should (1) make significant staffing, training, and retention investments; and (2) increase cooperation and exchange between Congress and the executive branch again. The latter could be achieved possibly through a revitalized congressionally-appointed liaison group as former Sen. Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz previously proposed (Nunn and Moniz 2017).\n\nAlthough much of the deep technical expertise needed to develop effective arms control tools will require access to classified information, these efforts can, to some degree, be pursued in concert with civil society. External funding provided by foundations and philanthropic organizations has traditionally played an instrumental role in hiring, training, and empowering future generations of arms control experts. Many of these experts typically rotate through government at some point during their careers, and they rely on their external networks to both brainstorm new arms control ideas and build support for them in the public discourse. To that end, increased funding for civil society could play a pivotal role in fostering the deep bench of political and technical experts needed to pursue successful arms control negotiations in the future.\n\nDemonstrate Presidential leadership\n\nIt is likely that the chances of any follow-up agreement will be closely related to the degree of presidential lea-dership, support, and involvement in the negotiations, even if such an agreement is ratified in Congress and is not an executive agreement. It is essential to articulate national security objectives at the highest level as soon as possible in the process. If leaders are engaged throughout, the rest of the government will set it as a priority (Gottemoeller 2021, 172).\n\nRose Gottemoeller, the US lead negotiator of New START, assesses that the greatest asset to the treatys negotiations was the willingness of both US President Barack Obama and Russia President Dmitry Medvedev to engageand to use their knowledge about treaty issues. The opening of the New START formal negotiations can arguably be attributed to a US-Russian presidential joint statement that laid out the subject and scope of the new agreement. Two months after the first round of meetings, another presidential joint understanding that contained limit ranges likely enabled the negotiators to operate at a relatively quick pace.\n\nMoreover, there was great and important progress when President Obama and President Medvedev agreed on final warhead and delivery vehicle limits during a side meeting at the 2009 Climate Summit in Copenhagen (Gottemoeller 2021, 46, 89, 91). Throughout these and other arms control negotiations, Russian negotiators have in the past been more likely to consider concrete proposals when they came from a presidential level.\n\nFinally, given the Russians skills at slow-rolling, both presidents agreeing on the same timeline was vital to the relatively timely success of the New START negotiations.\n\nPresidential backing, first, ignited the talks and, second, saved much time by allowing the negotiators to focus on the agreed-upon scope. In the context of a future follow-on agreement, it could be possible to negotiate a technical framework using interagency guidance before any public summit if the political environment is too challenging. It is clear that presidential leadership throughout the New START negotiations provided the delegations on both sides with the needed bureaucratic firepower to get things done quickly, and helped move negotiations along when they were seemingly stuck.\n\nUnderstand the other side: Russia\n\nOn the Russian side, it is critical to understand the role that nuclear weapons play in their politics, military strategy, andperhaps most importantlyits perception of itself as a nation (Williams 2016). Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, describes well the crucial role of such an understanding in a report describing his unprecedented visits to Russias nuclear complex in 1992:\n\n\"We quickly discovered that the Russian view of its nuclear enterprise could not have been more radically different than the prevailing American view. Our Russian colleagues and the nuclear ministry viewed their nuclear weapons and nuclear complex as the crowning achievement of Soviet times and essential to Russias political, scientific, and economic future. With Russias conventional forces having atrophied, nuclear weapons were viewed as their guarantor of sovereignty, assuring Moscow a seat at the international table. Nuclear materials were seen as an economic resource and a national treasure. Nuclear experts and their scientific institutions were seen as an engine for the recovery of the national economy\" (Hecker 2017, 6).\n\nIn the 30 years since these visits, Russias view of its nuclear enterprise has not changed much, particularly considering the poor performance of its conventional forces in conflicts, epitomized by its current war against Ukraine. But perhaps surprisingly, this imbalance may be a boon for arms control given that Russia has typically viewed its participation in such negotiations as evidence of its \"great power\" status. Additionally, Russia may view a renewed arms control agreement as a pathway toward renegotiating the global geopolitical order on its own terms. As a result, Russia is likely to view arms control in a relatively positive light compared to other nuclear-armed states like China.\n\nAlthough Russia is likely to be relatively amenable to the prospect of nuclear negotiations (as suggested by their quick extension of New START in 2021), they, like the United States, will not enter into agreements unless these serve their national security interests. Several key Russian security concerns may need to be addressed to ensure a successful follow-on agreement.\n\nChief among these concerns is the development of advanced US missile defenses. Russia has long regarded the limitation of anti-ballistic missiles as the \"cornerstone of strategic stability,\" and has often explicitly characterized missile defense limits as a precondition to strategic arms control. In 2000, President Vladimir Putin noted that \"the mutual reduction of strategic attack weapons . . . is possible only when the ABM Treaty continues to hold\" (Woolf 2002). Additionally, throughout the New START negotiations, Russian negotiators attempted on several occasions to bring the issue of missile defense to the tableparticularly following pressure from Putin, for whom missile defense was a priority issue (Gottemoeller 2021, 97).\n\nGiven the advancements in US defensive capabilities and Putin being back in the presidential seat today, it is likely that Russia will continue pressing the issue of US missile defenses. As Russia has historically been highly effective at drawing out negotiations, they may initially insist again on US concessions in this areabut they should hopefully recognize that it would not be worth jeopardizing strategic offensive arms control over the issue.\n\nIf Russia refuses to yield, however, the United States could again offer to place some limits on its missile defenses as part of a negotiation. At present, the US missile defense architecture appears to be an ever-evolving, open-ended projectrather than a clearly-defined effort to reach specific deterrence objectives. This has been recently underscored by increasingly blurred lines between theater and homeland defenses, as well as President Trumps assertion that US missile defense will continue to evolve to \"detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere, anytime, anyplace\" (Sonne 2019). These factors likely validate the concerns of Russian strategists who largely never believed previous US assurances about the limited nature of their defenses (Woolf 2002).\n\nTo that end, the United States could consider establishing clear goals and limitations for its missile defense architecture, clearly communicate them to Russia, and then assess which constraints would be acceptable to unblock the path toward strategic arms control. Such constraints would not necessarily have to affect existing US capabilities but could involve placing a cap on interceptors at a higher level than what is currently deployed (Arbatov 2021). Given Chinas similar concerns about US defenses, such actions could potentially also help bring China to the negotiating table.\n\nFinally, regarding one of the United States core concernsnonstrategic nuclear weaponsRussia has so far repeatedly posed preconditions to even begin talks that have been perceived as a pretext to avoid negotiations: the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and the elimination of NATOs nuclear-sharing arrangements and related infrastructure. While the Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons posture has been transitioning to a combination of assets in support of specific missions, the Russian military, political leadership, and elites still believe that Russia needs a larger non-strategic nuclear weapons force than does NATO. This is primarily because Russia sees its non-strategic nuclear weapons to some extent as compensation for the larger US strategic nuclear arsenal.\n\nBecause Russia is unlikely to agree to equal ceiling and intrusive verification measures, a phased approach starting with transparency measures would be more promising. However, Russia might be susceptible to an effort to put its 2020 political commitment to freeze its nuclear stockpile back on the table (Pomper et al. 2022, 4647). In the longer term, to overcome Russias perceived need to compensate for having less strategic nuclear weapons, actual reductions might need to wait for future negotiations including the United Kingdom, France, and China (against whom Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons could be used in a strategic way).\n\nUnderstand the other side: China\n\nThe Chinese side is more difficult to understand. First, China has never engaged in nuclear arms control talks with the United Statesunlike Russia, with which the United States has half a century of experience. Second, while China formally maintains a no-first-use policy, doctrinal debates are still ongoing about the limits of this policy (Leveringhaus 2022). To make matters worse, the security concerns related to the two countrys growing competition have restricted opportunities for US-Chinese academic exchanges that would allow the United States to better understand Chinas goals and doctrine (Zhao 2021).\n\nWhat seems clear, however, is that it would be almost impossible to include China in an immediate follow-on treaty to New START. First, the remaining time until February 2026 is not enough to include an entirely new negotiating partner with whom no such negotiating history or relations exist. Notably, it took the United States and Russia decades to get to their first verifiable arms control treaty. Second, Chinese officials have explicitly and repeatedly rejected joining arms limitation talks and previously suggested that they will join such negotiations only after the \"huge gap\" between their arsenal and the US and Russian nuclear arsenals has been closed. Until then, however, they have signaled that they stand ready to discuss \"all issues related to strategic stability and nuclear risk reduction in the framework of P5, [the UN Security Councils five permanent members, including] China, Russia, US, UK, and France\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peoples Republic of China 2020).\n\nChina likely perceives time to be on its side and is probably waiting until it gains the needed leverage to become a more equal negotiating partner in this area. The projected increase in the size of the Chinese nuclear arsenalperhaps with up to 1,000 warheads by 2030 (US Department of Defense 2021, 90) and potentially as many ICBMs as each of the United States and Russiacould potentially create new opportunities for arms control discussions around the end of this decade. But, even then, China is unlikely to agree to strategic arms control limits until it feels confident enough in its nuclear forces continued survivability. Moreover, China has traditionally relied on secrecy and opacity to help safeguard its smaller nuclear arsenal (Riqiang 2016). It would have to accept some degree of transparency to join a verifiable arms control regime like the New START treaty.\n\nMeanwhile, to make any progress, the United States should continue to explore the following questions: What are the lessons from previous nuclear dialogues with China that may form the basis for future joint efforts? A previous track 1.5 dialogue (a term of art to describe situations in which both official and non-official actors cooperate) with China clarified that China, seeking recognition for its prominent role in the new international order, is interested in discussing a \"new paradigm of strategic stabilityone not built around deterrent threats, especially nuclear blackmailbut broader ideals of cooperation and mutual respect \" (Santoro and Gromoll 2020, 11). The United States needs to therefore think about possible ways to make China feel this interest is being addressed while preserving its national security priorities.\n\nMoreover, Chinas strategic stability concerns all center around the fear that the United States might be after \"absolute security,\" looking to overcome mutual vulnerability. Therefore, the current and future US administrations should consider tools to build confidence in this area with China. Even if informal and on a track 1.5 basis, these could eventually lay the groundwork for a first treaty with China.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for cooperation with China, the United States should also explore the following questions: Is there any room for the United States and China to slowly start exchanging certain types of information about each others strategic nuclear forces, in particular those types about which China might not feel as protective? What would the United States be prepared to offer China in exchange for limits on Chinese nuclear forces? Is a more creative French-style approach to negotiations neededthat offers to combine unrelated issues, which in Chinas case would include tariffs, special economic zones, and other economic issues? How can the United States best leverage the P5 forum for risk reduction with China?\n\nMake long-term investments\n\nBecause of the difficulty of achieving the United States current objectives, especially the inclusion of China, in a follow-on treaty, it is advisable to develop and pursue a long-term strategy for achieving these goals. Given the current geopolitical context, a treaty covering Chinese strategic nuclear forces might not happen until the 2030s when China feels secure enough in its nuclear deterrent capability and negotiation leverage.\n\nTo be ready once the other side agrees to talk, the United States should start making the following long-term investments. First, it should develop its positions on priority demands and possible concessions it would be willing to make in negotiations with both Russia and China. Second, it should explore all possibilities for the national laboratories to engage in technical verification exchanges and preparations with both Russia and China to ensure technical details will be ready once circumstances are ripe for new treaties and agreements. Additionally, to increase cooperation with China that may lead to more cooperation in the area, the United States may consider offering early warning training to China which is intensively developing its early warning capability. Something similar was considered for Russia during the Cold War and would have the added benefit of reducing miscalculation risks. Finally, the United States should view even unfruitful negotiations as a means to build and maintain arms control negotiation expertiseas well as to uphold communication channelsuntil a treaty can be successfully negotiated and concluded.\n\nGet the militarys support\n\nHaving the militarys support is key to both negotiations and ratification. First, the US Department of Defense is one of the most important US interagency stakeholders, and the interagencys support has proven crucial during negotiations. During the New START negotiations, Gottemoeller assesses the strong Pentagon support to be one of the core factors in the negotiations success (Gottemoeller 2021, 96). Getting the two top military leaders together helped overcome institutional resistance in each military bureaucracy (Gottemoeller 2021, 70). US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen and Russian Gen. Makarov, by simply agreeing on the main issues and their priority, gave the Russian delegations military members a high-level boost within the Russian Ministry of Defense for working the details (Gottemoeller 2021, 74).\n\nSecond, the militarys support increases the chances of ratification. Many senators simply do not wish to be on the record for voting against the military.\n\nThe militarys support is best achieved primarily by listening to and addressing its concerns. In the New START negotiations, for instance, the US military services were worried about the costs of elimination procedures and the operational interruptions due to inspections (Gottemoeller 2021, 63). The negotiators focus and dedication toward this issue helped ensure their support. Moreover, involving the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as much as possible throughout the negotiations can be key in this effort too as it will make the military feel like it partially owned the process.\n\nFuture arms control will have to solve several problems for the US military. First, old problems that are likely to resurface without a follow-on to the New START Treaty should not be discounted. These concern primarily the lack of constraints on Russian nuclear forces which would incentivize a new arms race and the costs of the additionally-needed intelligence collection and analysis in the absence of a verification mechanism. In fact, after the New START Treatys executive extension in 2021, US Gen Hyten, who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to 2021, expressed his and other Department of Defense officials support of the treaty especially because of its nuclear weapons limits and verification process (Vergun 2021).\n\nAdditionally, the amount of military backing is likely to increase with the number of new problems the negotiations manage to address. Gen. Hyten is one of many Department of Defense officials to reiterate that new Russian weapons and Chinas buildup are increasingly posing strategic problems for the US military (Vergun 2021). Addressing these issues in some form or another through future arms control approaches would likely help this US administration, or the next, get the necessary military support. Moreover, maintaining deterrence through a strong nuclear triad has historically been a strong military interestalthough there is reasonable debate on what is needed in this regard. Overall, it is advisable to frame any future arms control approaches within a framework that seeksand getsthe militarys support.\n\nGain bipartisan support\n\nTo be sustainable, a follow-on agreement would need broad bipartisan support to remain insulated from politicization. This is particularly critical given the likelihood of political fluctuation in the House, Senate, and presidency over the coming years. New STARTs survival throughout the Trump administrations pattern of treaty withdrawals can be partially attributed to continued bipartisan support within Congressincluding from senators who initially voted in favor of the treaty in 2010 and remained in Congress throughout that tumultuous period.\n\nTo that end, a follow-on agreement must address the concerns of both major political parties, the Democrats and Republicans. Chief among these are concerns over breakout potential and verification.\n\nOne prominent critique of New START is that it could incentivize warhead uploading in a crisis because both parties are permitted to retain an unlimited number of non-deployed strategic warheads (Smith 2020). As discussed earlier, both countries do indeed have a significant upload capacity and could more than double their number of deployed warheads if necessary. However, a potential breakout scenario is likely to be more of a Russian concern than a US one: given that the United States has a larger number of empty launch spots on its missiles than Russia does, the United States has a significantly larger upload capacity. As a result, a potential breakout capacity should be more of a fear for Russia than for the United States, making the prospect of a Russian breakout unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, even though a significant upload would accelerate the arms race, it may not necessarily affect strategic stability between the United States and Russia. In 2012, a joint report by the Department of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to Congress noted that: \"The Russian Federation . . . would not be able to achieve a militarily significant advantage by any plausible expansion of its strategic nuclear forces, even in a cheating or breakout scenario under the New START Treaty, primarily because of the inherent survivability of the planned US strategic force structure, particularly the OHIO-class ballistic missile submarines, a number of which are at sea at any given time\" (US Department of Defense 2012). This argument could potentially be used in the future to mitigate fears among US policy makers of a future breakout scenario.\n\nAnother critique of New START centers around the treatys verification regimespecifically, that a limited number of on-site inspections may not be enough to verify compliance with the treatys central limits on deployed warheads. As explained by Bryan Smith, a senior fellow at the George Mason Universitys National Security Institute:\n\n\"[E]ven if a US inspection revealed that a particular missile was loaded with a number larger than Russia had declared, there is no logical way to infer from thisor any such discrepancythat the entire force had exceeded the 1,550 warhead limit. Conversely, neither could we logically conclude that the entire force complied with the 1,550 limit, even if the 20-30 percent lifetime sample inspections all confirmed that the observed warhead loadings matched their declarations.\" (Smith 2020)\n\nGiven Russias pattern of violating arms control agreements, such concerns should be taken seriously. Yet, perfect verificationthat is, accurate and exhaustiveis not necessary for the success of an agreement. Rather, the United States should be satisfied with ensuring Paul Nitzes definition of effective verification that \"if the other side moves beyond the limits of the treaty in any militarily significant way, we would be able to detect such violations in time to respond effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of the violation\" (Nitze 1988).\n\nIt is therefore possible for the United States to achieve effective verification of a treaty through limited on-site inspections. Ivan Oelrich, a former vice president of the Federation of American Scientists, comprehensively addressed the prospect of Russian cheating in 2010:\n\n\"Say the Russians wanted to cheat by putting more warheads than allowed on, say, 10% of their missiles. [. . .] They would have to put the warheads on missiles and then lie on the data exchange and hope they dont get caught. So, if we pick our inspection sites randomly, then there is a 10% chance they will get caught in one inspection and a 90% chance they will get away without detection on that one inspection. But there is only an 81% chance of getting past two inspections, 73% chance away with three, and so on. If we do 10 inspections, there is a 2/3 chance we will catch a violation of only a 10% cheat, hardly odds that would appeal to a prospective cheater. There is a 90% chance we would catch a 20% cheat. Just in the first 10 inspections. Remember that inspections continue over the years and our confidence will increase over time, approaching near certainty that even small violations will be detected by the time the warhead limits are reached\" (Oelrich 2010).\n\nAs a result, to alleviate these broader political concerns over verification, the United States should aim to incorporate a sufficient number of on-site inspections into any follow-on agreement. A rough calculation to determine an acceptable number of inspections can be derived, as done above, by estimating the percentage of missiles where Russia will try to cheat and selecting a confidence percentage of acceptable risk. The formula is expressed as follows: 1-x = yz, where x is the desired confidence percentage, y is the likelihood of not catch- ing a cheating Russia during each independent inspection, and z is the number of necessary inspections.\n\nFor example, if the United States suspects that Russia could try to cheat with 10 percent of its missiles, then it will need at least 21 inspections to achieve a 90 percent confidence rating that Russia is not cheating at that rate. It would need at least 28 inspections to achieve a 95 percent confidence rating, and at least 229 inspections to achieve a 99 percent confidence rating. The desired confidence rating, coupled with an educated assessment of Russias capability and intent to cheat, will help determine how many on-site inspections would be sufficient to verify an agreement. However, these will need to again be carefully weighed with the militarys operational costs and sensitivity concerns. Due to the US Senates concerns about Russian cheating and the return to great power competition since New STARTs negotiations, the right balance might end up requiring a higher confidence rating today.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnless both Russia and the United States soon put in proportional efforts to overcome the political forces stalling meaningful dialogue, February 5, 2026, will be the first day since 1972 without substantive, verifiable limits on the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals.\n\nRussia and the United States would lose mutual predictability, and military planners would have to consider an increased worst-case scenario, starting with the possible upload of nearly doubleor possibly more, in the case of the United Statesthe total number of warheads on strategic delivery vehicles. Both sides would inevitably accelerate defense spending, resulting in an even more costly and unstable arms race.\n\nTo preserve bilateral arms control in these times of strategic competition, the United States and Russia should consider and prepare for several options, with trade-offs between feasibility and ambition: continued adherence through mutual moratoria the negotiation of a new executive agreement, and the conclusion of an entirely new treaty. The first two options have the benefit of not requiring legislative approval. However, their value would depend on the amount of political will on both sides to legally enable continued verification and refrain from cheating or exiting the agreement. At the same time, the United States and Russia need to carefully examine and prioritize their underlying interests for the option of a follow-on treaty. Even if a follow-on treaty fails to be ready by February 2026, strategic arms control treaty history has demonstrated that there are reasonable options for bridging treaty-less periods.\n\nThe history of treaty negotiations informs the next steps for the US government: (1) re-evaluate the full box of arms control tools in the light of strategic competition, (2) make significant, long-term investments into rebuilding the relevant expertise, (3) understand Russian and Chinese strategic priorities, (4) ensure readiness to negotiate once Russia and eventually China agree to talk, (5) get the militarys support, (6) ensure presidential leadership, and (7) gain bipartisan support. The best practices for each of these steps should help guide the next generation of arms control champions and ensure that the United States, Russia, and China can temper the most dangerous impulses of geopolitical competition and pursue their mutual security priorities through strategic arms control.\n\n(Editors note: The text on pages 354 and 355 of the PDF version of this articlestarting from one paragraph above the subheading \"Plan B: pursuing and executive agreement\" and ending at the subheading \"Plan A: negotiating an Article II follow-on treaty\"has been corrected for issues of fact.)",

Ukraine said it shot most of those missiles down, but some had hit power stations, knocking out electricity and water supplies.\n\n7:11pm: Russia's Wagner group facing UK court action over Ukraine 'terrorism'\n\nLawyers in Britain on Tuesday took the first step towards what they said was \"groundbreaking\" legal action against Russia's shadowy Wagner group over allegations it committed \"terrorism\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe proposed legal action is aimed at uncovering billions of dollars in reparations for victims of the mercenary fighters.\n\nWagner emerged in 2014 in Ukraine and is suspected by the West of doing the Kremlin's dirty work in countries such as Syria and the Central African Republic -- a charge Russia has always denied.\n\nJason McCue, senior partner at McCue Jury and Partners, said Wagner and its alleged boss Yevgeny Prigozhin \"engaged in a campaign of terrorism\" in Ukraine including murder, rape, the targeting of infrastructure and the planting of explosives around nuclear facilities.\n\n\"Their purpose was to spread terror and chaos in Ukraine,\" he told Britain's House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian officials have said Wagner has been sending thousands of soldiers recruited in Russian prisons to the front line, with the promise of a salary and an amnesty.\n\n6:20pm: No grain ship movement planned in Black Sea Wednesday, says coordination centre\n\nThere are no plans for grain-laden vessels to move in the Black Sea Wednesday, the Joint Coordination Centre, the body overseeing a deal to export Ukrainian foodstuffs, said.\n\n\"The UN Secretariat at the Joint Coordination Centre reports that the Ukrainian, Turkish and United Nations delegations agreed not to plan any movement of vessels in the Black Sea Grain Initiative for 2 November,\" it said Tuesday, referring to the July deal brokered by Turkey and the UN.\n\n6:15pm: Putin tells Erdogan he wants 'real guarantees' from Kyiv on grain deal, says Kremlin\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan Tuesday that he wanted \"real guarantees\" from Kyiv before it potentially rejoined the grain deal.\n\nPutin told Erdogan in a phone call that Russia sought \"real guarantees from Kyiv about the strict observance of the Istanbul agreement, in particular about not using the humanitarian corridor for military purposes\", according to a statement from the Kremlin.\n\n3:51pm: France says Russia endangering world food security\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accused Russia of endangering world food supplies by suspending its participation in a landmark Ukraine grain deal.\n\nMoscow on Saturday halted its participation in the agreement that allowed vital grain exports from Ukraine, blaming drone attacks on Russian ships in the Crimea.\n\nIn a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Macron \"denounced a unilateral decision by Russia which again harms global food security\", the president's office said.\n\nRussia made the announcement after its army accused Kyiv of a \"massive\" drone attack on its Black Sea fleet, which Ukraine labelled a \"false pretext\" and the UN urged the deal's preservation.\n\nThe July deal to unlock grain exports signed between Russia and Ukraine and brokered by Turkey and the UN has been seen as critical to easing the global food crisis caused by the conflict.\n\n3:18pm: Macron says France will help Ukraine get through winter, fix infrastructure\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, following a telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said France would help Ukraine get through the winter and help repair water and energy infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes.\n\nFrance will also help boost Ukraine's anti-air defences and Macron said he and Zelensky had agreed to hold an international conference in Paris on December 13 to support Ukraine civilians in winter.\n\nA bilateral conference on December 12 will also aim at raising support for Ukraine from French companies, Macron said in a statement.\n\n3:13pm: Macron, Zelensky discuss Ukraine's defence needs, restoring energy facilities\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday he had an \"extremely important and productive conversation\" with French President Emmanuel Macron about strengthening Ukraine's defence capabilities and restoring damaged energy infrastructure.\n\nZelensky did not say what had been agreed but thanked Macron for his support since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nExtremely important and productive conversation with President @EmmanuelMacron. Specific decisions on strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. Specific initiatives to restore the destroyed energy infrastructure. Thank you, my friend, for your unwavering support. (@ZelenskyyUa) November 1, 2022\n\n1:54pm: Britain says won't be drawn into Russian distractions over Nord Stream\n\nMoscows claim that Britain is to blame for damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines is an attempt to distract from the situation in Ukraine and is part of the \"Russian playbook\", Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Obviously, were carefully monitoring the situation, but it is right to not be drawn into these sorts of distractions which is part of the Russian playbook,\" Sunaks spokesman told reporters.\n\n\"They continue their indiscriminate bombardment of civilians and attacks on civilian infrastructure. That is our focus, and we will continue to provide support so that they lose this illegal war.\"\n\n12:04pm Kremlin accuses UK of directing and coordinating Nord Stream blasts\n\nThe Kremlin on Tuesday again accused the United Kingdom of \"directing and coordinating\" explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\n\"Our intelligence services have data indicating that British military specialists were directing and coordinating the attack,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. \"There is evidence that Britain is involved in sabotage, in a terrorist attack on vital energy infrastructure, not just Russian, but international.\"\n\n11:46am: Russia says no decree needed to end partial mobilisation in Ukraine\n\nThe Kremlin on Tuesday said it needed no decree to mark the completion of its \"partial mobilisation\" of 300,000 reservists to the war in Ukraine.\n\nBut the fact that the Kremlin has not rescinded the original presidential decree or issued a new one cancelling it has raised concerns that it may be keeping the door open to further call-ups.\n\n11:06am: EU presidency says sanctions may next target Belarus\n\nThe Czech prime minister, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said Tuesday the bloc may look at further sanctions on Belarus over its role in the war in Ukraine.\n\nMinsk allows Russian troops to be stationed on Belarusian territory and stage attacks on Ukraine from there, although it insists it does not want to join the war directly.\n\n\"We are now looking at... the role of Belarus and the potential need to target it,\" Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told reporters after returning from Kyiv where members of his cabinet joined him in talks with Ukrainian counterparts.\n\n\"We must realise that the attacks on Ukraine are led out of the Belarusian airspace and that Belarus supplies weapons to Russia,\" said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky.\n\n>> Russian pressure is too strong: Is Putin pulling Belarus into the war in Ukraine?\n\n10:23am: Three more ships leave Ukraine ports under deal despite Russian suspension\n\nThree outbound vessels left Ukrainian ports by midday on Tuesday under the Black Sea grain export deal, the United Nations-led coordination centre said, the second day of sailings after Russia suspended participation in the initiative.\n\nThe statement said the ships' movement was agreed by the Ukrainian, Turkish and UN delegations at the Istanbul-based centre and the Russian delegation had been informed.\n\nIt said the UN coordinator for the grain initiative, Amir Abdulla, continued discussions with all three member state parties in an effort to resume full participation at the centre that oversees safe passage of vessels.\n\n10:17am: Finland urges Turkey, Hungary to swiftly approve Swedish, Finnish NATO bids\n\nFinland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Tuesday urged Hungary and Turkey to swiftly approve the Swedish and Finnish applications for membership of the NATO defence alliance.\n\nHungary and Turkey are the only two remaining NATO members not to have ratified the applications.\n\n\"All eyes are now on Hungary and Turkey. We are waiting for these countries to ratify our applications. I think it would be important that this would happen preferably sooner than later,\" Marin told a joint news conference with other Nordic leaders.\n\nFinland and Sweden last week reiterated they would join NATO at the same time, presenting a united front to Turkey.\n\nThe Nordic neighbours asked to join the NATO alliance in May in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but ran into objections from Turkey which has accused the two of harbouring groups it deems terrorists.\n\n9:34am: Ukraine seeks Russia's expulsion from G20, says Putin's hands 'stained in blood'\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies and President Vladimir Putins invitation to a G20 summit in Bali next month must be revoked.\n\n\"Putin publicly acknowledged ordering missile strikes on Ukrainian civilians and energy infrastructure,\" spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"With his hands stained in blood, he must not be allowed to sit at the table with world leaders. Putins invitation to Bali summit must be revoked, and Russia expelled from G20.\"\n\n8:19am: Water, power supplies restored in Kyiv after missile strikes\n\nWater and electricity supplies have been restored in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, a day after being knocked out by Russian missile strikes, the city's mayor said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Water supplies to the homes of Kyiv residents have been fully restored.... Electricity supplies in Kyiv have also been restored\", Vitali Klitschko said on social media.\n\n8:08am: Russian missiles hit apartment complex in Mykolaiv\n\nRussia fired four missiles into the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv overnight, demolishing half an apartment building and killing one resident, a day after it unleashed a barrage of missiles on several cities including the capital Kyiv.\n\nRescue workers recovered the body of an elderly woman from the rubble of the apartment block early on Tuesday, Reuters witnesses said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said missile strikes on several Ukrainian cities on Monday which targeted infrastructure and a decision to freeze participation in a Black Sea grain export programme were responses to a drone attack on Moscows fleet in Crimea that he blamed on Ukraine.\n\n7:24am: Turkey says Black Sea grain export deal needs to be kept separate from war in Ukraine\n\nTurkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told Ukraines defence and infrastructure ministers that keeping the Black Sea grain export deal going was important and that, as a humanitarian initiative, it should be kept separate from the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nAkars comments, released in a statement by his ministry on Tuesday, followed Russias suspension of its participation in the deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July and aimed at keeping food commodities flowing to world markets.\n\nAkar also told his Russian counterpart on Monday that Moscow should re-evaluate its decision.\n\n7:15am: Russia extends evacuation zone in Kherson region\n\nRussian-installed officials in Ukraines southern Kherson region late Monday said they were extending an evacuation zone further from the Dnipro river, saying Ukraine could be preparing to attack the Kakhovka dam and flood the region.\n\nIn a post on Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-backed head of the region which is partially occupied by Russian forces, said he was extending the area covered by an order for civilians to evacuate by an additional 15 kilometres to include another seven settlements.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AP, AFP, REUTERS)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

We are also coordinating with our international partners, including Nato,\" he said. A readout of the call issued by his Downing Street office also said that Duda had updated Sunak on the Polish investigation efforts, with Sunak offering \"any assistance needed to urgently establish what happened.\" UK foreign minister James Cleverly earlier said that the UK was urgently looking into the reports, adding they were in contact with Poland and Nato allies.\n\nUpdated at 20.05 EST\n\n16 Nov 2022 19.22 EST G7 leaders to have emergency summit after Poland explosion G7 leaders are arranging an emergency summit meeting on Wednesday in response to the explosion in Poland, the Kyodo news agency said, citing a Japanese government source. It will take place in Bali in Indonesia, where the G20 summit is already under way. It means the heads of government from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom will discuss the incident and possible consequences. All of them are members of Nato, apart from Japan.

Duda said it was \"most-likely\" a Russian-made rocket but \"we do not have any conclusive evidence at the moment as to who launched this missile this is all still under investigation at the moment.\" He added it was likely Poland will active Natos article 4 at a meeting of Nato on Wednesday. This is from the Guardians diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. Poland's Duda says has no definitive evidence on who fired rocket. Poland has summoned RU ambassador over the firing of \"a Russian made missile\", but Ukraine has Russian made S-300s surface to air missiles (that would not be fired but for Russia destroying Ukr energy network).

Speaking to reporters, Morawiecki said security forces and international experts were in Przewodw, eastern Poland, where two people have been killed to try to determine the cause of the explosion. He repeated several already-announced measures, including an increased military readiness and talking to Nato allies about an article 4 meeting between member states. Warsaw will also step up monitoring of its airspace. The prime minister went on to ask for people to be restrained. \"I call on all Poles to remain calm around this tragedy. Lets be prudent, lets not let ourselves be manipulated. \"We need to be ready to face fake news, propaganda efforts.\"\n\nUpdated at 18.47 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 18.21 EST Julian Borger This is an analysis from our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, on why the explosion is unlikely to trigger a military escalation between Nato and Russia. He writes: Even if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an \"armed attack\" envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Deliberate armed attack is a real thing,\" Alberque said. \"Two misfired cruise or ballistic missiles aint it.\" Up to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that rather than any form of direct Nato involvement would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness. That is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets.

In a statement on Polands governments website, a spokesperson said: \"The minister of foreign affairs, Zbigniew Rau summoned the ambassador of the Russian federation to the ministry of foreign affairs and demanded immediate detailed explanations.\"\n\n15 Nov 2022 18.04 EST The US president, Joe Biden, has offered Polands leader, Andrzej Duda, the USs \"full support for and assistance with Polands investigation\", Reuters reports. In a telephone call, the Polish president gave Biden an update on the inquiry into the explosion that killed two people, and in turn Biden said the US had an \"ironclad\" commitment to Nato. The full readout provided by the White House said: \"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening. \"President Duda described Polands ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. \"President Biden offered full U.S support for and assistance with Polands investigation.

In an address to the nation, he said: \"As a result of the strikes, several nuclear reactors at two plants were automatically disabled. These consequences were calculated, and the enemy knew exactly what it was doing.\" He said that power has been restored to 8m homes after blackouts caused by the latest bombardment. \"About 10 million Ukrainians were disconnected after the terrorist attack. Supply to eight million consumers has already been restored. Power engineers and repairmen will work all night,\" he tweeted.\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.40 EST UK foreign secretary James Cleverley has said the government is \"urgently\" looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland and is in contact with the government in Poland. \"We are urgently looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, and are in contact with our Polish friends and Nato allies,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.38 EST Summary Heres what we know so far, as investigators look into an explosion in Przewodw, a village near the border between Poland and Ukraine on Tuesday, which killed two people. Stray missiles are feared to have exploded in Poland , killing two agricultural workers in a village near its eastern border.\n\nIt came as Russia launched a 100-missile attack on Ukraine , causing damage to infrastructure that left 7m homes without supplies. It has also had an impact on power supply in neighbouring Moldova.\n\nIt is unclear whether the explosion was directly caused by a missile fired by Russia, or whether it is as a result of a Ukrainian anti-missile defence system shooting down a Russian missile.\n\nThe Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki , held an emergency meeting of a government committee on national security and defence matters.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Piotr Mller said that Warsaw had raised its level of military readiness in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nMller said the government was calling for a meeting to take place between Nato members. It would be possibly under article 4 of Natos treaty, which says they \"will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened\".\n\nRussia has denied any involvement. The defence ministry said in a statement: \"Russian firepower has launched no strikes at the area between Ukrainian-Polish border.\"\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he has \"no information\" about the situation in Poland.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it represents \"a very significant escalation\". His foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called for more air defence assistance, fighter jets and a Nato summit to stop further escalation. We will continue to provide updates throughout the evening.\n\nUpdated at 18.09 EST\n\n15 Nov 2022 17.12 EST Nato ambassadors to have article 4 meeting on Wednesday - reports Nato ambassadors will meet on Wednesday at the request of Poland on the basis of the alliances article 4, two European diplomats have told Reuters. According to article 4 of the alliances founding treaty, members can raise any issue of concern, especially related to the security of a member country. Investigations continue into the circumstances around an explosion in Przewodw, near Polands border with Ukraine that killed two people. One of the diplomats said the alliance would act cautiously and needed time to verify how exactly the incident happened.\n\nUpdated at 17.19 EST",

                "cc_text": "Washington CNN\n\nRussia has pummeled Ukrainian cities with missile and drone strikes for much of the past month, targeting civilians and large swaths of the countrys critical infrastructure.\n\nBy Monday, 40% of Kyiv residents were left without water, and widespread power outages were reported across the country. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of energy terrorism and said that about 4.5 million Ukrainian consumers were temporarily disconnected from the power supply.\n\nThe destruction exemplifies how indiscriminate bombing remains the Kremlins preferred tactic eight months into its war on Ukraine. Moscows vaunted hacking capabilities, meanwhile, continue to play a peripheral, rather than central, role in the Kremlins efforts to dismantle Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\n\"Why burn your cyber capabilities, if youre able to accomplish the same goals through kinetic attacks?\" a senior US official told CNN.\n\nBut experts who spoke to CNN suggest there is likely more to the question of why Russias cyberattacks havent made a more visible impact on the battlefield.\n\nEffectively combining cyber and kinetic operations \"requires a high degree of integrated planning and execution,\" argued a US military official who focuses on cyber defense. \"The Russians cant even pull that sh*t off between their aviation, artillery and ground assault forces.\"\n\nA lack of verifiable information about successful cyberattacks during the war complicates the picture.\n\nA Western official focused on cybersecurity said the Ukrainians are likely not publicly revealing the full extent of the impacts of Russian hacks on their infrastructure and their correlation with Russian missile strikes. That could deprive Russia of insights into the efficacy of their cyber operations, and in turn affect Russias war planning, the official said.\n\nTo be sure, a flurry of suspected Russian cyberattacks have hit various Ukrainian industries, and some of the hacks have correlated with Russias military objectives. But the kind of high-impact hack that takes out power or transportation networks have largely been missing.\n\nNowhere was that more evident than the recent weeks of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraines energy infrastructure. Thats a stark contrast to 2015 and 2016 when, following Russias illegal annexation of Crimea, it was Russian military hackers, not bombs, that plunged more than a quarter million Ukrainians into darkness.\n\n\"All the Ukrainian citizens are now living in these circumstances,\" said Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian government cybersecurity official, referring to the blackouts and water shortages. \"Imagine your ordinary day in the face of constant disruptions of power or water supply, mobile communication or everything combined.\"\n\nBig, showy public response\n\nCyber operations aimed at industrial plants can take many months to plan, and after the explosion in early October of a bridge linking Crimea to Russia, Putin was \"trying to go for a big, showy public response to the attack on the bridge,\" the senior US official said.\n\nBut officials tell CNN that Ukraine also deserves credit for its improved cyber defenses. In April, Kyiv claimed to thwart a hacking attempt on power substations by the same group of Russian military hackers that caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe wars human toll has overshadowed those triumphs.\n\nUkrainian cybersecurity officials have for months had to avoid shelling while also doing their jobs: protecting government networks from Russias spy agencies and criminal hackers.\n\nFour officials from one of Ukraines main cyber and communications agencies the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) were killed October 10 in missile attacks, the agency said in a press release. The four officials did not have cybersecurity responsibilities, but their loss has weighed heavily on cybersecurity officials at the agency during another grim month of war.\n\nBetter prepared after years of attacks\n\nHackers linked with Russian spy and military agencies have for years targeted Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure with an array of hacking tools.\n\nAt least six different Kremlin-linked hacking groups conducted nearly 240 cyber operations against Ukrainian targets in the buildup to and weeks after Russias February invasion, Microsoft said in April. That includes a hack, which the White House blamed on the Kremlin, that disrupted satellite internet communications in Ukraine on the eve of Russias invasion.\n\n\"I dont think Russia would measure the success in cyberspace by a single attack,\" the Western official said, rather \"by their cumulative effect\" of trying to wear the Ukrainians down.\n\nMen cross the destroyed bridge with their bicycles in the frontline town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on October 11, 2022 Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut there are now open questions among some private analysts and US and Ukrainian officials about the extent to which Russian government hackers have already used up, or \"burned,\" some of their more sensitive access to Ukrainian critical infrastructure in previous attacks. Hackers often lose access to their original way into a computer network once they are discovered.\n\nIn 2017, as Russias hybrid war in eastern Ukraine continued, Russias military intelligence agency unleashed destructive malware known as NotPetya that wiped computer systems at companies across Ukraine before spreading around the world, according to the Justice Department and private investigators. The incident cost the global economy billions of dollars by disrupting shipping giant Maersk and other multinational firms.\n\nThat operation involved identifying widely used Ukrainian software, infiltrating it and injecting malicious code to weaponize it, said Matt Olney, director of threat intelligence and interdiction at Talos, Ciscos threat intelligence unit.\n\n\"All of that was just as astonishingly effective as the end product was,\" said Olney, who has had a team in Ukraine responding to cyber incidents for years. \"And that takes time and it takes opportunities that sometimes you cant just conjure.\"\n\n\"Im pretty certain [the Russians] wish that they had what they burned during NotPetya,\" Olney told CNN.\n\nZhora, the Ukrainian official who is a deputy chairman at SSSCIP, called for Western governments to tighten sanctions on Russias access to software tools that could feed its hacking arsenal.\n\n\"We should not discard the probability that [Russian government hacking] groups are working right now on some high-complexity attacks that we will observe later on,\" Zhora told CNN. \"It is highly unlikely that all Russian military hackers and government-controlled groups are on vacation or out of business.\"\n\nTanel Sepp, Estonias ambassador-at-large for cyber affairs, told CNN that its possible the Russians could turn to a \"new wave\" of stepped up cyberattacks as their battlefield struggles continue.\n\n\"Our main goal is to isolate Russia on the international stage\" as much as possible, Sepp said, adding that the former Soviet state has not communicated with Russia on cybersecurity issues in months.",

It was the only regional capital Moscow captured in the nine months since Russia's invasion.\n\nThe retreat, which was ordered amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive, represents a huge blow to president Russian president Vladimir Putin who has so far remained silent on the development.\n\nLosing the Kherson region means Russia no longer has uninterrupted land access to Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nAs Putin's troops retreated from the region, some have even resorted to dressing up in civilian clothing as they try to escape, the MoD said.\n\nUkraine liberated the city of Kherson yesterday after eight months under Russian occupation, with soldiers treated to a hero's welcome by jubilant crowds as they arrived in city centre.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky declared Kherson 'ours' as Ukrainians liberated it from Russian forces.\n\nAn adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister has said there is 'panic' in Russian ranks while Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the retreat from Kherson marked 'another strategic failure' for Moscow and 'humiliation' for Putin's army.\n\nHe said: 'In February, Russia failed to take any of its major objectives except Kherson.\n\n'Now with that also being surrendered, ordinary people of Russia must surely ask themselves: 'What was it all for?'\n\n'The Russian army has suffered a huge loss of life as a result of their illegal invasion and have only achieved international isolationism and humiliation. Ukraine will press on.\n\n'The UK and the international community will continue to support them, and while the withdrawal is welcome, no one is going to underestimate the continuing threat posed by the Russian Federation.'\n\nCCTV shows the moment Putin's army blows up the hydroelectric dam before another explosion erupts along the power lines from the dam\n\nPictures released by Maxar Technologies show damage to sections of the northern part of the dam and sluice gates after the explosion\n\nThe Antonovsky Bridge, which is the main route out of Kherson, appears to have been completely destroyed overnight\n\nThe bridge is another key crossing point over the Dnipro River and acts as an entrance and exit to the key strategic city of Kherson\n\nRussian troops destroyed a key Ukrainian dam before fleeing Kherson dressed as civilians in the latest humiliation for deranged despot Vladimir Putin\n\nAntonovsky Bridge and Nova Kakhovka Dam were the two main crossing points in the Kherson region over the Dnipro River before they were destroyed by retreating Russian troops\n\nAs Zelensky's troops arrived in Kherson's main square hours after the bulk of Moscow's forces fled back across the Dnipro River, flag-waving locals wept, chanted the name of the Ukrainian armed forces and kissed the soldiers.\n\nUkraine's artillery had pounded the city and river crossings overnight and into the early hours in the hopes of destroying any last Russians trying to flee. Rumours swirled that thousands of troops might be trapped in the city, but as they day wore on those hopes seemed to be ill-founded.\n\nFears that Russia could be laying some kind of trap also failed to materialise, perhaps suggesting a disinformation campaign to delay the Ukrainian advance long enough for soldiers to get out.\n\nVideos showed Moscow's troops crossing the Dnipro as the sun rose, before they blew up crossing points to stop anyone following.\n\nIt is unclear whether soldiers destroyed the bridge as revenge for having to leave the city or whether it was a more tactical move since the dam also has a motorway and railway over the Dnipro River into the Kherson region\n\nThe dam, which is a key crossing point over the Dnipro River into the Kherson region, was blown up by retreating Russian troops\n\nFootage of the moment it blew up showed an enormous explosion that destroyed the strategic dam and signalled Russia's ongoing retreat\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia's retreat from Kherson marks 'another strategic failure' for Moscow.In a statement, he said: 'The Russian army has suffered a huge loss of life as a result of their illegal invasion and have only achieved international isolationism and humiliation'\n\nHe added: 'The UK and the international community will continue to support them, and while the withdrawal is welcome, no one is going to underestimate the continuing threat posed by the Russian Federation'\n\nRussia said its troops finished withdrawing from the western bank at 5am local time on November 11, paving the way for Ukraine to reclaim more territory\n\nUkrainian civilians cheer, chant, cry and kiss as they welcome troops to the centre of Kherson, with Kyiv's military intelligence saying the city is now under their full control\n\nBritish intelligence analysts believe Moscow's exit from Kherson, a strategically key city, likely started as early as October 22, when Russian-installed figures urged civilians to leave.\n\nUkraine is retaking large swathes of the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnipro River, with its forces largely in control of city itself.\n\nRussia said its troops finished withdrawing from the western bank at 5am local time on November 11, paving the way for Ukraine to reclaim more territory.\n\nVideos and pictures posted on social media later showed residents celebrating in the streets, with the Ukrainian flag flying over a central Kherson square.\n\nThe country's president Volodymyr Zelensky said 'life is returning'.\n\nYuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We always believed that we will liberate Kherson.\n\n'And we are confident that now Russians are beginning to believe that they will never be able to win this war.\n\n'We see the panic in their ranks. We see the panic in their propaganda machine.\n\n'But of course, this is a very important moment, but it is too early to relax... because this war is far from over.'\n\nHe added: 'At the moment we are quietly optimistic. We are beginning to carry out stabilisation measures in Kherson but of course we understand that there are future battles which we will have to win.'\n\nImages showed a large chunk of the bridge was missing after being destroyed overnight, likely by fleeing Russian troops\n\nRussian forces still control about 70 per cent of the wider Kherson region in the wake of the withdrawal.\n\nIn an intelligence update posted on social media, the MoD said Moscow's troops had 'highly likely' destroyed road and rail bridges over the Dnipro River as part of their retreat.\n\nThe exit was formally announced on November 9, but the defence experts said it is likely it started as early as October 22.\n\n'There is a realistic possibility that Russian military equipment and forces in civilian attire had been evacuating in conjunction with the 80,000 stated evacuated civilians in recent weeks,' the MoD said.\n\nIt added that it Moscow is probably still trying to evacuate forces from other parts of the region across the river to defensible positions on the eastern bank.\n\nThe MoD said: 'Kherson was the only regional capital city captured since February by Russian forces so the withdrawal brings significant reputational damage.\n\n'The withdrawal is a public recognition of the difficulties faced by Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River.\n\n'It is likely that Ukraine has retaken large areas of Kherson oblast on the west bank of the Dnipro River, and that its forces are now largely in control of Kherson city itself.'\n\nThe dammed river supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.\n\nPro-Russian Colonel Cassad Telegram channel said: 'So far, there is not enough damage for a large flood, but in the course of subsequent hostilities, it cannot be ruled out that it will be [finished off].'\n\nMeanwhile, satellite pictures released by Maxar Technologies show damage to sections of the northern part of the dam and sluice gates at the hydroelectric power plant.\n\nThis satellite image released and collected by Maxar Technologies on November 11 shows an overview of damaged Antonovsky bridge in Kherson\n\nA satellite image shows destroyed Darivka bridge in Kherson. Images which have emerged show significant damage to several bridges following the hasty withdrawal of Putin's forces\n\nSeized by Russia at the beginning of the war, the Kakhovka dam provides one of the last remaining routes over the Dnipro river in the region\n\nThe Nova Kakhovka dam's strategic importance The dam, which is 30 metres tall and 3.2 km long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds an 18 km3 reservoir which, the volume of water in which is about equal to the Great Salt Lake in the U.S. state of Utah. Seized by Russia at the beginning of the war, the Kakhovka dam provides one of the last remaining routes over the Dnipro river in the region. It supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Moscow and Kyiv have exchanged allegations regarding damage done, or expected to be done, to the dam. Ukraine has said that Russia has mined the dam while Sergei Surovikin, the commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, previously said Kyiv planned to undertake missile strikes on it. Ukrainian officials said the allegation was a sign that Moscow planned to attack the dam and blame Kyiv. Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War concluded in late October that such a 'false-flag attack' could work to cover Russia's retreat from Kherson and act as a distraction from its latest battlefield humiliation. President Zelensky previously said that by blowing the dam, Moscow would be destroying the water supply to Crimea and thus show that Russia had accepted that it could not hold onto the peninsula. The dam was built in 1956 on the Dnipro river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant Advertisement\n\nRussia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of plotting to breach the dam, with Moscow blaming Ukraine for damage to it caused by shelling earlier this month, despite providing no evidence to back these claims.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Kremlin propaganda printed threats to mine the area and unleash a 'grandiose water apocalypse' to stop Ukraine's own counter-offensive.\n\nThis prompted the head of the Ukrainian presidential office Andriy Yermak to accuse Moscow of resorting to new scare tactics after failing with its 'nuclear blackmail'.\n\nBursting the Soviet-era the dam could cause severe destruction to Kherson city, which Russia declared it had withdrawn from this morning, and put hundreds of thousands of people living downstream at risk of flooding.\n\nFurther images which have emerged show significant damage to several bridges following the hasty withdrawal of Putin's forces from Kherson to the East bank of the Dnipro river.\n\n'Satellite images this morning... reveal significant new damage to several bridges and the Nova Kakhovka dam in the aftermath of the Russian retreat from Kherson across the Dnipro river,' Maxar said in a statement.\n\nPresident Zelensky declared that Kherson is back in Ukrainian hands following Russia's retreat from the city - the only regional capital Putin's forces had taken since the invasion began.\n\nJubilant locals wept as they kissed and embraced the first Ukrainian soldiers to arrive in the centre of the Black Sea port, the first major urban hub that fell to Russia.\n\n'Our people. Ours. Kherson,' Zelensky wrote on Telegram as footage showed Ukrainian troops gathering with residents of the city to celebrate the landmark victory on November 11.\n\nIn an address to the Ukrainian people, the President said: 'Today is a historic day, we are returning the south of our country, returning Kherson.'\n\nHe praised the strength and spirit of the people of Kherson, who he said 'believed in Ukraine' despite the 'threats, repression and abuse of the occupiers'.\n\nThe southern city was liberated after nine months under Russian occupation in what has been a major blow for the Kremlin.\n\nUkrainian soldiers were treated to a hero's welcome by jubilant crowds as they arrived in the city centre throughout the day, with celebrations going on into the night.\n\nAn emotional video appears to show locals hoisting a Ukrainian flag on a monument in the city as they support one another and sing together.\n\nEarlier in the day, young men were filmed victoriously cheering as they raised a flag in the city's Freedom Square.\n\nThe Ukrainian national anthem rang out in the central Kherson square as a small crowd sang along while huddled around a bonfire, a video published by Ukraine's parliament on social media showed.\n\nUkrainian troops also reconnected the local television network to Ukrainian broadcasters after retreating Russian forces blew up the television tower and energy facilities, leaving the city without power.\n\nAbout 30 miles from Kherson, Andriy Zholob, a commander of a medical unit, said they saw 'children running to meet us and greeting us'.\n\nIn nearby Mykolaiv province, which Russian forces have failed to capture despite months of attacks, governor Vitaliy Kim said almost the entire region had been returned to Ukrainian control.\n\nOnly the Kinburn cape in the south remained under Putin's control.\n\nIn Ukraine's capital, the news was met with joy.\n\nWrapped in flags, popping champagne corks and belting out the Ukrainian national anthem, people from Kherson living in Kyiv gathered in the city's Maidan square to celebrate.\n\nOne of them was Artem Lukiv, 41. He said: 'I didn't believe it at first, I thought it was going to take weeks and months, a few hundred metres at a time, and now we see them arrive in Kherson in one day, it's the best surprise.'\n\nWhile it would appear a major Russian setback, the Kremlin insisted that Kherson was still part of Russia and that it did not regret annexing the entire Kherson region at a lavish ceremony in late September.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: 'This is a subject of the Russian Federation. There are no changes in this and there cannot be changes.'\n\nA woman holds up a slogan which reads '11/11/2022 Kherson Ukraine' in Maidan Square, Kyiv, to celebrate the city's liberation\n\nA little girl waves a flag after President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that the city of Kherson is back in Ukrainian hands on Friday\n\nPeople have gathered in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Friday night to celebrate the liberation of Kherson after Russia announced the completion of its withdrawal from the southern port city\n\nCelebrations in the capital Kyiv have seen crowds gathering, waving flags and chanting of support for the Ukrainian military\n\nFlag-waving locals wept, chanted the name of the Ukrainian armed forces, hugged and kissed troops as they arrived in the city's main square hours after the bulk of Moscow's forces fled back across the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine's artillery had pounded river crossings overnight and into the early hours in the hopes of destroying any last Russians trying to flee.\n\nLocal residents cheer and wave a Ukrainian flag on top of a statue at Freedom Square in Kherson following the withdrawal of Russian troops from the regional capital\n\nWhile Russia said it had withdrawn 30,000 troops across the Dnipro River without losing a single soldier, Ukrainians have described a chaotic retreat and pro-Russian war bloggers have described them coming under heavy fire.\n\nUkrainian artillery teams had clear views of Russia's routes of retreat and warned: 'Any attempts to oppose the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be stopped.'\n\nSerhii Khlan, the deputy head of Kherson's regional council, disputed the claim that retreating forces took all their equipment with them, saying he was told 'a lot' of hardware got left behind.\n\nSatellite images show the only road route near Kherson across the river, the already damaged Antonovsky bridge, collapsed, with Russian military bloggers saying it was probably blown up as Russian troops withdrew.\n\nLocal reports suggested that Russian troops had been forced to retreat via a makeshift bridge nearby.\n\nA large number of Russian soldiers drowned in the river as they tried to escape and others had changed into civilian clothing, Khlan said.\n\nCouncil member Khlan earlier advised Kherson residents not to leave their homes while searches for remaining Russian troops took place.\n\nUkraine's defence intelligence agency said Kherson was being restored to Ukrainian control and ordered any remaining Russian troops to surrender to Kyiv's forces entering the city.\n\nRumours swirled that thousands of troops might still be trapped in the city, but as the day wore on those hopes seemed to be ill-founded.\n\nFears that Russia could be laying some kind of trap also failed to materialise, perhaps suggesting a disinformation campaign to delay the Ukrainian advance long enough for soldiers to get out.\n\nThe withdrawal, in the face of an intense Ukrainian counter-offensive, marks Russia's third major retreat of the war.\n\nAs the news settles in of the city's recapture, Ukrainians have been celebrating across the embattled country.\n\nScenes of jubilation in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv tonight.

'The Russian armed forces and public in general can see this is becoming a historic humiliation. Hopefully the retreat from Kherson will force wiser heads in the Kremlin to seek a pragmatic way out of this disaster that they have got themselves into.'\n\nCelebrations in the capital Kyiv tonight have seen crowds gathering in Maidan Square, or 'Independence Square', waving flags and chanting of support for the military.\n\nKherson was the first major city to fall to Russia's troops and the only regional capital they have captured - spending eight months under occupation before being liberated\n\nThe Ukrainian flag was flying over Kherson city centre as locals began gathering to welcome Kyiv's troops after Russia said it had completed its withdrawal in the early hours\n\nA young girl carrying the national banner was pictured in the centre of Kherson, as Russia left the city eight months after capturing it during the early weeks of the war\n\nUkrainian troops were pictured in the outskirts of the city being greeted by jubilant locals, as officials said the entire city is almost under Kyiv's control\n\nUkrainians gather on the streets of Kherson to await Ukrainian troops who are now moving through the city after Russia completed its retreat in the early hours\n\nUkrainian rocket artillery unloads on Russian positions near the city of Kherson as Putin's commanders attempt to get their men out of the city using only pontoons and small boats\n\nRussia is facing potentially 'huge losses' in Kherson, an expert has warned, with up to 20,000 men surrounded while Ukraine shells the city heavily (left and right) and advances along multiple routes\n\nUkraine had warned that Russia could be laying a trap for its forces in Kherson, but pressed ahead rapidly with an attack overnight and is now thought to have all-but surrounded the city\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman fires a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft automatic cannon at a frontline in the Kharkiv region\n\nUkrainian troops have begun advancing into the area around Kherson city evacuated by Russia mid fears Moscow's men may be laying a trap for them, uncovering destroyed vehicles along their way (left and right)\n\nA Russian military vehicle painted with war symbols is seen (left) as Ukrainian troops advance into areas previously held by Moscow's troops, as they appear to withdraw from the region\n\nKyiv's men are shown liberating the village of Snihurivka, around 30 miles north of Kherson, after Russian forces began retreating from their positions back across the Dnipro River\n\nA Ukrainian soldier based in Kherson takes part in a training exercise as Kyiv's men get ready to advance into the region that Russia has said it is evacuating, amid fears the 'retreat' is actually a trap\n\nUkrainian soldiers from the 63 brigade train for trench warfare in the northern Kherson region, as they prepare to advance towards the regional capital in the south after Russia said it was evacuating\n\nA Ukrainian tank advances towards the front line in Kherson after Russian commanders said they would be withdrawing, giving up the only regional capital they have taken since the February invasion\n\nA Ukrainian gunner loads high-calibre rounds into the main gun mounted on top of his tank as he prepared to advance in the Kherson region after Russia said it was retreating\n\nPutin 'has been offered surrender terms by the West' as he loses control of Kherson - and 'his cronies have reacted positively because it allows them to stay in power and avoid criminal charges' Vladimir Putin has been offered surrender terms by the West, a respected Russian policy expert revealed, as Moscow's troops were forced to withdraw from the city of Kherson in yet another humiliating defeat. Professor Valery Solovey, formerly at Moscow's prestigious Institute of International Relations and who claims to have connections in the Kremlin, said the surrender would see Russia give up all territory in Ukraine with the exception of Crimea, which would become a demilitarised zone and its status would not be discussed again until 2029. In return, Putin and his cronies would avoid criminal charges over the war and be allowed to remain in power, Professor Solovey claimed. He said the proposal had been discussed between Kyiv and its Western allies before being presented to Putin's inner circle - who had reacted positively to the idea. Russia has been calling for a return to the negotiating table in recent days while there have been suggestions that Washington is quietly leaning on Kyiv to do the same. General Mark Milley, head of the US general staff, said this week that a winter lull in fighting presents an 'opportunity' for talks. President Zelensky has previously vowed never to negotiate with Russia so long as Putin remains in power. The news emerged as Ukraine liberated Kherson after eight months of Russian occupation, with troops greeted as heroes after the last of Putin's forces fled. Weeping locals sang, danced, hugged, kissed and chanted victory slogans as Kyiv's soldiers arrived to take back the city - with parties going on into the night. Russia claimed it had completed the retreat across the Dnipro River without losing a single soldier, but Ukrainians painted a picture of a chaotic retreat, with soldiers ditching their uniforms or drowning while trying to escape. Solovey said the exact terms of the deal would mean Russia giving up any claim to the rest of the Kherson region, along with Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk - including areas occupied since 2014. Crimea would remain a part of Russia but would be forced to demilitarize, with the Black Sea Fleet relocated. A 60mile-wide demilitarized zone would be created along the borders between Belarus, Russia and Ukraine with no heavy weapons allowed inside the zone. Russia would also have to give up its military presence in the Transnistria region of Moldova, while Ukraine would pledge not to join NATO for at least seven years. Six countries have agreed to provide security guarantees underwriting the deal, Solovey claimed, though he did not name them. Guarantees would likely include a pact to come to Ukraine's defence if it were attacked again, and guarantors would likely include Kyiv's closest allies - the US and UK among them. 'If the president declines these conditions which the Russian establishment is ready to accept then military actions continue,' said Solovey. 'If massive rocket attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, first of all, power stations, resume, this means that the president does not accept these conditions,' he said. 'If there is no bombing, it does not necessarily mean readiness to accept [the offer to surrender]. It means that the contemplation continues, and an attempt is being made to get some extra time to assess the situation.' News of a potential Russian surrender comes as Putin's army faces a dire situation on the battlefields of Ukraine. Having been forced to retreat from Kyiv and Kharkiv, Russia's troops withdrew from Kherson in the south: The only regional capital gained since the start of the war and capital of a region Putin declared to be part of Russia just a few weeks ago. Moscow's troops are struggling to make any progress in Donbas despite heavy fighting in recent weeks, with the frontline having remained largely static since late July. Russia did attempt a major attack near a town called Pavlivka, in Donetsk, last week but it ended in disaster amid reports of more than 300 marines killed. Meanwhile Ukraine continues advancing in northern Luhansk where it is now bearing down on the cities of Svatove and Kreminna - strategic waypoints on the way to Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities that Russia spent huge amount of time, effort and blood capturing over the summer. Losing Kherson means any Russian assault on Odesa is now all-but impossible. It also means that Ukraine can now strike parts of Crimea - the crown jewel of his last invasion, in 2014 - with long-range artillery. Kyiv has already said it plans to take the peninsula back. Advertisement\n\n'Kherson returns under control of Ukraine,' Kyiv's military intelligence directorate said on Friday afternoon, telling any Russian troops left in the city to give themselves up immediately or risk being destroyed.\n\nThe loss of Kherson represents a major defeat for Putin and his armed forces. It was the sole regional capital captured by his army since the invasion began, and sits in a region he declared to be part of Russia just a few weeks ago.\n\nLosing Kherson means any Russian assault on Odesa is now all-but impossible. It also means that Ukraine can now strike parts of Crimea - the crown jewel of Russia's last invasion, in 2014 - with long-range artillery. Kyiv has already said it plans to take the peninsula back.\n\nRussia is now thought to have taken up defensive positions on the eastern bank of the Dnipro comprising three lines made up of trenches and canals, covered by artillery and backed by reinforcements from Crimea.\n\nWestern officials briefing journalists last week said they do not expect Ukraine to begin an offensive across the Dnipro any time soon.\n\nHowever, Western military and diplomatic sources cautioned that the Russian military move did not mean all was said and done - even if it was a major victory for Ukraine.\n\n'It's definitely a turning point, but it doesn't mean that Russia has lost or that Ukraine has won,' said Ben Barry, a senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\n'Russia was still capable of a new offensive or counterattacks. It is far too soon to write them off,' Barry said.\n\nUkrainian forces have liberated 41 settlements as they advanced through the south, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Thursday evening video address.\n\nSappers and pyrotechnicians were going into areas retaken from Russian forces to rid them of thousands of unexploded landmines and ordnance they left behind, he said.\n\nAbout 170,000 square kilometres (66,000 square miles) remained to be de-mined, Zelensky said, including in places where there was still fighting and 'where the enemy will add landmines before its withdrawal, as is the case now with Kherson.'\n\nThe region's Ukrainian-appointed governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said Russian troops had 'taken away public equipment, damaged power lines and wanted to leave a trap behind them'.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said Russia wanted to turn Kherson into a 'city of death', mining everything from apartments to sewers and planning to shell the city from the other side of the river.\n\nA small group of Ukrainian soldiers was shown on Ukraine's state TV being greeted by joyous residents in the centre of the village of Snihurivka, around 55 km (35 miles) north of Kherson city, with a Ukrainian flag fluttering above the square behind them. Reuters verified the location of the video.\n\nA few kilometres away, in a devastated frontline village reached by Reuters in an area already held by Ukrainian forces, the guns had fallen silent for what residents said was the first quiet night since the war began.\n\n'We hope the silence means the Russians are leaving,' said Nadiia Nizarenko, 85. The Russians could be preparing a trap, said Nizarenko's daughter, Svitlana Lischeniuk, 63.\n\nStill, there was joy. Petro Lupan, a volunteer distributing bread to residents, said he could not find words to express his feelings after he learned of the recapture of Snihurivka.\n\nIn the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, 54-year-old Larysa, who had recently fled Kherson to reach Ukrainian-held territory, said she could not reach family in the area.\n\n'We tried contacting them... but there was no connection.

Our village is full of armed Russian soldiers... It is a miracle that we got out... There were tears of happiness when I saw our Ukrainian flag and our soldiers.'\n\nRussian state media and pro-Kremlin war hawks defended the withdrawal from Kherson as a necessary move while acknowledging a heavy blow.\n\nThe retreat would leave Moscow with only limited gains to show for a 'special military operation' that made it a pariah in the West and, according to a U.S. estimate, has killed or wounded some 100,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nFacing losses on the battlefield, Moscow has opened up the possibility of peace negotiations with Kyiv - something the US is said to be quietly pressing for behind the scenes.\n\nAmerican diplomats were said to view the expected slow-down of fighting between the two sides over winter as an opportunity to open up discussions, NBC reported yesterday.\n\nGeneral Mark Milley, chief of the generals staff, backed the idea - saying winter will provide 'a window of opportunity for negotiation' provided both sides can agree that victory is not possible by military means.\n\nA woman is comforted by servicemen as she cries at the scene of night shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine\n\nUkrainian Emergency Service rescuers carry the body of a victim found under rubble at the scene of shelling in Mykolaiv\n\nPolice inspect a dead body at the scene of night shelling in Mykolaiv,\n\nUkrainian Emergency Service rescuers work at the scene of a building damaged by night shelling in Mykolaiv\n\nRescuers work at a site of a residential building heavily damaged by a Russian missile attack in Mykolaiv\n\nHowever, a conflicting report in the New York Times said that European officials were briefing that serious negotiations between the two sides are 'unlikely in the near future.'\n\nPresident Zelensky, speaking last night, said the onus is on the Russian side to prove they are genuine about negotiations and he sees 'no desire' in Putin to end the fighting.\n\n'When Russia truly wants peace, we will definitely feel it and see it,' he said.\n\n'But you can't wish for peace with words alone words are not enough. Stop the war, withdraw from our territory, stop killing people, start reimbursing the damages inflicted on our country. Criminals must be prosecuted. Words are not enough.'\n\nZelensky said after the annexation of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine to Russia that he will never negotiate with Putin, and will instead hold talks with 'the next Russian leader'.\n\nHe reiterated that determination last night, saying that Putin has done nothing but issue ultimatums to Ukraine since the start of the war - and shows no sign of changing his stance.\n\nZelensky added: 'It is only the Kremlin and only one person the head of the Russian Federation who is not tired of the war. [Putin] might be tired of life in principle, because of his age, but he is definitely not tired of the war.'\n\nBanksy goes to Ukraine: Graffiti artist paints new work of gymnast doing a handstand on block of flats shattered by Russian shelling\n\nBY LAURENCE DOLLIMORE FOR MAILONLINE\n\nBanksy is in Ukraine, it has emerged, after the British artist confirmed his latest work on a destroyed building near Kyiv.\n\nIn the piece, a female gymnast can be seen balancing on her hands on rubble at the bottom of a an apartment building, which has been completely gutted by Russian shelling.\n\nSpeculation had been mounting that the anonymous graffiti icon was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in the town of Borodyanka, about an hour's drive north-west of the capital.\n\nOne mural depicted a man resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.\n\nAnother showed two children using a metal tank trap as a seesaw, while a separate piece in nearby Irpin showed a rhythmic gymnast waving a ribbon while wearing a neck brace.\n\nHowever, the mural which Banksy chose to share with his 11.1million Instagram followers is that of the female gymnast balancing on a damaged building.\n\nThe graffiti artist posted three images of the mural on Friday, with the caption simply reading 'Borodyanka, Ukraine.'\n\nIt has since received more than 1.3million 'likes' and more than 14,000 comments.\n\nIn the piece, a female gymnast can be seen balancing on her hands on rubble at the bottom of a an apartment building in Borodyanka, which has been completely gutted by Russian shelling\n\nSpeculation had been mounting that the anonymous graffiti icon was in the war-torn country after a series of murals appeared in the town, which is about an hour's drive north-west of the capital (Pictured: Artwork of gymnast confirmed by Banksy)\n\nRussian soldiers invaded in February of this year, occupying the town for weeks before it was liberated in April (Pictured: Destroyed apartment building featuring Banksy artwork)\n\nBorodyanka was one of the towns hardest hit by Russia's bombardment at the beginning of the invasion.\n\nRussian soldiers invaded in February of this year, occupying the town for weeks before it was liberated in April.\n\nSince then, the town has been the focus of reconstruction efforts, with several tower blocks demolished as a result of damage caused by the fighting.\n\nIt comes as President Volodymyr Zelensky has declared that the city of Kherson is back in Ukrainian hands following Russia's retreat from the key battleground - the only regional capital Putin's forces had taken since the invasion began.\n\nJubilant locals wept as they kissed and embraced the first Ukrainian soldiers to arrive in the centre of the Black Sea port, the first major urban hub that fell to Russia.\n\nOne mural in the town depicts a man resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin being flipped during a judo match with a little boy.

'The situation with fuel is difficult and there has been no electricity for a week,' he said. Temperatures hit 3C (37F) yesterday, with freezing weather expected to arrive next week.\n\nNevertheless, victory parades started to break out after it had become clear that Russia no longer controlled the city.\n\n'Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Heroes,' shouted one man in a video circulating on social media, a slogan first used by the country's military as a greeting during Ukraine's 1917-1921 war of independence.\n\nIryna Osadcha, a 30-year-old Kherson resident, said that she sobbed as she saw Ukrainian soldiers entering the city. 'My emotions cannot be described in words,' she told the Mail. 'I want to thank Britain and the whole world for their help and faith in us.'\n\nDasha Zarivna, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser who was born and raised in Kherson, said she was 'extremely emotional to see Ukrainian flags flying over its city centre again'.\n\n'This war is only going one way,' Miss Zarivna said. 'The Russian armed forces and public in general can see this is becoming a historic humiliation. Hopefully the retreat from Kherson will force wiser heads in the Kremlin to seek a pragmatic way out of this disaster that they have got themselves into.'\n\nIncredible moment wives of mobilised Russian troops who hid under CORPSES to survive massacre find the men near Ukraine frontline and demand their commanders send them home\n\nBY WILL STEWART FOR MAILONLINE\n\nThis is the emotional moment wives of mobilised Russian men - who 'hid under corpses to survive' - travelled close to the frontline to find their retreating husbands and demand commanders return them home from Putin's war hell.\n\nUp to 70 women had set off on foot from Belgorod to occupied Luhansk region in search of their spouses following a 'massacre' blamed on inept senior officers.\n\nSome of the wives reached the men - who have pulled back from the frontline - and confronted commanders who have so far refused to permit them to leave the war zone.\n\nThe women from Kursk region accuse army chiefs of abandoning their husbands after 'only around 30 men survived' from one group of 200 men.\n\n'We won't leave them,' a woman is heard telling an officer in Starobelsk.\n\n'We don't trust you anymore.'\n\nNot all the men made it out of the killing zone, with some hiding in abandoned houses in Golubovka, it was reported.\n\nDesperate Russian wives have confronted army chiefs after from Belgorod to occupied Luhansk region to find their husbands\n\nOne wife, Svetlana Gorbatenko (pictured left and right), who is pregnant, said: 'We have very bad weather.

                "cc_text": "Russia launched its largest bombardment yet of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure on November 15. The wave of attacks on targets across the country was part of Moscows efforts to deprive the Ukrainian civilian population of heating, water, and electricity ahead of the winter season. Russias airstrike campaign to methodically destroy Ukraines civilian infrastructure is raising fears of a humanitarian disaster with tens of millions potentially at risk.\n\nSince early October, Russia has launched hundreds of missiles and kamikaze drones at key infrastructure targets including Ukrainian power plants, large substations which facilitate the flow of electricity to consumers, high-voltage transmission lines, and distribution lines across the country. This bombing campaign is systematic in nature and appears to have been planned with the help of Russian technical experts who have a good understanding of Ukraines electricity infrastructure and weaknesses.\n\nThe clear goal of the attacks is to prevent generators from delivering electricity to the power system and, in particular, to damage and destroy high voltage networks. If successful, this will prevent Ukraine from providing heating and electricity to millions of consumers. As a result of the damage caused by Russian airstrikes, Ukrainian transmission system operator Ukrenergo is already having difficulty balancing the power system and continuously delivering electricity.\n\nBy early November, up to 40% of Ukraines electricity infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed by Russian airstrikes. This lost generation capacity is in addition to the six gigawatt (GW) Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is now in Russian hands, and approximately 5GW of thermal, wind, and solar capacity which has been destroyed or fallen under Russian control.\n\nRussias infrastructure bombing campaign has been so severe that in one single attack no less than eight missiles were fired at a thermal power plant in eastern Ukraine to ensure its destruction. Despite the severity of the bombing, Ukrainian technicians and engineers have been rushing to repair the damaged infrastructure, often risking their lives amid the threat of further airstrikes. Nevertheless, the situation is fast becoming critical.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nUkraines generation capacity is not the main issue. Bottlenecks are primarily being caused by damaged overhead high-voltage lines and transformers which carry electricity from one circuit to another. To deal with the shortfall, Ukrenergo has been carrying out rolling blackouts, with urban areas experiencing regular scheduled cut-offs as the country seeks to save electricity. This is a viable short-term solution, but there will soon be a growing need to keep the lights and heating on as temperatures begin to plummet with the arrival of winter.\n\nUkraine has a number of options as the country looks to address Russias infrastructure bombing campaign. These include saving electricity in large quantities, ramping up the work of thermal plants, importing electricity, and speeding up repair works. Right now, Ukraine has over 14 billion cubic meters of gas in storage, which would normally be enough to support gas-fired electricity and heating generation this winter. However, with a general gas supply crunch in Europe following widespread Russian curtailments, fuel would need to be saved to ensure Ukraine has sufficient volumes next year.\n\nIf Russia does not destroy municipal heating plants in major Ukrainian cities such as Lviv, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, residents in these areas will likely continue to have access to gas-fired heating this winter. At the same time, most of Ukraines thermal power plants run on coal and there is a looming risk of a deficit. Ukraine could theoretically buy coal abroad, but imports would be commercially unattractive because the price of coal is around three times higher than in Ukraine, where prices have been subsidized since 2019.\n\nThe same would apply to electricity imports. Ukraine is currently synchronized with the European grid and could use up to 0.4 GW of interconnection capacity to import electricity from Romania, Slovakia, and Hungary together with Moldova. However, electricity prices in Europe are at least two times higher than in Ukraine, making it commercially difficult for domestic importers to secure volumes from abroad.\n\nWith winter fast approaching, Ukraine must urgently fix the countrys damaged energy infrastructure. The success of these repair efforts will depend heavily on extensive donations of equipment. Since the start of the war, the Energy Community Secretariat, an international institution which has been helping Ukraine to reform its energy sector, has been working actively to attract and coordinate targeted donations.\n\nThe institution set up the Ukraine Support Task Force (USTF) as a one-stop shop, working together with the European Commissions Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) and Ukraines Energy Ministry to receive requests for donations from companies in need while also securing equipment, tools, generators, and fuel from international partners and coordinating shipments to Ukraine.\n\nSo far, 33 shipments with a total weight of 550 metric tons have already been delivered via USTF coordination. Donations have come from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. These donations are collected at set locations in Romania, Slovakia, and Poland before being sent to Ukraine.\n\nWith Russia now openly attempting to bomb Ukraine into submission, there is an urgent need for far more support. The highest priorities are transformers, mobile generators, and heaters. There is also an urgent need for current and voltage transformers, circuit breakers, disconnectors, protection systems, and surge arresters. Even if the equipment specifications do not fit perfectly, Ukrainian engineers are usually still able to find ways to adapt the equipment and use it. Any new, used, or slightly out of order equipment that international companies may still have in stock would be gratefully received.\n\nThe importance of equipment, generators, and fuel donations has already been highlighted by G7 countries. There is now a pressing need for concrete action in support of these statements. Vladimir Putin is attempting to engineer an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in order to rescue his failing invasion. He must not be allowed to succeed.\n\nDr. Aura Sabadus is a senior energy journalist who writes about Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Ukraine for Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS), a London-based global energy and petrochemicals news and market data provider.

REUTERS/Roman Petushkov/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nWASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Ukraine has made a new appeal for the United States to supply it with powerful drones and anti-drone missiles, hoping Washington will reverse its previous rejection as Russia increasingly turns to kamikaze drones and attacks civilian infrastructure.\n\nWith Moscow's invasion in its ninth month, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov in a Nov. 2 letter requested four MQ-1C Gray Eagle unmanned aerial systems or drones, and in a separate document, asked for the first time for a counter-drone missile, according to a document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the request said.\n\nThe drones, which cost about $10 million each, and the counter-drone AGM-114L or LONGBOW would bolster Ukraine's civilian air defenses and help counter Russia's growing use of Iranian-made kamikaze drones far from the front lines.\n\nThe United States rejected Kyiv's prior request for the drones, concerned they could be shot down, were not essential to Ukraine's war effort and could escalate the conflict.\n\nBut Ukraine is hoping that its latest pitch will change minds in Washington since it was coupled with the LONGBOW request and explicitly aimed at protecting civilians and infrastructure.\n\nAs its forces were pushed back by Ukrainian troops in some areas, Russia ramped up attacks last month on civilian infrastructure such as the power grid and water systems, causing outages. Kyiv has said that the attacks destroyed more than a third of its energy infrastructure.\n\nMoscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe United States has extended about $17.9 billion of military aid to Ukraine since Russia launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" on Feb. 24.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Garron Garn, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to comment on specific Ukrainian requests. \"Our support focuses on equipment that is relevant for the current fight,\" Garn said in a statement.\n\nTECHNOLOGY ADVANCE\n\nIn the letter, Reznikov acknowledged the transfer of the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, made by General Atomics, was \"complicated\", but said the large unmanned aerial system would frustrate Russia's ability to strike deep into Ukrainian territory and potentially deny Russia the ability to attack from Belarus.\n\nIf paired with a counter-drone Hellfire missile variant, the Gray Eagles could patrol civilian air space far from front-line areas defended by Russian anti-air systems and possibly avoid antagonizing Moscow, people familiar with the request said.\n\nStrikes behind the front lines pose a big challenge for current air defense systems, Reznikov added in his letter.\n\nKyiv has so far relied on a mix of Soviet-era technology and weapons sent by Western allies, but does not have an integrated system of air defenses to coordinate shootdowns across platforms, leaving civilian infrastructure vulnerable.\n\nIn the early days of the invasion, Ukraine requested the MQ-1C Gray Eagle system to employ Hellfire missiles to shoot down Russian planes and cruise missiles.\n\nBut the Pentagon rejected the plan earlier this autumn, sources said, as U.S. officials worried the Russians might capture the drone and steal the technology.\n\nDefense officials briefed lawmakers privately about that decision last week, making similar arguments and stressing that Russia could view the drones as a provocation, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Gray Eagle, the Army's version of the more widely known Predator drone, has an operational ceiling of 25,000 feet and would represent a great technological leap forward for Ukraine.\n\nIt can fly up to 30 or more hours, gather huge amounts of intelligence data and carry up to eight powerful Hellfire missiles.\n\nReporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "Russia said on Wednesday it would resume its participation in a deal freeing up grain exports from war-torn Ukraine, reversing a move that world leaders had said threatened to exacerbate global hunger.\n\nMoscow announced the sudden reversal after Trkiye and the United Nations helped keep Ukrainian grain flowing for several days without Russian participation in inspections.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry justified the change by saying it had received guarantees from Kyiv not to use the Black Sea grain corridor for military operations against Russia. Kyiv did not immediately comment on that, but has denied in the past using the agreed shipping corridor as cover for attacks.\n\n\"The Russian Federation considers that the guarantees received at the moment appear sufficient, and resumes the implementation of the agreement,\" the Russian ministry statement said.\n\nThe grain deal, originally reached three months ago, had alleviated a global food crisis by lifting a de facto Russian blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain suppliers. The prospect that it could fall apart this week had revived fears of global hunger and pushed up prices.\n\nRussia suspended its involvement in the deal on Saturday, saying it could not guarantee safety for civilian ships crossing the Black Sea after an attack on its fleet. Ukraine and Western countries called that a false pretext for \"blackmail\", using threats to the global food supply.\n\nBut Russia's suspension failed to stop shipments, which resumed on Monday without Russian participation, in a program that was brokered by Trkiye and the United Nations. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu had told his Turkish counterpart the deal would resume.\n\n\"The grain transports will continue as agreed before as of 12 (pm) today,\" Erdogan said in remarks to his AK Party.\n\nThe prices of wheat, soybeans, corn and rapeseed fell sharply on global markets following the announcement, which allayed concerns about the growing unaffordability of food.\n\nInsurance companies had paused issuing new contracts, raising the prospect that shipments could stop within days, industry sources said. But Lloyds of London insurer Ascot told Reuters after Wednesday's resumption announcement that it had resumed writing cover for new shipments.\n\nFuture still in doubt\n\n\"This is clearly a positive development for grain users and consumers which will please the food industry and provide some reassurances as prices should ease,\" said Mark Lynch, partner at Oghma Partners, a finance advisory firm for consumer industries.\n\n\"We do however envisage that some risk premium is likely to be sustained due to the fragile nature of the agreement and the ongoing war in Ukraine,\" Lynch said.\n\nAndrey Sizov, head of Russia-focused Sovecon agriculture consultancy, said Moscow's decision was \"quite an unexpected turnaround\" but the deal remained shaky given uncertainty about whether it will be extended past its Nov. 19 expiry.\n\n\"...The discussion around this topic will apparently continue,\" Sizov said.\n\nA European diplomat briefed on the grain talks told Reuters that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to use the need for an extension as a way to gain leverage and dominate the Nov. 13-16 G20 summit in Indonesia.\n\nPutin said on Wednesday Russia reserved the right to withdraw from the grain accord if Ukraine violated its guarantees. But, in a nod to Trkiye's influence, as well as what he called its \"neutrality\" in Russia's conflict with Ukraine, Putin said that if Moscow did pull out, it would not impede grain supplies from Ukraine to Trkiye.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official who declined to be identified told Reuters that Moscow's decision was mainly the result of Turkish pressure on Russia.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Moscow had miscalculated. \"When you want to play blackmail, it is important not to outplay yourself,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov expressed gratitude for the roles played by Erdogan and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe United Nations said Guterres \"warmly welcomes\" the deal and would continue working towards its renewal.\n\nThe Russian blockade of Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has worsened food shortages and a cost of living crisis in many countries.\n\nIn a Tuesday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy credited Trkiye and the United Nations for making it possible for ships to continue moving out of Ukrainian ports with cargoes.\n\n\"But a reliable and long-term defense is needed for the grain corridor,\" Zelenskiy said. \"At issue here clearly are the lives of tens of millions of people.\"\n\nThe grains deal aimed to help avert famine in poorer countries by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil and fertilizer into world markets.\n\nRussian demands\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said earlier Russia was concerned about its fertilizer and grain exports, echoing Russian officials in saying ships carrying them could not dock even though the exports were not included in Western sanctions.\n\nThere was no mention of any concessions on those issues in the Russian statement on the resumption, but the UN statement said Guterres would work to get those obstacles removed.\n\n\"The Secretary-General continues his engagement with all actors towards the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative, and he also remains committed to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",

Three people were hospitalized with injuries, he said, adding that 354 homes were without electricity and many others were without natural gas.\n\nThe Aquarium Museum in Sevastopol reported the storm tore through the complex, killing all of the estimated 800 animals housed in the facility.\n\nOne death has been reported by officials in Crimea, where a storm warning remained in effect on November 27. Another death was reported on Telegram channels but not confirmed.\n\nIn war-wracked Ukraine, inclement weather adds to people's hardships caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nHeavy snowfall across the country prompted the closure of 14 highways, while 16 of Ukraine's 24 regions were experiencing power cuts. Especially harsh conditions were reported in the southern regions of Odesa and Mykolayiv, where snow drifts as high as 2 meters hampered traffic. Seventy-one accidents, nine with injuries, were reported in Odesa and the Odesa region.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said a total of 2,019 settlements in 16 regions have been left without electricity, while 1,370 trucks remain stranded, and 840 cars had to be towed.\n\nIn the Russian-occupied part of the Kherson region, 94 settlements were without electricity, said Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the region. The wind knocked down nine power lines and damaged more than 50 towers, and communications and Internet have been disrupted.\n\nAuthorities in Romania and neighboring Moldova said hundreds of cities and villages have been left without electricity and water in the two countries following heavy snowfall and blizzards that prompted severe disruption of road and railway traffic.\n\nRailway traffic has resumed in southeastern Romania, but 21 national highways remained closed as of November 27, authorities said, while schools in five southeastern counties -- Braila, Galati, Tulcea, Calarasi, and Constanta -- were also closed.\n\nA total of 22 counties out of 41 and 170 villages and cities in the southeast of the country, including Bucharest, were affected by power cuts.\n\nIn Moldova, 123,000 people from almost 200 localities were left without electricity. One man died when his car veered off the snow-covered road and hit a tree on November 26, police said, adding that several other traffic accidents had been reported.\n\nSixteen Moldovans were injured when their bus was overturned by the blizzard on a highway in southern Romania, police said. Emergency services transported several injured people to the hospital.\n\nIn Bulgaria, snowfall and blizzards prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in several areas in the northeast of the Balkan country -- Silistra and Razgrad regions, Valchi dol municipality, Varna region, and Shumen region. Some 1,000 settlements were without electricity, Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said at an emergency government meeting on November 26.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Russian Service, Digi24.ro, hotnews.ro, unimedia.md, AP, and Reuters",

He said they would take place in late November-early December.\n\nNew START, which took effect in 2011, caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.\n\nRussia in August suspended cooperation with inspections under the treaty, blaming travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies over Moscow's February invasion of Ukraine, but said it was still committed to complying with the provisions of the treaty.\n\n10:34am: Putin not attending G20 due to other commitments, says Kremlin\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G20 meeting in Indonesia because of scheduling commitments, his spokesperson said Friday.\n\n\"This was the head of state's decision, given his schedule and the necessity of him staying in the Russian Federation,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, a day after confirming Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would represent Russia at the November 15-16 summit in Bali.\n\n10:27am: Russia says it takes prisoner swap proposals with US seriously\n\nThe Kremlin said on Friday that it always takes prisoner swap proposals with the United States seriously, when asked whether Russia was ready to intensify negotiations with Washington.\n\n\"There are existing channels, they should be discreet,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he expected Russian President Vladimir Putin to talk more seriously about a potential prisoner swap to secure the release of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony on drugs charges.\n\n10:26am: 'Work underway' to address Russia's concerns on extension of grain deal\n\nThe Kremlin said on Friday that work was underway to address a number of Russian concerns regarding the Black Sea grain initiative, which is due to expire on November 19.\n\nSpeaking as delegates from Russia and the United Nations were due to meet in Geneva to discuss a possible extension to the deal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was a \"reciprocal understanding\" about Russia's calls for the West to remove \"obstacles\" to its own fertiliser and grain exports.\n\n10:23am: Kremlin says Ukraine's Kherson still Russian 'subject' despite withdrawal\n\nThe Kremlin said Friday that the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine was still part of Russia even though Moscow announced its troops were retreating as Ukrainian troops advanced.\n\n\"This is a subject of the Russian Federation. There are no changes in this and there cannot be changes,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, after defence officials in Moscow this week announced the draw-down of its forces in the region.\n\n9:48am: Strategic bridge near Ukraine's Kherson collapses\n\nThe Antonivskiy bridge, the only nearby road crossing from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson to the Russian-controlled eastern bank of the Dnipro River, has collapsed, Ukraine's public broadcaster quoted local residents as saying on Friday.\n\nThe Suspilne broadcaster published a photograph showing whole sections of the bridge missing. The next road crossing across the Dnipro is more than 70 km (43 miles) from Kherson city.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what had caused the bridge's collapse. Russia announced on Wednesday it was retreating from the west bank of the Dnipro River to the other side.\n\n9:33am: Russian strike on residential building kills at least five in southern Ukraine\n\nUkraine said Friday that at least five people were killed following a Russian strike on a residential building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, near the front line.\n\nThe attack came as Russia said it was drawing down troops from the nearby city of Kherson, the only regional capital Moscow's forces captured in Ukraine after they launched their February invasion.\n\nThe Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on social media that the toll had risen to five after the latest fatal attack on the city that has been battered for months by Russian forces.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said the strike was a \"cynical response to our successes at the front.\"\n\n4:42am: Seoul denies report of arms deal with US for Ukrainian forces\n\nSouth Korea on Friday denied a report that it would sell artillery shells for use by Ukrainian forces, claiming the munitions - if the ongoing deal negotiation is finalised - will be for US forces only.\n\nThe United States was nearing an agreement to purchase 100,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery from Seoul which would be delivered to Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing \"US officials familiar with the deal\".\n\nWashington is Seoul's key security ally, and stations some 27,000 US troops in the South to help protect it from the nuclear-armed North.\n\nSouth Korea said Friday that while the arms deal with the US is ongoing, the shells are not meant to be delivered to Ukraine.\n\n3:59am: Japanese national killed fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers\n\nA Japanese man fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers against Russia was killed in combat on Wednesday, becoming the country's first confirmed casualty in the war, authorities in Tokyo said Friday.\n\nA foreign ministry official told AFP the man is believed to be the first Japanese national to have died in Ukraine \"since the invasion began in February\".\n\nJapan has for months urged its citizens to evacuate the war-ravaged nation and has issued its highest-level warning against travelling there.\n\nWhile no other details were provided by officials, Jiji Press reported that the man belonged to a squad fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly invited foreigners to his country to join an \"international legion\" that would fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russians.\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP and Reuters)\n\nFrance Mdias Monde graphic studio\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

                "cc_text": "Nine months is enough time to bring a human being to birth, but it is apparently not long enough for Russian President Vladimir Putin to realize the folly of his war against Ukraine. Instead, it is becoming increasingly clear that no meaningful settlement will be possible as long as Putin remains in power. The international community must therefore seek pathways to a lasting peace with a future post-Putin Russia.\n\nFor many decades, the USSR and subsequently the Russian Federation played a major role in advancing humanitys progress. In sharp contrast to his predecessors, Vladimir Putin is now leading Russia away from that legacy and is transforming the country into a pariah state. Russian acts of hostility are global in scale and include everything from waging war in Georgia to the subversion of domestic politics throughout the West. Since the unprovoked attack on Ukraine began in 2014, the Putin regime has embarked on a further diplomatic frenzy that has increasingly alienated Russias erstwhile closest friends and foreign partners.\n\nYet just four years ago, Russia was party to a UN Security Council resolution on the protection of civilians in armed conflict which recognized for the first time the intrinsic link between hunger and conflict. Russia now behaves in stark defiance of these principles. On four separate occasions this year, the UN General Assembly has resoundingly rebuked Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and unwarranted and egregious violations of UN norms. Russia has been suspended from the UN Human Rights Council and the Council of Europe, and has lost its seat on the Governing Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nIn a March 2022 resolution, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva agreed to establish a commission to investigate violations committed during Russias invasion of Ukraine. A subsequent resolution examined the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the invasion. This led to a report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine addressing events during late February and March 2022 in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy regions of northern Ukraine.\n\nEvidence continues to mount indicating tens of thousands of war crimes committed by Russian forces acting under command responsibility, as distinct from occasional rogue elements. This evidence includes official statements, actions, and systemic politically-driven campaigns with clear genocidal intent, including widespread ethnic cleansing, deportations, and repeated large-scale missile and artillery targeting of civilian populations and vital civilian infrastructure.\n\nFor a comparatively minor territorial gain, Putin has sacrificed Russias reputation and socio-economic well-being. Even worse, the ricochet effects have also surged around the world creating food and energy insecurity, escalating inflation, and widespread impoverishment. There would never have been a good time for such willful misadventure, but coming in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the timing could hardly be worse.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nThe increasing mendacity of the Putin regime is now so severe that members of the elite cannot even trust each other, with key figures close to the Kremlin engaging in public attacks on the leadership of the Russian military. As battlefield failure and international isolation continue to erode Putins authority, his entire model of government is now under threat. Russias prospects today are the dimmest they have been since World War II, with a range of possible dangers now emerging including deepening internal divisions and the potential collapse of the country.\n\nWhile it is important to rule out any interference in the internal governance of the Russian Federation, the West can and should call for full compliance with Russias international obligations to defend the human rights and legitimate aspirations of Russian citizens. At this stage, the inclusion of Russian local governments and municipalities in the global effort to tackle climate change and pandemic recovery could be an opener to the de-concentration or leveling of power. When President Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change, several US states and municipalities strengthened their commitment to it.\n\nWe may already be witnessing the early warning signs of a degradation in the Russian state as sanctions and military defeats take their toll and warlords like Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov openly question Putins leadership of the war. Members of the Russian elite need to take stock of this decline and move beyond todays misguided imperialism with a view to harnessing the energies of Russian society and thoroughly reforming the countrys institutions.\n\nThe real Russia is deeper and richer than todays stolen billions in assets and the forfeited lives from Putins genocidal wars against the countrys neighbors. The real Russia, including its repressed civil society and talented Russian communities around the globe, can strive to optimize broad-based outcomes that uplift the people of Russia and enhance their lives whilst restoring international partnerships and global respect. This will only be possible through the openness, transparency, and accountability of elected leaders divorced from the power of money, media, and mania. Multiple networks of Russians abroad need to coalesce around a reform agenda that looks to a post-Putin Russia and ushers in a new era of benign leadership that puts the well-being of the Russian people before the narrow predatory interests of the countrys current kleptocratic leadership.\n\nThe international community should therefore focus their attention and resources not only on enabling Ukraine to win the war but also to encourage a process of reconciliation and convergence that unites all the various and often conflicting elements of the Russian opposition both internally and in the diaspora. This would not be unprecedented. It was the unifying of the Serbian opposition that led to the overthrow of Milosevic regime.\n\nA recognition of the dilemmas and internal stresses that Russia is facing, as distinct from but in addition to the harm caused to Ukraine and the world at large, warrants attention at the forthcoming G20 summit. The stifling of civil society and dissent has deprived the people of Russia of their rightful freedom of expression. Despite various Russian opinion polls indicating majority support for the invasion of Ukraine, this cannot be credibly authenticated. By its behavior and utterances alone, the Kremlin has disqualified itself from international relations. It is time for world leaders to acknowledge that a change of tack in Moscow is essential.\n\nIn order to advance toward the goal of peace, the international community must act to help empower alternative Russian voices. The global networks, institutions, and methods that can enable capacity for mediation and negotiation in conflicts around the world, are a vital resource to foster engagement with Russian civil society, which is largely silenced internally but not abroad, and can also be approached virtually at the local level. Getting Russian civil society to converge on peaceful alternatives and a different narrative than the Kremlins is the key to de-concentrating political power in Russia and incubating real participatory reform. It may also be the best way to achieve a sustainable peace.\n\nAmbassador Francis M.

Meanwhile, a top US general said Russia's army has lost more than 100,000 personnel. DW has the latest.\n\nThe White House announced a new $400 million (394 million) military aid package for Ukraine on Thursday that will include air defense systems.\n\nJake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said the package includes \"important air defense contributions\" such as missiles for Hawk air defense systems as well as US Avenger air defense systems that come equipped with Stinger missiles.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon statement, the package will also include additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other weapon systems, 100 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), 400 grenade launchers, demolition equipment for obstacle clearing, and cold weather protective gear.\n\nSullivan also said the United States has detected some signs that Russian forces may be planning to withdraw from the Ukraine city of Kherson.\n\nHe said that the Russian withdrawal from some areas in Ukraine does not mean the Ukraine war is concluding. Sullivan added that Washington was not pressuring Ukraine to engage in diplomacy with Russia over the war.\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on Thursday, November 10:\n\nUS revokes Russia's market economy status\n\nThe United States will no longer treat Russia as a market economy country, the US Commerce Department said, revoking the status granted two decades ago that limited the calculation of anti-dumping duties on Russian goods.\n\nThe move comes after Western nations imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February, while authorities in Moscow scrambled to shore up its economy and the ruble.\n\n\"This decision gives the United States the ability to apply the full force of the (anti-dumping) law to address the market distortions caused by increasing interference from the Russian government in their economy,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe determination of a market economy status is based on an evaluation of criteria such as currency convertibility, government control of means of production, and foreign investment climate.\n\n\"Commerce found extensive backtracking in these areas, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine,\" the department said.\n\n41 settlements liberated in southern Ukraine Zelenskyy\n\nUkrainian forces have liberated 41 settlements as they advance through the south of the country, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.\n\n\"Today we have good news from the south,\" he said. \"But although we are joyful, we must remember now and forever what this movement means every step by our defence forces represents ... lives given for the freedom of Ukrainians.\"\n\nZelenskyy also said that Ukrainians have to go all the way \"on the battlefield and in diplomacy\" to return Ukrainian flags all over Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian troops pushed towards Kherson, after Russia ordered one of the war's most significant retreats. A forced pullout from Kherson, the only provincial capital Moscow had captured after invading Ukraine, would mark one of Russia's worst setbacks of the war.\n\nKyiv says Russia plans to 'ruin' Kherson\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reacted skeptically to Moscow's announcement that Russian troops would withdraw from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson.\n\nIn a rare move, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in a televised briefing on Wednesday that troops should leave the west bank of the Dnieper River where Kherson is situated.\n\n\"The Russian troop units are manoeuvring to prepared position on the left bank of the Dnipro river in strict accordance with the approved plan,\" the Russian defence ministry said on Thursday.\n\nThe leader of the Russian constituent republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, said that he considers the Russian troop withdrawal to be the correct decision.\n\nBut Zelenskyy cast doubt on the announcement, saying: \"The enemy does not bring us gifts, does not make 'gestures of goodwill.'\"\n\nZelenskyy added in his nightly address that any gains for Ukraine would only come \"at the expense of \"lives lost by our heroes.\"\n\n\"[Russia] wants to turn Kherson into a 'city of death.' [The Russian] military mines everything they can: apartments, sewers. Artillery on the left bank plans to turn the city into ruins,\" Zelenskyy's adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Thursday.\n\nA British defense intelligence update on Thursday said Russian forces \"had been placed under pressure by Ukrainian strikes on Russia's resupply routes.\"\n\nAccording to the update, the withdrawal would likely take days as Russia's forces destroyed bridges and \"laid mines\" to stall advancing Ukrainian troops.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office said he spoke with Zelenskyy on Thursday and agreed it was right to express caution about Russia's pullout \"until the Ukrainian flag was raised over the city.\"\n\nDW's correspondent in Kyiv, Nick Connolly, said the Russian televised announcement was inconsistent with Moscow's earlier withdrawals from occupied Ukrainian regions.\n\n\"This is definitely a break in strategy. Also, all the talk about wanting to save Russian soldiers' lives ... that is also not something that really gels with what Russia has been doing elsewhere,\" Connolly said, adding that this has led Ukrainians to believe that the announcement is \"a trap.\"\n\nCan we believe Russia's Kherson withdrawal announcement? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSpain to send two more air defence systems to Ukraine\n\nSpain is to send Ukraine two more HAWK surface-to-air missile launchers on top of the four it has already dispatched to counter the Russian invasion, the Spanish government said. \"Two extra launchers will be sent\" following a request from NATO, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said.\n\nMadrid at the start of the month said it was sending anti-missile and air defence systems, including four HAWK missile launchers and an Aspide surface-to-air missile system.\n\n\"We are firmly committed to Ukraine because we understand that it is exercising its legitimate right to self-defence,\" Robles said.\n\nHer ministry said that 64 members of the Ukrainian military would be trained in the central Spanish city of Toledo from next week on deactivating explosives, mine clearance and sharpshooting.\n\nTwenty-one other Ukrainian soldiers are being trained to handle 105/14 howitzers in the southern city of Almeria, it added, and another 19 have learnt how to use the Aspide air defence system. The ministry says Spain is to train around 400 Ukrainian soldiers every two months.\n\nEU won't recognize Russian passports from occupied Ukraine\n\nThe European Union said it will not recognize Russian passports issued in regions of Ukraine annexed by Moscow.\n\nThe move, which also covers two Kremlin-controlled areas of Georgia, means Russian travel documents given to residents of those regions cannot be used to get visas or to enter the Schengen zone.\n\n\"This decision is a response to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine and Russia's practice of issuing Russian international passports to residents of the occupied regions,\" the European Council said in a statement.\n\nThe move still needs to be formally signed off by the European Parliament and EU member states.\n\nIn September, Russian President Vladimir Putin laid claim to four regions of Ukraine in a unilateral declaration widely rejected by the international community. Moscow also annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014.\n\nPutin won't attend G20 summit in Bali\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will not travel to Bali to attend the G20 summit next week, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be there, officials said.\n\nPutin had long left open his participation in the meeting on November 15 and 16. Indonesian President Joko Widodo had invited him to the summit of 20 major industrialized nations despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the international condemnation.\n\n\"The Russian foreign minister will come in person,\" said Jodi Mahardi, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of Investment responsible for coordinating the summit. The Kremlin later confirmed this.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some Western countries had called for Russia to be expelled from the G20. Zelenskyy is likely to attend the Bali summit via video link, presidential spokesman Serhiy Nykyforov has said.\n\nNATO says Russia 'coming under heavy pressure'\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said he was waiting to see how Russia's retreat from Kherson plays out, and that, if confirmed, it would be \"another victory for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"We have to see how the situation on the ground develops in the coming days. But what is clear is that Russia is under heavy pressure,\" he told reporters in Rome following a meeting with new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nHe added that NATO would support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes.\"\n\n\"The unprecedented support that NATO allies, including Italy, has provided is making a difference on the battleground every day and remains vital for the Ukrainian progress,\" he said.\n\nMeloni, for her part, said her government was committed to defending \"the territorial integrity, sovereignty and freedom of Ukraine.\"\n\nRussian pullback shows Ukrainian strategy is working To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nTop US general estimates 100,000 Russian casualties\n\nTop US General Mark Milley said more than 100,000 Russian military personnel have been killed or injured in Ukraine.\n\n\"Same thing probably on the Ukrainian side,\" Milley said in remarks in New York.\n\nHe also said that there was a possibility for negotiations to end the war as military victory might not be possible for both sides.\n\n\"There has to be a mutual recognition that military victory is probably in the true sense of the word maybe not achievable through military means, and therefore you need to turn to other means,\" Milley said.\n\n\"There's ... an opportunity here, a window of opportunity for negotiation.\"\n\nAmnesty labels Russia's 'transfer' of civilians a war crime\n\nHuman rights organization Amnesty International has accused Russia of unlawfully transferring and deporting civilians from occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\nIn a report published Thursday , it alleged the actions amounted to war crimes and likely crimes against humanity.\n\nAccording to the rights group, Russian forces have been forcibly moving civilians from occupied areas into Russian-controlled territory or into Russia itself.\n\nIt also alleged that children had been separated from their families, and that people had been subjected to \"abusive screening processes known as 'filtration' which sometimes resulted in arbitrary detention, torture, and other ill-treatment.\"\n\n\"Separating children from their families and forcing people hundreds of kilometers from their homes are further proof of the severe suffering Russia's invasion has inflicted on Ukraine's civilians,\" said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty's secretary general.\n\nThe rights group said it interviewed 88 people, most of them civilians from the Black Sea port of Mariupol, as well as residents from the Kharkiv, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nMoscow has been evacuating thousands of civilians, in particular from the Kherson area, in recent weeks in what Kyiv has described as a forced deportation.\n\nUkraine signs peace accord with Southeast Asian bloc\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba signed a treaty on cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the latest bid by Kyiv to shore up international support.\n\nThe highly symbolic move comes despite the ASEAN nations being rather reserved in their stance toward Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is set to attend the ASEAN summit in person.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin won't attend the summit in Cambodia, nor will he go to the upcoming G20 meeting in Indonesia. Moscow will instead send Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nAsked to comment on Ukraine's presence at the meetings, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said \"This theme in general has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nfb/wmr (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",

Pete Marovich for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON The United States on Wednesday accused North Korea of covertly shipping a \"significant number\" of artillery shells to Russia to aid its war effort in Ukraine, a sign that Moscow is increasingly turning to pariah states for military supplies as the grinding conflict persists.\n\nThe White Houses national security spokesman, John Kirby, said that it was unclear if the artillery munitions, which are being transferred through the Middle East and North Africa, had reached Russia. The United States does not believe that the additional weapons will alter the trajectory of the war.\n\n\"Our indications are the DPRK is covertly supplying and were going to monitor to see whether shipments are received,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. \"Our information indicates that theyre trying to obscure the method of supply by funneling them through other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\"\n\nNorth Korea said in September it had never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and has no plans to do so.\n\nThe Biden administration said in September that Russia was seeking to purchase artillery shells and rockets from North Korea. The United States is also concerned that Iran may be shipping drones and surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nMr. Kirby said that Russia had now gone beyond shopping for such artillery and had made purchases. He would not elaborate on how the weapons were being transported or whether the United States intends to try to intercept them.\n\nThe United States believes that Ukraine will continue to have the ability to defend itself if the North Korean munitions do reach Russia.\n\n\"We dont we dont believe that this will change the course of the war,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nThe State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the United States would use \"every tool\" to enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, and would \"look at additional tools and authorities that we may be able to call upon to counter this activity.\"\n\nHe also urged nations that have relations with North Korea to pressure its government not to provide weapons to Russia.\n\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting.",

Finbarr OReilly for The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Even as Ukrainian officials celebrate the arrival of more advanced Western air-defense systems and claim growing success at shooting down Russian rockets and drones, they are warning that Moscow is on the hunt for new long-range weapons against which Kyivs forces have little defense specifically, ballistic missiles from Iran.\n\nA spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force said the Kremlin had plans to buy Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar ballistic missiles from Iran, which the Ukrainians say will almost certainly be used to continue to target civilian energy infrastructure that has already been battered by barrages of attacks in recent weeks.\n\n\"We have information that they achieved some agreement on delivery,\" the spokesman, Yurii Ihnat, said at a news conference on Monday.\n\nIran has denied plans to sell ballistic missiles to Russia. But Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraines defense intelligence directorate, has said delivery of Iranian missiles could happen by the end of November.\n\n\"Its a serious threat because Iranian missiles, unlike Russian ones, are quite high-precision, very high-speed, and those features have been battle-proven,\" he said in a recent interview with the War Zone, an online publication focused on military matters.\n\nUkrainian officials have declined to disclose details about the number of missiles Russia may be seeking to acquire. But Mr. Ihnat said Ukraine was in discussions with its Western allies over how to counter the threat.\n\n\"It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is actually very difficult to do this with the capabilities we have at our disposal today,\" he noted.\n\nOne possibility would involve destroying ballistic missiles at their launch, he said. But for that, Ukraine would probably need longer-range weapons of the type that the United States and other allies have so far been reluctant to provide, fearful that Ukraine could use them to hit military targets inside Russia and possibly escalate the conflict.\n\nThe missiles Moscow is seeking to acquire from Iran are similar to the Iskander missiles that Russia has used since the outset of its invasion in February. Western military analysts and Ukrainian officials say Russia is turning to Iran because its stocks of Iskanders have been severely depleted.\n\nRussia has other weapons at its disposal, including Kalibr cruise missiles and Iranian-made attack drones. Ukraine has gotten better at shooting those down, employing portable air-defense systems, attack jets and a mix of Soviet-era air defenses and newly arriving Western systems.\n\nUltramodern German IRIS-T air-defense systems so new that they had never before been used on the battlefield were extremely effective in shooting down missiles fired by Russia during a wave of strikes at the end of October, according to the Ukrainian military. And Ukrainian officials announced on Monday the arrival of the first two of eight advanced surface-to-air missile systems, or NASAMS, promised by the Pentagon. Each is equipped with radar-guided missiles with a range of up to 30 miles.\n\nHowever, these advanced systems are not designed to defend against ballistic missiles and are expensive to use against relatively cheap drones.\n\nUkrainian officials say they believe that Moscow will continue to try to overwhelm its defenses with sheer volume, as it did on Oct. 31, when Russia fired approximately 55 missiles targeting critical infrastructure. Only 10 are reported to have gotten through the defenses, but they inflicted considerable damage on energy structures, forcing Ukraine to ration power in order to prevent a collapse of the electricity grid.\n\nThe Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research body, wrote in a report this week that while the strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure were \"unlikely to change Russias battlefield fortunes,\" they were \"causing major problems and generating new requirements for Ukrainian air-defense equipment.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country was \"gradually moving toward our goal\" of completely defending its skies.\n\n\"As of today, we can say that the recent escalation of Russian missile and drone terror has only resulted in the world responding responding with new aid to Ukraine,\" he said in his overnight address on Monday.\n\nFarnaz Fassihi contributed reporting.",

                "cc_text": "Preamble\n\nWe, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, underline our strong sense of unity and our unshakable commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to protect the rights of all, including the most vulnerable.\n\nAll Members of the United Nations must refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any state in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Violations of universally agreed and legally binding fundamental principles such as peaceful cooperation, sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial integrity are unacceptable. We are clear in our commitment to hold those responsible for egregious violations of such basic principles of international law to account.\n\n1. Russias war against Ukraine\n\nWe again call on Russia to immediately stop its war of aggression against Ukraine and withdraw all of its forces and military equipment. Together with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba we condemn Russias recent escalation, including its attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, across Ukraine using missiles and Iranian drones and trainers. Through these attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. Indiscriminate attacks against civilian population and infrastructure constitute war crimes and we reiterate our determination to ensure full accountability for these and crimes against humanity. We also condemn the violation of Moldovan airspace.\n\nRussias irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable. Any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We also reject Russias false claims that Ukraine is preparing a radiological \"dirty bomb\". The inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that these allegations are baseless, and we commend Ukraine for its transparency.\n\nWe also condemn Russias continued seizure and militarization of Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and the willful destabilization of its operations. We support the IAEAs efforts to establish a Safety and Security Zone.\n\nWe will continue to impose economic costs on Russia and on other countries, individuals or entities providing military support for Moscows war of aggression, as several of us have already done regarding Irans provision of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Russia.\n\nWe reiterate our call for the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling Russias war of aggression, including permitting Russias armed forces to use Belarusian territory to launch missiles targeting Ukraine. If the Belarusian authorities more directly involve Belarus in Russias war, the G7 will impose overwhelming additional costs on the regime.\n\nWe reiterate our unwavering commitment to continue providing the financial, humanitarian, defense, political, technical, and legal support Ukraine needs to alleviate the suffering of its people and to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. We salute the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of Russias unprovoked aggression, and we are committed to helping Ukraine meet its winter preparedness needs.\n\nToday we establish a G7 coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. We look forward to the 13 December international conference in Paris aimed at supporting Ukraines civilian resilience, organized by France and Ukraine. We also welcome the outcomes of the 25 October International Experts Conference in Berlin and remain committed to contribute to the recovery, reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine. We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nWe reaffirm our support for press freedom and access to reliable information globally. We will continue to counter Russias disinformation, including false allegations concerning bioweapons. We are strengthening the G7 Rapid Response Mechanisms capacity for a coordinated response.\n\nRecalling the 11 October G7 Leaders statement, we welcome President Zelenskyys readiness for a just peace based on respect for Ukraines territorial integrity, sovereignty, and its legitimate right to defend itself from aggression. Russias calls for negotiations are not credible when it continues to escalate the war and issue new threats and disinformation.\n\n2. Global consequences of Russias war against Ukraine\n\nRussias war of aggression is a driver of the most severe global food and energy crises in recent history. We condemn Russias attempts to leverage energy and food exports as a tool of geopolitical coercion. The resulting turmoil is hitting vulnerable countries and communities around the world particularly hard, exacerbating an already dire situation caused by the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and existing conflicts. We will continue to coordinate among the G7 and beyond to help mitigate the consequences of Russias war of aggression on global economic stability and international food, nutrition and energy security by both addressing acute needs and making medium to long term investments in resilient systems.\n\nWe strongly support the United Nations Secretary-Generals call for the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI), which has reduced global food prices. We urge Russia to heed the Secretary-Generals call. The G7 is also leading other vital international initiatives, including the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) and the EU-led Solidarity Lanes. We are also accelerating our work to get fertilizers to the most vulnerable. We commit to promote more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems globally and call on the G20 to support these efforts.\n\nWe continue to encourage oil-producing countries to increase production, which will decrease volatility in energy markets. We will finalize implementation of the price cap on seaborne Russian oil in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Global issues\n\nWe reaffirm the need to strengthen and modernize the United Nations, with a view to making it more effective in the face of mounting global challenges, and we express our support for the vision of the UN Secretary-Generals Our Common Agenda.\n\nWe are committed to strengthening arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts for a more secure, more stable and safer world. We are strengthening export controls, including through international export control regimes, on materials, technology and research that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. In this context, we support Indias early entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n\nWe will also continue to enhance our coordination and cooperation, within and beyond the G7, including on economic security challenges, and we will stand up to acts of economic coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm our intention to increase debt transparency and find solutions to debt vulnerabilities, especially by ensuring the swift delivery of results through the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).\n\nUnderscoring a geostrategic and global approach to connectivity, we renew our commitment to implement the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), including by mobilizing up to 600 billion US-Dollars in public and private investments over the next five years.\n\n4. Iran\n\nWe, the G7 members, express our support for the fundamental aspiration of the people of Iran for a future where human security and their universal human rights are respected and protected. We condemn the violent death of the young Iranian woman \"Jina\" Mahsa Amini after her arrest by Irans so called \"morality police.\" We further condemn the brutal and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters and children. We urge Iranian authorities to honor their international obligations under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nWe advocate the right of all Iranians to access information, and we deplore the Iranian governments erosion of civil space, and independent journalism, its targeting of human rights defenders, including by shutting down the internet and social media. We urge the Iranian authorities to treat women as equal, respecting the universal rights provided to them under the relevant international human rights treaties. We also call on the Iranian authorities to release unjustly detained prisoners, including recently arrested protesters, children, journalists and human rights defenders, and ensure accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations and abuses. We will continue to use all available diplomatic measures to hold the Iranian authorities to account. We call on Iran to allow access to the country for relevant UN Human Rights Special Procedures mandate holders.\n\nWe strongly reject Irans practice of unfairly detaining dual and foreign citizens and call upon Iran to end the repellent practice of such unjust detentions in hopes of political gain.\n\nWe strongly support international efforts to hold Iran to account for its downing of PS752, which killed 176 innocent civilians. We demand that Iran fulfill its international legal obligations without delay.\n\nWe strongly condemn Irans continued destabilizing activities in and around the Middle East. These include Irans activities with both ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, and transfers of such advanced weaponry to state and non-state actors. Such proliferation is destabilizing for the region and escalates already high tensions. We urge Iran to cease its support to violent state and non-state actors and proxy groups and fully abide by all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), including UNSCR 2231. We also support efforts at the United Nations to hold Russia and Iran accountable for their blatant violations of UNSCR 2231.\n\nWe reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. The G7 will continue working together, and with other international partners, to address Irans nuclear escalation and insufficient cooperation with the IAEA regarding its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) safeguards agreement. We remain deeply concerned by the unabated expansion of Irans nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification. We call on Iran to change course and fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments in the field of nuclear non-proliferation without further delay. We note that despite many months of intense negotiations on a return to the JCPoA, Iran has not made the necessary decisions.\n\n5. Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK)\n\nWe, the G7 members, strongly condemn the unprecedented series of unlawful ballistic missile launches conducted by the DPRK in 2022, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the intermediate-range ballistic missile launch on 4 October 2022, which was recklessly launched over Japan. These launches demonstrate the DPRKs continued efforts to expand its ballistic missile capabilities and are flagrant violations of multiple UNSCRs.\n\nWe reiterate our demand that the DPRK abandon its nuclear weapons, existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, in accordance with all relevant UNSCRs. We urge the DPRK to immediately halt its destabilizing activity, fully abide with all legal obligations under the relevant UNSCRs, and fully comply with the NPT and IAEA safeguards.\n\nAny nuclear test or other reckless action must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. We call on all states to fully and effectively implement all UNSCRs and vigilantly monitor, prevent, and penalize sanctions evading activities. We call on the DPRK to cease further escalation and engage in meaningful diplomacy concerning its unlawful nuclear and ballistic programs. We remain committed to working with all relevant partners toward the goal of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and upholding the rules-based international order.\n\nWe commend the work of the UNSC 1718 Committee, which has swiftly approved all COVID-19 related sanctions exemption requests for humanitarian assistance for the DPRK. We call on the DPRK to allow the re-establishment of UN and diplomatic access, in line with appropriate and reasonable COVID-19 regulations. We continue to condemn the DPRKs systematic widespread and gross human rights violations and abuses and urge the DPRK to cooperate with all relevant UN bodies and to resolve the abductions issue immediately. We remain gravely concerned regarding the humanitarian situation in the DPRK, which is the result of the DPRKs choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of its own people.\n\n6. Indo-Pacific\n\nWe, the G7 members, reiterate the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and based on the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, transparency, territorial integrity, and the peaceful and inclusive resolution of disputes. We are committed to protecting and promoting the rules-based international order, improving regional connectivity, strengthening free and fair trade, enhancing national resilience, supporting inclusive economic growth, promoting global health security, as well as confronting the climate crisis and the loss of biodiversity. We reaffirm our intention to work together with countries in the region and our support for the unity and centrality of ASEAN and commit to explore concrete cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP).\n\n7. East and South China Seas\n\nWe remain seriously concerned about the situation in and around the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any moves that increase tensions and undermine regional stability and the rules-based international order. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and reaffirm UNCLOS important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, legally binding upon the parties, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes. We reaffirm the need to uphold the principle of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\n8. China\n\nWe, the G7 members, aim for constructive cooperation with China, where possible and in our interest, in particular on global challenges like peace and security, global health, the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources. These challenges can only be tackled successfully through cooperation within the rules-based international order.\n\nWe remind China of the need to uphold the principles of the UN Charter on peaceful settlement of disputes and to abstain from threats, coercion, intimidation, or the use of force. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.\n\nWe reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the basic positions of G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies.\n\nWe will continue to raise our concerns with China on its reported human rights violations and abuses, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. We reiterate our concerns over the continued erosion of Hong Kongs rights, freedoms and autonomy, and call on China to act in accordance with its international commitments and legal obligations.\n\nWe also call on China to treat foreign diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n\n9. Central Asia\n\nWe, the G7 members, discussed the multiple challenges facing the five Central Asian countries, ranging from the economic and geopolitical consequences of Russias war of aggression against Ukraine, to regional security issues and disputes, to climate change. We are committed to strengthening our cooperation with Central Asian countries and working with their governments and people on socio-economic development, respect for human rights, implementation of domestic and institutional reforms, as well as regional security. We will also work together to foster connectivity, transportation, and trade links.\n\n10. Africa\n\nWe, the G7 members, underscore the geopolitical and strategic importance of the African continent. Close cooperation with our African partners remains vital. Africa is particularly affected by multiple global crises such as the climate crisis, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition, energy insecurity, the socio-economic consequences of Russias war against Ukraine, democratic backsliding, and massive global economic headwinds. Our cooperation with and support for Africa are guided by the objectives of the AU Agenda 2063, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the goals of the Paris Agreement, and the principles of the UN Charter. We will continue to work with our African partners to build resilient and sustainable agri-food and energy systems, mitigate climate change, and address disinformation.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in quality infrastructure in Africa based on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, including through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We will continue to support regional manufacturing capacity for vaccines and other essential medical products supported by sustainable markets.\n\nWe are deeply concerned by the continuing deterioration of the political, security and humanitarian situation, including humanitarian access, in the Sahel. We are appalled by the violations and abuses of human rights against civilian populations, including those committed by terrorist groups and the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces in Mali. We call for accountability of all those responsible for human rights violations or abuses. We express our concern over the growing presence of Russian affiliated forces in Mali and elsewhere on the continent and their potentially destabilizing impact. We call for timely preparation of free and fair elections and comprehensive implementation of the transition charters in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, and reaffirm our support to the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union in this regard. We condemn the violence against protestors in Chad and the failure of that transitional government to adhere to African Union principles and communiques. We reiterate our strong commitment to support the populations of the Sahel countries, especially youth, and emphasize the need to work with people and governments of the littoral states in the Gulf of Guinea to strengthen their resilience to the threat of terrorism in a comprehensive way.\n\nWe remain concerned about peace and security in the Horn of Africa and the acute humanitarian needs, including famine in Somalia, and which disproportionally impact women and girls. We will work with the countries, institutions and civil society in the region to address these challenges. We welcome the announcement of the agreement reached by the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) brokered by the African Union, South Africa and Kenya, to settle the conflict in northern Ethiopia. We urge the Government of Ethiopia and the TPLF to fully honor and implement this commitment. Human rights violations, atrocities and abuses must cease immediately. Perpetrators of these violations and abuses must be held to account; survivors and victims must obtain justice.\n\nWe commend Somalia on the election of a new government and call for a concerted international effort to support President Hassan Sheikh Mohamuds reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We firmly condemn the heinous attack by al-Shabaab on civilians on 29 October and express our heart-felt condolences to the families of the victims. More than one year after the military takeover in Sudan, we continue to urge the military to respect the commitment they made to withdraw from politics and maintain our call for a return to a civilian-led government based on broad support from the Sudanese people.\n\nWe are increasingly concerned by the ongoing, escalating violence and conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as well as regional tensions in the Great Lakes. We urge restraint by the M23 armed movement and call for a cessation of its current offensive. We welcome recent steps taken towards more stability in the region, including through talks with armed groups in the framework of the \"EAC DRC Peace Process\" and regional mediation by Angola. We call on all involved to participate in these efforts in good faith and to act in accordance with international law. We are convinced that only broad, multi-sectoral and cross-border cooperation can bring about lasting stability in the region.\n\n11. Haiti\n\nWe express our deep concern at the worsening humanitarian situation in Haiti, particularly the increased spread of cholera and the deepening food and fuel crisis. We condemn the violence perpetrated by armed groups and those who support them. They are terrorizing and holding the population hostage. We reiterate our commitment to support all efforts to quickly resolve the current security and humanitarian crisis. We call on all stakeholders in Haiti to restore order and security and to allow the delivery of the aid required to meet the urgent needs of the population. We commend the UNSC for adopting a sanctions regime on 21 October. We reiterate the importance of establishing the conditions necessary to allow for free and fair elections.",

                "cc_text": "Image Damage at a residential building in Arkhanhelske, a town in the northern part of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, on Sunday. Credit... Hannibal Hanschke/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\nKYIV, Ukraine Russian forces are stepping up their efforts to make life unbearable for civilians across the occupied southern Kherson region, where power was cut on Sunday night and Ukrainian officials warned that Russian troops were mining critical infrastructure even as they dig in to fight for their last bridgehead west of the Dnipro River.\n\nThe battle for Kherson City the only regional capital to be captured by Moscow since the invasion in late February has been looming for months. A Ukrainian counteroffensive launched at the end of August has reclaimed over 100 towns and villages and steadily closed in on Kherson while also pounding Russian supply routes, command centers and ammunition depots far from the front.\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced, the Kremlin-appointed authorities for Kherson ordered the \"evacuation\" of all civilians last month a move that Ukrainian officials said was less about saving lives and more about clearing space for newly mobilized Russian troops to occupy. Since then, Russian forces have been destroying critical infrastructure, shuttering essential services and looting the city, according to residents and Ukrainian officials.\n\nUkraines military said in an evening update on Monday that Russian forces were \"taking measures to artificially create unacceptable living conditions for local residents, disconnecting electricity and communication.\"\n\nPetro, a 30-year-old who lives in the area, managed to get a message out late Sunday night, saying, \"They are making a desert out of the right bank of Kherson.\" Because of concerns about his safety, he communicated on the condition that his family name not be used.\n\n\"Today they blew up the power poles, so we have no light and no water,\" Petro added.\n\nWhile state media in Russia said that Ukrainian shelling had damaged the power lines, Yaroslav Yanushevych, the exiled Ukrainian head of the Kherson regional military administration, blamed Russian troops.\n\n\"It is impossible to quickly repair the power lines due to a lack of specialists and equipment,\" he said Sunday night. \"In addition, Russian invaders will not allow this to be done.\"\n\nThe Russian forces have also placed mines around water towers in Beryslav, Mr. Yanushevych said, referring to a town less than 50 miles from Kherson City and just north of a critical dam.\n\nRussian forces seized the road over that dam, next to the town of Nova Kakhovka, in the first days of the war, and it is the main artery across the Dnipro River still under the control of Russian forces. If Ukraine regains control of the area, they could prevent thousands of Russian soldiers from escaping.\n\nUkrainian forces are still meeting fierce resistance as they continue battling Russian troops arrayed some 30 miles to the north of the dam.\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials have accused each other of planning to blow up the dam. But military analysts have said that doing so would be logistically challenging and would not serve either armys interests because it would cause flooding and destruction on both sides of the Dnipro.\n\nStill, Ukraines nuclear regulator on Monday ordered an urgent review of the safety risks upriver at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant if the dam were to be damaged.\n\nThe Ukrainian military high command said on Monday that the destruction of critical infrastructure was part of a coordinated campaign to undermine its forces and warned that Moscow had dispatched propagandists \"to shoot videos in the city on the topic of the alleged destruction of the civilian population.\"\n\nTop government officials in Kyiv have also said that Moscow might be trying to create the illusion of leaving Kherson to lure Ukrainian forces into brutal urban combat. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said that it still had seen no evidence that Russian forces were preparing to abandon Kherson.\n\nBut the Ukrainian authorities warned that Russian forces were stepping up the hunt for people helping to direct military strikes. The Russians have \"intensified raids and filtration measures among the local population,\" the National Resistance Center, a government agency supporting resistance efforts in occupied areas, said on Monday.\n\nSo-called filtration centers were set up by Russia to temporarily detain and screen Ukrainians and identify anyone perceived to pose a threat to Russias occupation efforts. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that Russian authorities had \"forcibly deported\" between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens to Russian territory,\n\nThe National Resistance Center said that it was aware of \"dozens of detainees\" who were being taken to camps, saying that once there, they would be interrogated and tortured. The claim could not be independently verified.",

Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight The plan to fortify Ukraine ahead of the punishing winter months was cemented on the second day of Group of Seven meetings here in this historic German city. The symbolic importance of the meeting place the same venue in which the Treaty of Westphalia was signed ending the Thirty Years War was underscored by some of the attending diplomats, who said Russias invasion challenged the world order those centuries-old accords helped establish.\n\n\"If we let that be challenged with impunity, then the foundations of the international order will start to erode and eventually crumble, and none of us can afford to let that happen,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks alongside German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.\n\nThe G-7 statement signed by each nation announced the establishment of a \"coordination mechanism\" to help Ukraine \"repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure.\" It did not set a timeline for implementation, but diplomats attending the event said it was important to act immediately given the onset of winter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin \"seems to have decided if he cant seize Ukraine by force, he will try to freeze it into submission,\" Blinken told reporters at a news conference.\n\nThe meetings of ministers from the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Canada and Italy also included discussions on providing Ukraine sophisticated air defense systems to fend off volleys of Russian missile and drone strikes, officials said.\n\nThe decision to fortify Ukraines infrastructure followed a remote video briefing from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday that was disrupted by a blackout due to chronic energy shortages.\n\nOnce the connection was reestablished, Kuleba finished updating the countries on the extensive damage done to Ukraines infrastructure by Iranian-provided drones and appealed for more global support and pressure on Russia. Forty percent of Ukraines power system has been damaged by Russian attacks that have left 4.5 million people throughout the country without power, including 450,000 residents in Kyiv.\n\n\"They discussed what needs Ukraine was facing as it heads into the winter,\" said a senior State Department official who, like some others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations surrounding the war. \"Thats something that will be a core focus of this group in the days and weeks ahead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA French official said the West is focused on how it can help the inhabitants of Ukrainian towns survive the winter, by providing generators, fuel and spare parts to areas struggling to meet their energy and heating needs.\n\nThe discussion came at what could be another inflection point for the war. While some U.S. officials question Ukraines ability to completely oust Russia from occupied areas, Ukrainian forces continue to make battlefield gains, including around the southern city of Kherson, which Russia has occupied for months.\n\nThe next few weeks there are expected to be dynamic, a U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal assessments, said this week. Russian military leaders have withdrawn to the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, outside Kherson, leaving rank-and-file troops to face Ukrainian assaults. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Thursday that Ukraine \"certainly\" has the capability to take back all territory west of the river.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon disclosed that it will pay to refurbish 45 Czech T-72 tanks and send them to Ukraine, part of a new $400 million military aid package that also includes drones, air defense missiles, riverine boats and money to refurbish M1117 armored vehicles. The Netherlands will also pay to refurbish and send an additional 45 Czech tanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWork is ongoing to send Ukraine other weapons, both from the United States and allies in Europe. Ukraine is expected to need a significant amount of artillery going forward as it launches between 4,000 and 7,000 rounds per day, the U.S. defense official said, putting the Russian figure at about 20,000.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nIn Germany, the group of democracies strongly warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine and rejected Moscows claims that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a \"dirty bomb.\"\n\n\"Russias irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable,\" the statement said. \"Any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences.\"\n\nRussias claims about a dirty bomb first emerged late last month, triggering phone calls among U.S. officials, allies and Russian leaders. Concerns about the issue have \"tamped down a bit\" since then, the U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe unease over Russias nuclear rhetoric was evident Friday in Beijing, where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Chinas president, Xi Jinping, to use his \"influence\" over Putin to help resolve the war. Xi said nations should \"oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,\" but he called the international situation \"complex\" and urged all nations to \"exercise rationality and restraint.\"\n\nReacting to Xis remarks, Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said she was \"pleased to hear\" an important ally of Russia send a \"very important signal\" against the potential use of nuclear weapons. \"Russia,\" she said, \"is totally isolated.\"\n\nStill, Scholzs trip to China has divided Western countries, some of whom have complained that Germany is repeating the mistakes it made ahead of the war in Ukraine by becoming overly dependent on the business of an authoritarian regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile U.S. and British officials have raised concerns about the visit, the first by a G-7 leader since Xi cemented his power at the ruling-party congress, other Western officials have warned against taking an explicitly antagonistic approach to Beijing.\n\n\"It is clear that China is becoming much more assertive, much more on a self-reliant course,\" Josep Borrell, the European Unions foreign policy chief, told reporters at the G-7. \"But for the time being, many member states have a strong economic relationship with China, and I dont think we can put China and Russia on the same level.\"\n\nIn the negotiated G-7 statement, the countries said they aim for \"constructive cooperation with China\" but also warned Beijing against trying to resolve disputes through \"threats, coercion, intimidation, or the use of force.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe meeting comes as G-7 nations finalize the details of a price cap on Russian oil. The unprecedented plan could deprive Russia of oil revenue critical to funding the Kremlins war machine. But the complex arrangement also runs the risk of increasing gas prices.\n\nWhen asked whether he could assure that the move would not increase gas prices, Blinken said that \"well see how this plays out\" but that he believed the plan under negotiation would keep enough energy on the market while reducing revenue to the Kremlin.\n\nOn Friday, G-7 countries held meetings on challenges that Central Asian countries are facing as a result of the war in Ukraine. They are also focusing on collaboration with African countries on climate change, the coronavirus, and food and energy security, the U.S. official said.\n\nLamothe reported from Washington.

                "cc_text": "In the days before Russias bombing escalation in Ukraine in early October, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was visiting Africa in a bid to garner support and counter Moscows propaganda about the war. While much of the Western world has rallied around Ukraine, African states have largely avoided taking sides. For its part, Russia has been on a diplomatic offensive in much of the Global South, lobbying African, Asian, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries to not join international sanctions and condemnation against Moscow. Indeed, Ukraines fight against Russia is not only taking place on the battlefield, but also through ambitious and needed international diplomacy efforts that extend from Europe to the Global South.\n\nKulebas early October trip to Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire was the Ukrainian governments first diplomatic tour of Africa in decades according to the foreign minister. The Ukrainian government selected these countries because of their strategic importance on the African continent, their votes in the U.N. General Assembly condemning Russias invasion, and, particularly in the case of Kenya, the strong and public critique of Russias actions within the context of European imperialism. In the case of Senegal, President Macky Sall is chairperson of the important multilateral organization, the African Union.\n\nThe trip was cut short by Russian missile strikes on civilian targets in Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine. But Kuleba laid the groundwork for future efforts to counter Russian propaganda and positive to neutral perceptions of Russia across the African continent, build greater international support for Ukraines fight against Russian aggression, and advance partnerships with African governments focused on areas of mutual interests.\n\nAn aspect of Kulebas tour that makes Ukraines potential partnerships with African countries so important is to increase international pressure on Russia to maintain the export of Ukrainian grain to stave off food shortages in countries where it is most needed. The grain deal brokered by the U.N. and Turkey has faced recent challenges with Russia suspending its participation last week only to reverse course a few days later on November 2 after international pressure.\n\nChallenging Russian Propaganda\n\nAs it has through much of the world, Russia has sought to advance its interests in Africa for years through concerted disinformation and election interference campaigns. From front organizations intervening in elections to growing Russian-state funded media engagement in French to target many African countries, Russias activities on the continent extend beyond arms sales and military cooperation.\n\nA goal of Kulebas trip was tackling and confronting Russian disinformation in Africa. Part of Russias multi-layered disinformation campaign about its war against Ukraine focuses on blaming NATO and the West for the conflict, suggesting that Moscow is confronting a threat to its security, not engaged in a war of aggression. In his meeting with Senegalese Foreign Minister Aissata Tall Sall, Kuleba did not hesitate to confront Russias false justifications for the war. \"The Senegalese may be surprised if they listen to Russian propaganda,\" Kuleba said. \"Russia wanted to make believe that [the war is because] Ukraine wants to be a member of NATO. Finland wants to be a member. And yet Russia did not attack it.\"\n\nRussian propaganda has also tried to erase the distinction between Ukraine and Russia as independent countries with their own histories, culture and language. Kuleba challenged this narrative, asserting that \"Russia also believes that we are one people. This is not true The language we speak is not the same. We have a different culture and a different people.\" If Ukraine hopes to dent the effectiveness of Russian propaganda across Africa, it must continue this messaging campaign.\n\nBuilding Partnerships\n\nKulebas visit has potential to help the Ukrainian government chart a strategic path for developing relationships with African countries. However, \"Ukraine has never been a player in Africa [it] does face a steep uphill climb to garner support for a war so removed from African realities or African geopolitical interests,\" said Kamissa Camara, a Sahel expert at USIP and former Malian foreign minister. \"While Africans are being urged to take sides in the Ukraine-Russia war, protracted wars on the African continent such as the war in Tigray or the war in Eastern Congo continue to make victims by the million,\" she added.\n\nAs the votes in the United Nations General Assembly on Russias war against Ukraine have demonstrated, it is important to mobilize international support beyond the West for the Ukrainian governments fight. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, there has been a series of votes in the U.N. focused on condemning Russian aggression and acknowledging the illegality of its war. Despite 140 nations voting to condemn Russias attack on Ukraine, over 20 African countries abstained or did not vote during the emergency session of the U.N. General Assembly at the end of March. Similarly, many African countries did not vote, abstained from voting, or voted against suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\nWhile the votes were largely symbolic, they still carried weight for understanding how countries in the Global South view Russias war against Ukraine.\n\n\"While most African states are opposed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they have been very reluctant to openly condemn Russia for its aggression or to take sides in a conflict that puts them in the middle of a new Cold War between the United States, its Western allies and Russia,\" noted Ambassador Johnnie Carson, a senior advisor at USIP who also served as the top U.S. envoy to Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nKulebas Africa trip was necessary to begin a more sustained effort by the Ukrainian government to engage with Global South countries, particularly those in Africa.\n\nNext Steps for Ukraine and African Countries\n\nAlong with attempting to strengthen bilateral relationships, the Ukrainian government should work to engage African countries through relevant multilateral forums such as the African Union. That will help to maximize Ukrainian engagement with Africa and further demonstrate its long-term commitment to building relationships.\n\n\"No one or two African countries, or collection of African countries have enough influence to pressure or persuade Russian to stop its aggression in Ukraine, but African countries can play a bigger role by joining the international consensus in openly and officially condemning Russia's actions and in supporting U.N. and Western sanctions against Moscow's behavior,\" noted Carson, who also served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for the bureau of African affairs.\n\nUkrainian engagement with African countries can help to push Russia to maintain its involvement in the grain deal that is so critical for many Global South countries. Many African and Middle Eastern countries rely heavily on Ukrainian grain imports. So, it was important for Kuleba to emphasize and reiterate Ukraines efforts to address the food insecurity many countries are experiencing because of Russias attack on Ukraine and that Ukraine understands what Africans are going through. \"Each Russian rocket is not only hitting Ukrainians, it also harms the quality of life for Africans,\" he said.\n\nUkraine is planning an ambitious agenda for its potential partnerships with African countries. During Kulebas tour, he discussed organizing a Ukraine-Africa summit to deepen relations. Already there is no shortage of topics for such a gathering which could touch on food security, trade, and building a more inclusive international system that protects smaller countries from acts of aggression and reinforces protection of territorial integrity.",

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nAfter months of denials, Iran's government admitted to shipping lethal drones to Russia but claimed it happened before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in late February. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian over the weekend publicly confirmed the drone shipments, but U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley refuted his claims about their timing. Malley wrote on Twitter that, \"Iran didn't give a limited number of drones before the war. They transferred dozens just this summer & have military personnel in occupied Ukraine helping Russia use them against Ukrainian civilians.\" Amirabdollahian said that \"if it is proven to us that Russia has used Iranian drones in the Ukraine war, we won't be indifferent to it.\" Iran's drones have been used to brutal effect on Ukraine's civilian centers and critical energy infrastructure, as Russia's bombardment appears intent on making parts of the country unlivable as winter sets in. They've also come in handy for Moscow as Russia's military runs low on more advanced weaponry like guided missiles.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi greets Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 19, 2022. Putin likely wanted to show that Moscow is still important in the Middle East by visiting Iran, said John Drennan of the U.S. Institute of Peace. Sergei Savostyanov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nBut with Iran's economy in tatters, due in large part to international sanctions, why would it supply Moscow with lethal weaponry in a war that's already so globally condemned?\n\nIran 'doesn't have a lot of friends'\n\nThe answer is manifold, but centers on Iran pursuing strengthened relations with a key strategic ally, Russia; helping Moscow in its effort to combat Western hegemony; and enhancing its own role as a major weapons exporter. \"Iran's immediate goal is to bolster a key ally's military effort in Ukraine when it's clear the Russian war effort is faltering and it's having trouble resupplying its more advanced cruise missiles and drones,\" Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Rane, told CNBC. \"But,\" he added, \"I think this speaks to a wider Iranian ambition to try to ensure that the war doesn't go so badly for the Russian government that their ally is destabilized.\"\n\nThey're very close, and with Russia's new isolation, more dependent on each other than ever. Hussein Ibish Senior resident scholar, the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington\n\nIran \"doesn't have a lot of friends let alone great powers that will offer it any kind of security guarantee,\" Bohl said. \"Russia's security support to Iran is far from perfect, but it is certainly better than nothing.\" And as Iran expands its weapons production and exports, Russia's war in Ukraine also serves as a place where Iranian weapons can be used at scale to further test and refine them, he said. Russia and Iran share a desire to disrupt Western hegemony, and Moscow in particular targets U.S. influence around what it deems its own sphere of influence the former Soviet states, many of which are now members of NATO. \"Iran regards its alliance with Russia as a key strategic advantage in their international relations,\" said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \"Both parties are pushing back against Western sanctions and are revisionist, anti-status quo powers seeking to change the orders and power structures in their regions and in the world beyond,\" Ibish said. \"They're very close, and with Russia's new isolation, more dependent on each other than ever.\"\n\nA drone launch during a military exercise in an undisclosed location in Iran captured in a handout image obtained on Aug. 25, 2022. Iranian Army | West Asia News Agency | via Reuters\n\nHe added, \"Iran also seeks to become a major weapons exporter, adding another source of foreign exchange to their limited coffers.\" Iran is reportedly preparing to sell Russia more attack drones as well as its indigenously made ballistic missiles, and a top Iranian general said during a speech in mid-October that 22 countries are looking to buy its drones. Iran's foreign minister has denied the reports about potential missile shipments, calling them \"completely wrong.\" But it's often the case in Iran that the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military entity that answers only to the supreme leader, makes decisions on weapons and overseas conflicts independently of the Foreign Ministry.\n\nHow it could backfire\n\nIran's weapons support to Russia could trigger yet more Western sanctions in fact, it already has. The U.S. and EU have sanctioned several people and entities in Iran over its drone sales to Russia, and Kyiv has downgraded its diplomatic ties with Tehran. And \"it could backfire if its weapons prove faulty or ineffective,\" Ibish said, although there isn't any major evidence of this so far.\n\nA drone launch from an Iranian military ship in the Indian ocean, Iran, captured in a handout image obtained on July 15, 2022. Iranian Army | Via Reuters\n\nRane's Bohl added that Iran's drone shipments can also create blowback for Russia by incentivizing the West to send more advanced air defense systems to Ukraine. \"Such systems could become a big headache for the Russians and could make Iran's drones and missiles look ineffective while teaching Western militaries how better to counter them,\" he said. The apparent support for Russia further isolates Iran from the international community, which has condemned its violent crackdown against a female-led protest movement, sparked by the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini while in police custody.\n\nA game-changer?\n\nStill, conflict analysts say, the drones themselves are not likely to turn the tide of the war for Russia, which has struggled to make significant territorial gains for months now and has been pushed back in many areas by Ukrainian counteroffensives. \"Overall, [the drones] are not a game changer because while they can carry out precision strikes against civilian infrastructure and individual units, they can't reverse the loss of territory that Russia has been enduring since the Kharkiv offensive,\" Bohl said. \"Russia needs troops on the ground who are trained and capable and it simply doesn't have that despite mobilization.\" But if Iran sends ballistic missiles to Russia, that changes the calculus, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military personnel stand guard next to two Iranian Kheibar Shekan allistic missiles in downtown Tehran as demonstrators wave Iranian and Syrian flags during a rally commemorating the International Quds Day, also known as the Jerusalem day, on April 29, 2022.

Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones.\n\nThis new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russias war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nThe Iranian drones are known as a \"loitering munition\" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets.\n\nSending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is not going to \"waste our time\" on talks to revive the nuclear deal \"if nothings going to happen.\" Tehrans support for Russia in the Ukraine war and its crackdown on nationwide protests prompted by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September have prompted the US to impose further sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehrans direct engagement in the conflict.\n\n\"We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,\" Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nMalley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday.\n\n\"We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that its happening,\" Malley said.\n\nOn Monday a senior US defense official said they didnt have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has \"concerns\" that Russia may \"seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,\" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,\" Ryder said.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraines Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has \"no effective defense against these (surface-to-surface) missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have.\"\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it \"has not and will not\" do so.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report Irans plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia.\n\nThe US is \"looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions\" in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is \"trying to break up these networks.\"\n\nBut it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia.\n\nUS officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered.\n\nLast month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to \"target producers and procurers\" contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Departments Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said.\n\nThe question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry including more advanced missiles to Russia.",

                "cc_text": "Preparations to dismantle Odesas controversial Catherine the Great monument began in early November, with the site cordoned off and the figure of the Russian empress covered in a decidedly undignified shroud of black plastic. While final confirmation of Catherines removal is still pending, her fate appears to be sealed. She has fallen victim to radical changes in public opinion as Vladimir Putins brutal invasion forces Ukrainians to re-evaluate attitudes toward their countrys imperial Russian past.\n\nThe Catherine the Great statue in Ukrainian Black Sea port city Odesa has long been one of the countrys most politically controversial monuments. It was unveiled in 2007 during an escalation in Ukraines post-Soviet memory wars following the countrys landmark 2004 Orange Revolution. While patriotic Ukrainians were busy erecting monuments to figures from the countrys formerly outlawed national liberation movement, Odesas decision to honor the Russian empress with a statue was widely viewed as a defiant and deliberate demonstration of pride in the imperial past.\n\nIn the wake of Russias 2014 invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities passed a series of decommunization laws that led to the dismantling of thousands of Soviet era monuments across the country and the renaming of streets, villages, and entire cities. However, this legislation did not apply to the Czarist era and had no impact on the status of Odesas Catherine monument.\n\nAlthough there were no legal grounds for the removal of Catherine, her continued presence often sparked political conflicts within Odesa society and on the national stage. This tension reflected growing demands to reassess the nature of Ukraines relationship with Russia as a new generation of Ukrainians increasingly questioned the imperial dogmas established by centuries of Czarist and Soviet official histories.\n\nMany also objected specifically to Catherine and pointed to her personal role as a key figure in the subjugation of Ukraine. While the Russian empress is known internationally as Catherine the Great, significant numbers of Ukrainians object to this title and regard her instead as a notorious tyrant. They note that Catherine extinguished the broad autonomy of the Ukrainian Cossacks and oversaw the aggressive colonization of Ukraine.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nCatherines eighteenth century reign is closely associated with the imperial myths that now serve as historical justification for Vladimir Putins campaign to reconquer Ukraine and destroy Ukrainian statehood. Under Catherine, Russian imperial power expanded into southern Ukraine and Crimea, with the Czarist authorities posing as pioneers and founders of towns and cities such as Odesa that in reality had already existed in one form or another for centuries.\n\nIt was during this period that Catherines favorite, Grigory Potemkin, is said to have erected the infamous \"Potemkin Villages\" along the banks of Ukraines Dnipro River in order to create the false impression of a prosperous and happy colony for the visiting empress. Some historians now believe the legend of the Potemkin Villages may itself be a fabrication, but critics of Catherine nevertheless see it as fitting that her oppressive conquest of Ukraine is associated with one of historys most notorious political deceptions. To them, she is anything but \"great.\"\n\nDespite this challenging legacy, Odesas Catherine the Great monument was broadly popular among residents of the Black Sea port city until the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022. This popularity was not based on support for her actions against Ukrainian statehood or Cossack autonomy; instead, Catherine served as a symbol of the imperial identity that many in Odesa embraced following the Soviet collapse. She embodied the sense of pride Odesites felt over the prominent place occupied by their hometown in Russian imperial history.\n\nAttitudes have changed dramatically since February 24. The shock and trauma of Russias invasion has convinced many Odesites to abandon their previous enthusiasm for the citys Russian imperial heritage and has sparked a surge in public demands for the removal of Catherine.\n\nIt is not hard to see why. From the early days of the invasion, it has been clear that Odesa is one of the Russian armys primary objectives. The citys port has been blockaded by the Russian Black Sea fleet, with the nearby coastline fortified in anticipation of a possible Russian amphibious landing. Inside the city itself, Odesites have grown used to the daily terror of missile airstrikes and kamikaze drone attacks.\n\nFor Putin, Odesa has enormous strategic and symbolic importance. Capturing the port city would allow him to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea altogether and strangle the Ukrainian economy. Most analysts agree that without Odesa, Ukraine would no longer be economically viable as an independent state. The city could also serve as an excellent launch pad for the Russian occupation of Moldova.\n\nOdesas place in the Russian imagination also makes it a particularly valuable prize. Many of Putins compatriots view Odesa as a sacred Russian city and bitterly resent its present status as the southern capital of independent Ukraine. They regard Odesa as even more deeply entwined in Russian national identity than Crimea or Kyiv and sincerely believe the citys return to Kremlin rule would help correct the injustice of the post-Soviet settlement.\n\nCrucially, Putin has harked back to Catherine the Great in his attempts to provide historical justification for the invasion of Ukraine and the capture of Odesa. Likewise, Kremlin officials and regime proxies have actively revived the term \"Novorossiya\" (\"New Russia\"), which was coined during Catherines reign to refer to her imperial possessions in southern Ukraine. In areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces, Catherines legacy has been used to legitimize the Kremlins claims. This is part of a conscious attempt to change the optics of the invasion and portray Russia as liberator rather than an aggressor.\n\nUnfortunately for Putin, Odesites have shown little interest in being liberated by him or his soldiers. On the contrary, they have rallied to the defense of their city and have loudly condemned the Russian invasion. One of the many ways in which Odesites have expressed their opposition to Russias imperial aggression is by demanding the removal of the citys Catherine the Great monument.\n\nThe Odesa authorities were initially hesitant to bow to public pressure, with Odesa City Council refusing in September to support a proposal to dismantle the Catherine monument. However, following an online public vote, Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Truhanov announced on November 5 that he would now back calls for the removal of the statue. On day later, the monument was fenced in and a notice from the municipal authorities appeared announcing that it would soon be dismantled.\n\nSkeptics caution that the saga of Odesas Catherine the Great monument may still be far from over and warn that recent steps could simply be a stalling tactic to ease tensions and prevent further embarrassing acts of vandalism. However, the symbolism of Odesas boarded up Russian empress is already undeniable and reflects the citys decisive turn away from the imperial myth-making that Putin has tried so hard to exploit.\n\nThe Kremlin has sought to win Odesites over with a highly sanitized and largely mythical version of history, but Moscows appeals to imperial nostalgia have clearly fallen flat. While Putins Russia remains trapped in the past, todays Ukraine is building its identity around a compelling vision of the countrys future as an increasingly self-confident European democracy. This has proved far more persuasive to Odesites than the authoritarianism, isolation, and endless aggression offered by the Putin regime.\n\nFor decades, Odesa was arguably Ukraines most Russophile city. However, the current invasion has made Russia so toxic that even formerly sympathetic Odesites no longer want anything to do with Moscows imperial agenda. Putin claims to be waging war in order to return \"historic Russian lands,\" but in reality he has only succeeded in convincing Ukrainians that there is no place for Russia in their countrys future, and no place for Russian Empress Catherine the Great in a free Odesa.\n\nOleksiy Goncharenko is a member of the Ukrainian parliament with the European Solidarity party.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

Despite rhetorical consternation and calls for a peaceful resolution, neither has shown a willingness to meaningfully push back against Putins escalations in Ukraine. Instead, the two Asian nuclear powers are approaching the situation with caution and calculated diplomacy to preserve their own strategic interests both in Russia and the West.\n\nHowever, Putins nuclear brinksmanship is putting Beijing's and New Delhis balancing act in the spotlight. If Putin were to follow through on his numerous threats and use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the resulting international outcry could force India and China to reassess their approach to the war. How might the first use of a nuclear weapon in nearly eight decades tip the scales in Beijing and New Delhi?\n\nUSIPs Andrew Scobell, Alex Stephenson and Vikram Singh look at how China and India have navigated the wars geopolitical repercussions so far, how leaders in Beijing and New Delhi might respond to a Russian nuclear escalation in Ukraine and what effect it would have on their own nuclear doctrines.\n\nHow Russias Escalation in Ukraine Might Affect China\n\nScobell and Stephenson: While the West has expressed deep concern over Vladimir Putins recent statement that he would not rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Beijing has remained noticeably silent.\n\nUndoubtedly, the employment of a Russian tactical nuke would pose a dilemma for China. The international backlash alone could force Beijing to rethink its \"no limits\" partnership with Moscow. But a Russian strike would also go against Chinas decades-old nuclear policy.\n\nChinas No-First-Use Policy\n\nSince detonating its first nuclear device in 1964, China has pursued a no-first-use policy, as well as a strategy of deterrence through \"assured retaliation.\" Thus, for nearly six decades, Chinese leaders have viewed the role of nuclear weapons as limited to self-defense and as distinct from conventional operations and doctrine.\n\nThis position was reaffirmed last week by Li Song, the Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs, who said, \"China has solemnly committed to no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance.\"\n\nHowever, there have been recent signals that Beijing has elevated the role of nuclear weapons and integrated strategic deterrence in its overall military strategy.\n\nFor example, China has been growing its nuclear arsenal at an accelerated rate since at least 2021. And in his delivery of the work report at the recent 20th National Party Congress, Xi Jinping also proclaimed the need for China to build a strong \"strategic deterrence system.\" Instead of pointing to any legitimate change in its position on the use of nuclear weapons, however, these developments point more to Beijings changing perception of the international environment. Thus, if Russia employed a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukraine, Beijing would feel the need to publicly react, if only rhetorically.\n\nWhat a Nuclear Strike Would Mean for China-Russia Relations\n\nAlthough use of a nuclear weapon by Moscow would thrust Beijing into an extremely awkward situation, this would not necessarily prompt China to completely abandon its strategic partnership with Russia. While the China-Russia strategic partnership is certainly not without issues, it will probably continue as long as leaders in Beijing and Moscow both view the United States as their primary threat which is unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nSome have pointed to recent events such as Putins acknowledgement of Chinas \"questions and concerns\" about his war in Ukraine as evidence of cracks in the Sino-Russian relationship. But that is wishful thinking. In a recent meeting with Russian leaders, Chinas third-ranked leader, Li Zhanshu, expressed tacit support for the war in Ukraine, saying, \"We fully understand the necessity of all the measures taken by Russian aimed at protecting its key interests.\"\n\nIn all likelihood, Lis remarks accurately reflect Beijings position on the war. And just last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov where the two discussed \"the high level of mutual trust and firm mutual support between China and Russia,\" reaffirming Beijings commitment to the Sino-Russian relationship in the wake of Putins threats.\n\nThe recent work report at the National Party Congress also expressed a bleaker outlook on the international environment than its predecessors. The \"period of strategic opportunity,\" which has dominated party narratives in the last decade, is now fraught with \"risks\" and \"challenges,\" pointing to the threat posed by the United States.\n\nTo this end, Beijing is likely to tolerate further escalation in Ukraine short of a nuclear strike. Moreover, one cannot rule out the possibility that China will maintain its alignment with Russia even if the latter employed a tactical nuclear weapon. Beijings response may depend on the specific circumstances and Moscows justification for its use.\n\nBeijings Reaction to International Backlash\n\nXi Jinping has warned that China must \"be prepared to deal with worse-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters and even dangerous storms.\" If Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon, this would certainly constitute a dangerous storm, if not a worst-case scenario.\n\nChinese leaders would like to avoid that worst-case scenario if possible. In recent weeks, they have signaled their unease with Russias nuclear rhetoric and tried to dissuade Moscow from further threats albeit indirectly. A small step in the right direction came last week during a bilateral meeting between German Chancellor Olaf Schulz and Xi, where the two leaders discussed the war in Ukraine and reaffirmed that the international community should \"oppose the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\" Another proactive move would be for a Chinese official to publicly reaffirm the recent joint statement by the five nuclear-weapon states on preventing nuclear war.\n\nChina wants to increase its \"international standing and influence\" and \"play a greater role in global governance\" according to its recent work report. If Moscow were to actually launch a nuclear strike, the subsequent international backlash would force Beijing to express some level of criticism or condemnation in order to project itself as a responsible great power with moral authority and conviction.\n\nSuch a scenario would undoubtedly serve as a major test for Sino-Russian relations, but it is by no means clear that China would completely rupture ties. Over the last decade, Beijing has increasingly used its influence in the United Nations and other multilateral organizations to deftly preempt, avoid or deflect international criticisms on a range of controversial issues from the mistreatment of Uyghurs and other Muslims in Chinas Xinjiang region to Russian atrocities against Ukraine.\n\nEven amid monumental international outrage, Beijing may feel confident enough in its ability to evade substantial blowback that it only offers a rhetorical response to a Russian nuclear strike. Chinese leaders have repeatedly tried to cast the United States and NATO as instigators in the Ukraine conflict to shift attention from Russia. Its possible the Sino-Russian relationship could weather the storm if Beijing were to spin the resulting outrage in a similar way and such a route would allow China to position itself as a mature and principled great power intent on seeking win-win solutions.\n\nHow Russias Nuclear Escalation Might Affect India\n\nSingh: In reacting to Russias invasion of Ukraine, New Delhi has remained neutral on key votes at the United Nations and called for peace without casting blame on Moscow. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even publicly told Russian President Putin that \"todays era is not the era of war\" and encouraged him to bring the conflict to a close. But New Delhi has no intention of severing ties with Moscow, and Indian officials have been transparent about the constraints they operate under, particularly Indias dependence on military equipment of Russian origin.\n\nInstead, Indian officials have held to a middle line throughout the war sending humanitarian assistance to Ukraine while attempting to offset the economic impact of the war by purchasing Russian energy and fertilizer, among other actions.\n\nBut unlike China, which has doubled down on support of Moscow in the weeks after its National Party Congress, Indian leaders view the precedent-breaking assault on Ukraine as a threat to Indias own security. By invading Ukraine, Indias long-time partner has cast aside the core values that India relies on to protect itself from aggression by neighbors. The use of a nuclear weapon by Russia against Ukraine would bring about a crisis for Indian policymakers and make Indias current tightrope walk untenable.\n\nIndia first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974, calling it a \"peaceful nuclear explosion.\" Its nuclear doctrine has been to have a minimum credible deterrent and a no-first-use policy. For Indian military planners, nuclear weapons exist to deter combat, not as war-fighting tools. While some Indian leaders have floated the idea of adjusting the no-first-use policy to increase uncertainty and enhance deterrence, especially vis--vis Pakistan, no changes have been made to this doctrine.\n\nMoscow is Indias oldest and most reliable defense partner, notwithstanding Indias increased cooperation with the United States and its allies and partners over the past 20 years. But Moscow has deepened ties with China by announcing a \"no-limits\" partnership as Sino-India ties remain at their lowest point in over 40 years following clashes along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that claimed 20 Indian soldiers lives in 2020. Moscow has also increased outreach to Pakistan, which India views as its most consistent security threat.\n\nShould Moscow move forward with the first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II, it would challenge India in three primary ways:\n\n1. The collapse of global non-proliferation governance\n\nIn a normative sense, although it remains outside the U.N. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) framework, India abides by those long-held principles and wants them to survive. The 191-member NPT itself would be at risk if one of the five recognized nuclear-weapons states made unilateral and offensive use of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThis would force a deep reassessment of all Indian nuclear weapons strategy and doctrine. India would have to consider costly investments to upgrade and diversify its own nuclear weapons portfolio, which is smaller than that of either of its nuclear neighbors. With global non-proliferation governance shattered, India would likely seek to lead or actively participate in efforts to rebuild a global consensus against the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n2. Understanding Chinas and Pakistans responses to nuclear use by Russia\n\nFrom a demonstration standpoint, India would worry over how China and Pakistan respond. Indian leaders believe their nuclear deterrence with China is stable, even in the aftermath of Chinese aggression and occupation of disputed territory along the Line of Actual Control.\n\nWhile Indian leaders assume Beijings focus will be on implications for Taiwan, they cannot ignore the fact that China claims the entire Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and Beijing may reassess how new uncertainty around nuclear use could serve to coerce or deter. Planners in New Delhi will need to understand how their Chinese counterparts change their thinking about the threat or use of nuclear strikes going forward.\n\nPakistan does not have a no-first-use doctrine. Indian planners already account for possible Pakistani use of a tactical nuclear device against forward-deployed Indian forces in the case of full-scale war. Indian leaders will expect Putins use of a nuclear weapon to increase the likelihood of Pakistani nuclear use. In particular, they will plan against and seek to deter Pakistan from using tactical nukes, possibly on Pakistans own territory, to strike or block advancing Indian forces.\n\nFollowing recent terrorist attacks traced back to Pakistan, India has engaged in counterattacks inside Pakistani territory. During the last crisis between the two South Asian countries, Pakistan retaliated inside Indian-controlled Kashmir and downed an Indian fighter jet. For Indian officials, understanding any changes in Pakistani thinking on nuclear use will be critical to future decisions about how to respond to an attack.\n\n3. The future of Indias relationships with Russia and the West\n\nFinally, and most importantly, Indias relationships with Russia and the West would never be the same after a Russian nuclear attack in Ukraine. The horror and outrage in the United States and Europe would likely lead to a \"with us or against us\" moment, with Russia ejected fully from the global banking system, including SWIFT, as well as secondary sanctions that are more severe than the toughest sanctions ever placed on Iran.\n\nIndia would be outraged by Russia violating the longstanding norm against nuclear use, but it would seek a way to preserve core aspects of its relationship with Moscow. For one thing, despite increasing domestic production of arms and diversifying sources to include the United States, Europe and Israel, New Delhi remains deeply dependent on Russian military equipment and would require years or even decades to transition away from them completely. And it would be difficult for Western nations to help India rapidly field everything from new tanks to missiles to submarines. For Indian leaders, navigating the sustainment of their Russian materiel while avoiding western sanctions may prove impossible. The United States, in particular, would probably sanction India like any other country should it continue to purchase Russian arms and spare parts in the aftermath of nuclear use.\n\nChina does not rely on Russia for most of its materiel and will likely seek to keep its partnership intact even if Xi criticizes the use of a nuclear weapon. In a worst-case scenario from the U.S. standpoint, China and Russia may partner in response to Western sanctions and invite India to join an alternative economic and political framework that manages transactions without the use of the U.S. dollar or global banking system. China, like India, has been reluctant to violate sanctions against Russia, but both countries have tested mechanisms for settling payments with Russia in local currency or through barter.\n\nOutside of Ukraine itself, India and other low-to-middle income countries are bearing the brunt of the cost of Russias aggression. Higher fuel, fertilizer and food costs are driving increases in poverty and hunger. Indian leaders believe they have a better chance of having a positive impact on ending this war by keeping their criticism of Putin mostly private. The specter of nuclear use and catastrophic impact it could have on Indias interests may lead them to push Russia to find a way out of its self-made quagmire.",

But Moscow's suspension of the initiative would be tantamount to collective punishment for the rest of the world.\"\n\nPrice noted that the suspension especially affects lower and middle income countries, which have been the recipients of the vast majority of grain coming out of the deal. Two-thirds, or 66%, of the grain has gone to developing countries, with 19% going to the least developed countries of the world, according to Price.\n\n\"It is not in anyone's interests. It is not in Russia's interest. It is not in the interest of the international community to see what could be akin to a form of collective global punishment now for this to remain suspended,\" he said.\n\nPrice put full U.S. support behind the United Nations, which helped to initially broker the deal, in its efforts to maintain the humanitarian corridor and encourage cooperation between Russia and Ukraine over grain exports.\n\n\"We are going to support the Secretary General in any way that we can, as he seeks to have this grain initiative resume and to add a degree of longevity to it,\" Price said.\n\nRocio Fabbro",

Chanting to the tune of Queen's We Will Rock You, the activists called for Putin and his army to target \"the decision-making centres\" in retaliation for the support shown to Ukraine. Footage from the Russian capital showed the group walking down the street chanting and waving banners supporting Russian troops involved in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nA man leading the protest said: \"Strike the decision-making centres. On Washington. Strike the decision-making centres. On Washington. \"A flight task for Sarmat missiles. Sarmat, strike the enemy's cities. On Washington. The USA is the enemy. \"We will go to heaven as martyrs. They will simply croak. Take your aim, Ivan! Launch the Akhmat.\" Support for Vladimir Putin has remained strong despite pockets of protests emerging since he announced the conscription of 300,000 men in September. JUST IN: Putin reeling as Russian 'headquarters' obliterated, leaving 80 dead\n\nThe protesters urged Russia to launch a Sarmat missile against Washington\n\nRussia has been forced on the backfoot by Ukraine\n\nFootage of conscripts has been circulating online showing troops threatening to mutiny after receiving no payment, no training and no equipment to fight against the Ukrainians. And earlier this week Moscow announced soldiers would be withdrawn from Kherson as Ukraine's defence force continues to advance eastwards. Ukraine is yet to claim the city is back in Ukrainian hands, but the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky said \"life is returning\". Russian forces still control about 70 percent of the wider Kherson region in the wake of the withdrawal.

The exit was formally announced on November 9, but the defence experts said it is likely it started as early as October 22. Moscow said: \"There is a realistic possibility that Russian military equipment and forces in civilian attire had been evacuating in conjunction with the 80,000 stated evacuated civilians in recent weeks.\" The Kremlin confirmed troops had crossed onto the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, with satellite imagery showing trenches being built.

The Pentagon announced a new package of $400 million in security assistance on Friday. Credit... Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON The Defense Department is setting up a new command to oversee how the United States and its allies train and equip the Ukrainian military, the Pentagon announced on Friday along with a new package of $400 million in security assistance.\n\nThe Pentagons commitment to supplying Ukraine with weaponry and the new command are clear signals that the United States expects the threat from Russia to Ukraine and its neighbors to persist for many years, current and former senior U.S. officials said.\n\nThe command will \"ensure we are postured to continue supporting Ukraine over the long term,\" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters at a news briefing. \"We remain committed to Ukraine for as long as it takes.\"\n\nIn the military, a command is a focused organization dedicated to a particular geographical or strategic area. The new command, called the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine, or SAG-U, will based in Germany and within the structure of the Pentagons European Command. With a staff of about 300 people, it will be focused on one mission: to help train and equip Ukraines military.\n\nThe new command will streamline a training and assistance system that was created on the fly after the Russian invasion in February. The Times reported in September that the new structure was in the works.\n\nThe revamped assistance program will be led by a high-ranking general who will replace Lt. Gen. Christopher T. Donahue, the head of the Armys 18th Airborne Corps, who has coordinated much of the U.S. military assistance to Ukraine from behind the scenes over the past several months.\n\nA leading candidate to take over the new position is Lt. Gen. Antonio A. Aguto, Jr., the head of the First U.S. Army headquarters, located at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, military officials said.\n\nThe additional $400 million in security assistance includes, for the first time, funding to refurbish 45 tanks from the Czech Republic, which will start arriving in Ukraine by the end of December, Ms. Singh said. The funding also will go to contracts for 1,100 Phoenix Ghost drones and an additional 40 riverine boats.\n\nThe latest announcement brings to $18.9 billion the amount in military assistance that the United States has committed to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The funds comprise a combination of immediate shipments from stockpiles as well as contracts for weapons to be delivered over the next three years.\n\nOver the past several months, General Donahue, who commanded the American evacuation from Afghanistan in August 2021, has helped oversee training in Ukraine, talking to Ukrainian generals about their battlefield needs and drawing on his Special Operations background to advise his Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nGeneral Donahue and his staff have been deployed to Poland and Germany since the early days of the war. His staff recently returned to its main headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., where they were greeted this week by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III. General Donahue will remain in Germany until his successor arrives, Pentagon officials said.\n\nThe new command, which will report to Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the top American officer in Europe, will carry out the decisions made by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of 40 countries that the Defense Department created after the Russian invasion to address Ukraines needs and requests. Senior military officials from the member nations met in Brussels this week.\n\nThe changes, which aim to give a formal structure to what has been improvised since the wars onset, are roughly modeled on U.S. train-and-assist efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past two decades.",

Headquarters in New York City, September 21, 2022.\n\nUkrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska made an impassioned speech on Tuesday calling on the global technology community to aid her country and combat Russia's invasion.\n\nSpeaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Zelenska told attendees that technology has become \"battlefield\" in the Russian war against Ukraine. Russia \"puts technology at the service of terror,\" she said.\n\n\"Technology has in many ways brought us closer together through social media and messenger apps,\" Zelenska said Tuesday evening.\n\n\"But imagine, all of a sudden a social media account stops getting updated, the person running it no longer responds to messages. And then you see their black and white photos and you know the unthinkable has happened. During this month, thousands of Ukrainian social media accounts will never be updated again. Those people are gone.\"\n\nShe called on tech entrepreneurs and investors to invest in Ukraine's tech and science sectors and make donations to her Olena Zelenska Foundation. Launched in September, the foundation aims to restore Ukrainian hospitals and schools that have been destroyed in the war. Children \"should be flying to Mars, not running to their basements\" to flee Russian shelling in war shelters, Zelenska said.\n\n\"You are the force that moves the world,\" she said. \"You have the potential and technologies that can help, not destroy; by helping Ukraine, you can move the world in the right direction.\"\n\nBefore Zelenska was due to speak, Paddy Cosgrave, Web Summit's founder, launched an attack on Ireland's government over Russia. He said it has allowed certain Russian actors to avoid facing sanctions.\n\n\"The Irish government has for years lobbied both Brussels and the White House so that certain Russian oligarchs might be exempted from both U.S. and EU sanctions,\" Cosgrave, who has long been critical of the Irish government, said onstage at Web Summit.\n\n\"My message is simple, how can Ireland help Ukraine stop bankrolling Russian oligarchs?\" he added.\n\nFor its part, Ireland says it is opposed to Russia's war against Ukraine and has joined its European Union alies in imposing strict sanctions on Moscow.\n\nRyan Browne",
