This has been a consistent strategy, with Russian missiles repeatedly aiming at Ukraine's energy facilities, an action that Ukrainian officials and some international leaders have labeled as potential war crimes (6,7). The attacks have had a profound impact on civilian life, directly affecting millions by crippling the power grid that supplies homes and businesses, and have been recognized as an attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people (7)."

The intensity of these attacks peaked again in recent weeks, with over 120 missiles fired in one of the biggest waves of strikes, as reported on December 17, 2022 (4). These strikes have not only been aimed at military targets but have also damaged power stations and other critical infrastructure, exacerbating the difficulties faced by civilians during the winter (5). Notably, the Ukrainian Prime Minister reported that 40% of the network facilities transporting electricity had been damaged, affecting power delivery (9).

These attacks are part of a larger pattern of strikes aimed at Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure during the winter, exacerbating the hardship for civilians and potentially hindering military operations by targeting power stations (1,3). The choice of targets within Kyiv could also be intended to disrupt the command and control capabilities of Ukraine, which is a critical first step in the military doctrine that emphasizes gaining air superiority and isolating areas before direct ground operations (5). Moreover, these attacks serve as a reminder of the ongoing conflict and the pressure that Russia is attempting to maintain on Ukrainian defenses and morale, despite recent Ukrainian successes on the battlefield that have seen Russian forces retreat from key areas (4).",

The targeting of these districts by Russian forces could be part of a broader strategy to weaken Ukrainian command and control and to hamper the country's ability to respond to aerial and ground operations. This is evidenced by the broader pattern of Russian strikes aimed at critical energy infrastructure and military command centers across Ukraine, which have been part of a sustained effort to degrade Ukraine's military capabilities and civilian morale during the freezing winter weather (1,3,8).\n\nMoreover, the strikes on Kyiv's districts align with Russia's overarching military doctrine, which emphasizes establishing air superiority, disrupting enemy command and control, and isolating areas of operation to support ground troop movements (5). By hitting these districts, Russia could be attempting to interrupt the mobilization and coordination of Ukrainian forces within the capital, which is vital for Ukraine's defense and counter-offensive operations (4,5). Additionally, the attacks on Kyiv's infrastructure are part of a pattern of Russian operations that target energy facilities, aiming to create widespread disruptions to electricity and heating during a critical time of year, thereby putting additional pressure on Ukraine's government and military (7,9)."

The Russians have moved their command and control nodes and weapons depots out of the 80-mile range of HIMARS batteries to points further south in Crimea, said one person familiar with Ukrainian battlefield assessments.",

During a significant Russian missile attack, Ukraine's top general reported that air defenses managed to shoot down 60 out of 76 missiles, showcasing a high success rate in neutralizing threats to critical infrastructure (1). Additionally, Ukrainian forces have been able to adapt advanced weaponry such as the AGM-88 HARM ARM to further bolster their air defense capabilities, indicating a move towards utilizing more sophisticated systems to counter assaults on civilian populations (4). Moreover, the Ukrainian military has had repeated successes in downing missiles and drones, with the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv acknowledging the air defense's efforts amid escalatory attacks (6).\n\nHowever, despite the high interception rates in some instances, the pressure on Ukraine's air defense remains intense with large-scale attacks causing \"colossal\" damage and threatening essential services like heating during winter (1). The Ukrainian military claimed to have intercepted 54 out of 69 missiles in a recent wave of strikes, which aligns with their continued effective use of air defenses in urban areas (8,10). The effectiveness of the Ukrainian air defense is also supported by the use of HIMARS systems, which have been deadly accurate in targeting Russian positions, forcing Russian forces to adjust their tactics and move assets out of reach (7). Nonetheless, the effectiveness is not absolute, as cities still endure periods without heat, electricity, or internet following attacks, and the increasing time between Russian strikes suggests a possible rationing of missile supplies, adding a layer of unpredictability to the defense efforts (9)."

                "summary": "Continued missile attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, could lead to devastating long-term consequences for the city's security and stability. The relentless targeting of energy supply facilities has already resulted in substantial damage, with an estimated 40% of Ukraine's network facilities transporting electricity being affected, which poses a threat to both civilian life and the national economy (1,2). Such attacks can have far-reaching impacts, including the loss of civilian lives, the destruction of critical infrastructure, and the hampering of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' operational capabilities (1). If these assaults persist, they could lead to sustained emergency blackouts, further undermining the city's stability and potentially hindering the defense against the aggression (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The ongoing missile attacks on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine have had severe impacts on the country's energy infrastructure and civilian population, with 40% of the network facilities transporting electricity being damaged, leading to widespread power outages and emergency blackouts (2,5). The attacks, which have been described as one of the largest since the start of the war, have not only resulted in the loss of lives but have also severely disrupted the living conditions of residents, with a significant portion of Kyiv's population facing challenges in heating supply (5,6). If these missile attacks persist, they threaten to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis by leaving millions without access to essential services during harsh winter conditions, further crippling the national economy and impeding the Ukrainian government's ability to maintain stability and security within the city (1,5,6).\n\nMoreover, the continuous assaults on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure by Russia, using both cruise missiles and attack UAVs, underscore the precariousness of the relative parity achieved in the air and highlight the difficulties in countering missile threats (1). The introduction of more modern defense systems, such as the reported U.S. plan to send advanced Patriot missile systems, could be critical in bolstering Kyiv's defensive capabilities, though Russia has warned of unspecified \"consequences\" for such actions (7). The long-term consequences for Kyiv's security and stability include the potential for sustained humanitarian challenges, economic decline due to the devastation of critical infrastructure, and an ongoing threat to civilian life, compounded by the potential for escalating military responses as international support for Ukraine's defense capabilities grows (1,2,5,7)."

                "summary": "The missile strikes in Kyiv have heightened international condemnation, with analysts suggesting the attacks have damaged Moscow's reputation and raised questions about its defense capabilities (1). Officials such as the UK ambassador to Ukraine and the president of Moldova have labeled Russia's actions as indicative of a desire not for peace but for the subjugation of Ukraine, calling the strikes barbaric and unprovoked (4). These attacks, aimed at civilian infrastructure, have not weakened Ukrainian resolve but have prompted calls for increased support, including the need for the U.S. to recognize Russia's actions as genocide and provide Ukraine with critical weapons to potentially end the conflict (2,3). Despite the hardship caused, Russia's strategy of targeting civilian infrastructure has not led to military success on the ground, and Putin is not yet ready to concede defeat (5).",
                "more_detailed": "The barrage of missile strikes by Russia on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, has led to intensified international condemnation and a push for further sanctions against Moscow. The United Kingdom's ambassador to Kyiv called the attacks indicative of Russia's desire for Ukraine's subjugation rather than peace, echoing Moldova's president's denouncement of the strikes as \"barbaric\" (4). In response to Russia's aggressive naval operations hindering maritime commerce, particularly affecting food and grain supplies, the United States announced sanctions targeting Russian naval entities connected to the conflict, signaling a continued escalation of diplomatic pressures (8).\n\nThese missile attacks, which have targeted civilian infrastructure, causing widespread power outages and civilian casualties, have not gone unnoticed by global powers. The United States has responded by providing significant aid to Ukraine, though there have been calls for it to further recognize Russia's actions as genocide and to provide Kyiv with more advanced weapons systems like HIMARS, despite concerns of provoking a larger conflict (3). Meanwhile, the relentless assaults on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure have galvanized a reaffirmation of support from the international community, with allies like Germany shifting their stance on projects like Nord Stream II and recognizing the need for a unified front against what is increasingly viewed as an imperialist land grab by Putin's Russia (6)."

The governor of the central region of Dnipropetrovsk reported \"serious damage\".\n\nAir defences took out 60 out of 76 incoming missiles fired at critical infrastructure, Ukraine's top general said. Moscow deliberately tried to distract the air defences by flying warplanes near Ukraine, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said.\n\n\"They want to destroy us, and make us slaves. But we will not surrender. We will endure,\" said Lidiya Vasilieva, 53, as she headed for shelter at a Kyiv railway station. \"I want the war over and soon. But I am ready to wait as long as needed.\"\n\nThree people were killed in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, authorities said, and a fourth died in a fire in the southern Kherson region after an apartment block was hit by shelling before the missile strike.\n\nThe attack in Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's hometown, also wounded at least 13 people, including four small children, a senior official said.\n\nGrid operator Ukrenergo warned that repair times would be longer compared with previous ones and that it would take longer to restore power.\n\n\"What we already see is damage to about nine (power) generating facilities. Now we are still verifying the damage,\" Energy Minister German Galushchenko told national television.\n\n[1/10]Rescuers work at the site of a residential building damaged by a Russian missile, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine December 16, 2022. REUTERS/Mykola Synelnykov Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nThe central city of Poltava and parts of Kyiv were among areas where power was knocked out. Critical infrastructure was hit in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, the Black Sea region of Odesa and in Vinnytsia in west central Ukraine.\n\nThree loud blasts were heard in Kyiv and smoke wafted overhead, Reuters witnesses said. Some railway lines were left without power.\n\n\"There is colossal damage to infrastructure, primarily the energy system,\" Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. \"I ask you to be patient with what is happening now. I know that in your houses there is no light, no heating, no water supply.\"\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Zelenskiy's office, said emergency power shutdowns had been introduced nationwide to enable repairs.\n\nUKRAINE REMAINS DEFIANT\n\nThe initial air alert in Kyiv was lifted four hours after it was announced as children made their way to school and people travelled to work.\n\nThe cavernous Kyiv metro system, which has one of the deepest stations in the world, stopped functioning and was used as a bomb shelter.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine in February, Moscow says attacks on basic infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime.\n\n\"The goal of the Russian Federation is for Ukrainians to be constantly under pressure, to go down into bomb shelters almost every day, to feel discomfort due to power outages or water interruptions,\" Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"But Ukraine's position is unchanged: let it be without light, but #withoutyou. We will endure. We will win. We will rebuild.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic and Pavel Polityuk, Editing by Timothy Heritage\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Otherwise, the issue will be decided by the Russian army,\" Lavrov said.\n\nAsked by TASS how long the conflict will last, Lavrov said: \"The ball is in the regimes court and Washington behind it.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin again said Moscow was open to negotiations and blamed Kyiv and its Western backers for a lack of talks, comments which the US has dismissed as insincere.\n\nAs the war enters its 11th month and despite myriad battlefield setbacks for Moscow, Russian forces are engaged in fierce fighting in the east and south of Ukraine while Russias missile and drone attacks have devastated Ukraines civil infrastructure, leaving millions without power, heating and water.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address on Monday that the situation at the front in the Donbas region was \"difficult and painful\" and required all of the countrys \"strength and concentration\". He said that as a result of Russias targeting of Ukraines energy infrastructure, nearly nine million people were now without electricity. That figure amounts to about a quarter of Ukraines population.\n\nTens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians have also been killed in cities Russia razed to the ground, and thousands of troops on both sides have died.\n\nHosting leaders of former Soviet states in St Petersburg on Monday for a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States group, Putin made no direct reference to the war in Ukraine while saying threats to the security and stability of the Eurasian region were increasing.\n\n\"Unfortunately challenges and threats in this area, especially from the outside, are only growing each year,\" he said.\n\nSince the invasion in February, Ukraine has driven Russian forces from the north, defeated them on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv and forced Russian retreats in the east and south. But Moscow still controls swathes of eastern and southern land Putin claims to have annexed.",

Three people were killed when an apartment block was hit in central Kryvyi Rih and another died in shelling in Kherson in the south, they said. Russian-installed officials in occupied eastern Ukraine said 12 people had died by Ukrainian shelling.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia still had enough missiles for several more massive strikes and he again urged western allies to supply Kyiv with more and better air defence systems. \"Whatever the rocket worshippers from Moscow are counting on, it still wont change the balance of power in this war,\" he said in an evening address.\n\nThe mass strikes appeared to be a continuation of the Kremlins attempt to destroy Ukraines energy infrastructure. Ukraines state energy company Ukrenergo said energy consumption had fallen by 50% as a result of the attacks. The company said Russia had hit thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and substations of main networks. Ukrenergo said it will take longer to repair the national grid and restore power than it did after previous Russian missile attacks, with priority given to \"critical infrastructure facilities\".\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said late on Friday that just a third of its residents had both heat and water and 40% electricity. The metro system - a crucial transport artery - remained shut down, he added.\n\nThe Kyiv city administration said Ukraines capital had withstood \"one of the biggest rocket attacks\" launched by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine nearly 10 months ago. The administration said Ukrainian air defence forces shot down 37 of \"about 40\" that entered the citys airspace. There were water disruptions in every district, Klitschko said.\n\nAt least eight people were killed and 23 injured by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled Luhansk region of Ukraine, Russias state Tass news agency reported on Friday, citing an unidentified source in the emergency services. The shelling destroyed a building in the village of Lantrativka and some people were trapped under rubble, Tass said. The head of the \"peoples militia\" in Luhansk also claimed there were civilian casualties as a result of Ukrainian shelling on the town of Svatove on Friday morning.\n\nThe White House has said the next security assistance package for Ukraine was coming and it was expected to include more air defence capabilities for the country. Russias foreign ministry warned this week that if the US delivered sophisticated Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine, such systems and any crews that accompany them would be a legitimate target for the Russian military. Washington rejected the threat.\n\nEU states should buy arms jointly to replenish stocks after supplying Ukraine, said the blocs defence agency, warning the US may not always be able to shield Europe from threats. \"The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine demonstrates our capability shortfalls,\" said Ji ediv, chief executive of the European Defence Agency. The agency was in talks with European arms firms about boosting production, he said, as well as with countries about clubbing together to buy equipment and ammunition.\n\nThe head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she welcomes the agreement by EU leaders on the ninth package of sanctions against Russia. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to provide 18bn in financing to Ukraine next year as well as to a fresh package of sanctions, which will designate nearly 200 more people and bar investment in Russias mining industry, among other steps. The Kremlin said it would study the latest package of EU sanctions and then formulate its response.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Friday. The Kremlin said Putin gave \"fundamental assessments\" of the conflict in Ukraine during the call, at Modis request. The Indian leaders office was cited as saying that he had reiterated his call for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way forward in the conflict.\n\nPutin will visit Belarus for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Monday. The pair will discuss Russian-Belarusian integration \"as well as current topics on the international and regional agenda\", the Kremlin said. Putin and Lukashenko will hold a one-on-one meeting in which they will \"give priority to security issues and exchange views on the situation in the region and the world\", Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta said, without mentioning Ukraine.",

At night, many cities plunge into darkness to save energy.\n\nRussian attacks target power grids\n\nUkraine has lost about half of its ability to generate electricity, Human Rights Watch reported. The biggest loss came after Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which accounts for at least 20% of the countrys generation capacity.\n\nSeveral thermal power plants are in territories now occupied by Russia. Military attacks have damaged nearly all of Ukraines thermal and hydroelectric power plants.\n\nElectricity has to be adjusted before its distributed across the power grid. Power plants generate electricity and send it to transformers, which increase the voltage so it can be carried by long-distance transmission lines. Those lines send the electricity to substations, which reduce the voltage so power lines can send it to homes and businesses.\n\nSubstations have been among the main targets of Russian missiles for several months, according to Maksim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, Ukraines largest private power generator. When they are damaged, power can't be delivered to the grids.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal estimated that 40% of Ukraine's network facilities transporting electricity from power stations to urban areas and towns have been damaged to varying degrees.\n\nOct. 10, 2022: A barrage of over 83 Russian missiles and drones partially disrupt power in 15 regions and the city of Kyiv.

USA TODAY illustration\n\nConsequences of attacks\n\nThe energy system becomes more fragile every time there's a new wave of attacks.\n\nAfter Russian attacks on Oct. 10-11, Ukraine had to suspend electricity exports to neighboring European states for an indefinite period.\n\nRussian shelling on Nov. 23 caused problems at Ukrainian nuclear power plants, according to Ukraine's ministry of energy.\n\nKhmelnytsky NPP was disconnected from the power system.\n\nRivne NPP was put into emergency operation mode.\n\nSouth Ukrainian NPP had an emergency shutdown of power units.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, nuclear power plants produce more than half of the countrys electricity.\n\nLiving in the darkness\n\nWhen a substation connecting the regions is hit, one region often gets a surplus of energy while another gets a deficit. Successive waves of attacks have led to a constant shortage in the Ukrainian energy network.\n\nTo maintain the balance between electrical generation and consumption, Ukraine's energy operator Ukrenergo has begun rolling blackouts, temporary power outages or reductions.\n\nCities in Ukraine strive to maintain a so-called normal power outage schedule of four-hour blocks of power three times a day.\n\nFar-reaching effects of power cuts\n\nDuring blackouts, there is often no cell service or internet access. Elevators don't run.\n\nPumping stations, which provide households with water, stop. It may take a while to get them started. Even then, not all city residents may get water back. The higher you live in a building, the more water pressure is needed to deliver water. It can take hours to return pressure in the water supply system to normal.\n\nUkrainian cities rely on a centralized heating system where vast networks of pipes carry steam and hot water to households. Large gas-fired boilers heat the water that circulates across the system. Residents of several cities lost heating after the Russian attack on Dec. 16 because boiler rooms lost power.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has opened more than 5,000 \"points of invincibility\" across the country where people charge their devices, access the internet and warm up. But these are not enough for a country with a prewar population of about 40 million.\n\nWithout electricity, electric trollies, buses and subway systems dont run. Traffic lights can't operate. The number of people killed in traffic accidents in the capital has increased sixfold after the rolling blackouts began, according to Kyiv police spokesman Andriy Molokoyedov.\n\nA car drives down a street with no lighting in Lviv during a blackout, on December 18, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. YURIY DYACHYSHYN, AFP via Getty Images\n\nRepairing grid faster than Russia strikes\n\nWinter conditions, in particular frost and freezing rain, complicate and prolong the grid repair. As crews race to restore basic utilities, new attacks threaten to undo their work.\n\nIt takes a minimum of six months to 18 months to manufacture a transformer, according to Olexander Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Centre, an independent research and consulting company. Transformers are also very large and difficult to transport.\n\nSome damage to energy infrastructure takes only a couple of hours to fix. However, if the attacks stopped, it would take up to three months for Ukraine to provide a 24-hour electricity supply to consumers, and the full recovery of the system would take up to three years, according to Kharchenko.\n\nAt the same time, according to Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, head of the board of Ukrenergo, a complete blackout of the whole country is unlikely.\n\n\"Our energy system is still intact and controlled by the Dispatch Center Ukrenergo,\" Kudrytskyi said. \"We are still far from an apocalyptic scenario. I don't even know how realistic this apocalypse is.\"\n\nContributing: George Petras",

Russia says the electricity grid is a legitimate military target in its \"special operation\".\n\nThe Pentagon has said Russia's missile strikes are partly designed to exhaust Kyiv's supplies of air defences and finally achieve dominance of the skies above the country.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Washington on Wednesday to seek \"weapons, weapons and more weapons\", including a Patriot missile battery that would shore up the country's defences against incoming missiles and drones.\n\nThe attacks on energy targets disrupt everyday life, including vital services like hospitals and schools, and threaten to further cripple the economy. It is already set to shrink by at least a third this year, as shops and heavy industry struggle to keep the lights on.\n\nRussia has launched nine, large-scale air attacks - usually firing more than 70 missiles at a time - since Oct. 10, knocking out power, running water, mobile signals and heating.\n\nUkraine's record of downing missiles has ranged from around 50% to as much as 85%, with more recent attacks coming closer to the higher end, according to Reuters calculations based on Ukrainian data.\n\nAfter the most recent attack on Friday it said it had shot down 60 out of 76 incoming missiles.\n\nStill, those which come through inflict serious damage. Ukraine was forced to implement emergency blackouts nationwide, and much of Kyiv region has been without power and water for several days.\n\n'CAT AND MOUSE'\n\nSpread thinly across a country double the size of Italy, air defence units are deployed mostly near cities and key infrastructure, while fighter pilots like Juice cover the expansive gaps in between.\n\nIt is a tall order. Juice says he has not shot down a single drone or missile in his MiG-29, which came off the assembly line before Ukraine won independence from Soviet Moscow in 1991.\n\n\"Our jets are not capable enough to do that efficiently,\" said the pilot, who is in a constant high state of readiness at a location in central Ukraine that he would not disclose.\n\nHe said it was hard spotting incoming targets with old radars, especially in the case of low-flying, slow-moving Shahed drones that look like moving trucks on the radar screen.\n\nOn occasions, like Dec. 5, Juice was unable to fire at targets because he was too close to densely populated areas.\n\nIt is ground-based air defence units that shoot down the vast majority of missiles and drones, not ageing warplanes, Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat said.\n\n[1/6]Rescuers work at the site of a maternity ward of a hospital destroyed by a Russian missile attack, as their attack on Ukraine continues, in Vilniansk, Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine November 23, 2022. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\n\"Both missiles and drones fly along the course of rivers to be as low as possible and disappear from radars. If they are low enough, they just disappear ... Then they pop up again; it's a game of cat and mouse,\" said Ihnat.\n\nAfter major missile barrages, a days-long pause tends to follow as Russian intelligence assesses what was hit and what was missed, tracks the repositioning of Ukrainian air defences and looks for weak spots to exploit, Ukrainian officials told Reuters.\n\n\"Air defences don't remain in one place: we can't cover the whole country...\" Ihnat said.\n\nFor Ukraine, intelligence gathering by both domestic and Western spy agencies plays a major role in preparing for Russian air strikes, Denys Smazhnyi, a senior air defence training official, told Reuters.\n\n\"So we usually know what objects are under attack, we can build around those objects some kind of air defence,\" he said.\n\nDWINDLING MISSILE STOCKS\n\nUkraine's military intelligence chief has estimated that Russia may only have enough high-precision weapons for few more major air strikes.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials also acknowledge that their own stocks of defensive weapons are dwindling as the invasion nears the 10-month mark.\n\nDespite Western supplies of air defence systems to Ukraine including the sophisticated U.S. NASAMS and German IRIS-T systems, Soviet-era systems make up the core of Ukrainian air defences, said Ihnat.\n\n\"Our Soviet air defence system is being depleted - that is the S-300 and the BUK, which are the foundation. We cannot maintain that indefinitely because all the unique spare parts of those systems are made in Russia,\" he added.\n\nWestern air defence systems supplied to Ukraine have performed well, but supplies are far short of what is needed, according to both air force officials.\n\n\"The Russian equipment is getting older; we are losing missiles. I'm not (saying) they will run out in a few days or a few weeks ... It will still depend on the intensity of the Russian attacks,\" said Smazhnyi.\n\nBy Dec. 7, Russia launched more than 1,000 missiles and rockets at Ukraine's power grid, its operator said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States announced $1.85 billion in additional military assistance for Ukraine, including a transfer of the Patriot Air Defense System, Smazhnyi said such systems would provide protection against ballistic missiles that Ukraine is now exposed to.\n\nIhnat said IRIS-T production was already at maximum capacity and that Ukraine should therefore focus on obtaining as many NASAMS supplies as it could.\n\n\"We're almost through one month of winter, we have one more and then February, which is short. I think we'll survive. But it's better to supply missiles than generators,\" he said.\n\nJuice, who speaks fluent English, said many of his peers in the Air Force were taking English lessons in their free time in anticipation that Ukraine would one day receive Western aircraft such as the U.S. F-16 multi-role fighter jet.\n\nThere has been no sign that any delivery of F-16 was imminent or agreed, and Ihnat said the pilots were acting on their own.\n\n\"Everyone understands that sooner or later we will switch to F-16s or some other type of plane and English knowledge will be needed.\"\n\nReporting by Tom Balmforth; editing by Mike Collett-White and Tomasz Janowski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

                "cc_text": "In an essay for the Atlantic Council published in December 2021, I stated that Europes future would be decided in Ukraine. One year on, what may earlier have seemed like a bold statement is now recognizable fact. Ukraine has become Europes shield, defending the continent along a 2,500-kilometer front line.\n\nWith each new success of the Ukrainian army, the threats facing NATO and the European Union diminish. Over the past ten months, Ukraine has destroyed a large number of Russian army units that have been training for decades to attack the West. Russias military potential will take years to recover. Ukraines heroism has won Europe precious time to rethink its approach to security and defense.\n\nThis reevaluation should begin with a frank reflection on the events of the past twelve months. Every single prewar Ukrainian warning regarding the likely consequences of a full-scale Russian invasion has come to pass, from millions of refugees to global energy and food crises. One year ago, Germanys leaders were still insisting the Nord Stream II pipeline was a purely economic project. It is now painfully obvious that there can be no return to this kind of \"business as usual\" with Putins Russia.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the international community has taken a number of appropriate steps to sanction Russia and has provided Ukraine with vital support that has changed the course of the war. Nevertheless, the fact remains that we requested most of these steps prior to the invasion, only to be told that it was impossible. This caution has proven extremely costly.\n\nNor is the danger limited to Russia itself. In recent months, Moscow has sought to form criminal coalitions with other terrorist regimes. Russia and Iran are now testing cheap but deadly drone technologies against Ukrainian civilian targets. It will come as no surprise if these weapons are soon deployed elsewhere. Russian military technologies offered to Iran in exchange for their support in Ukraine pose a further threat to international stability.\n\nBoth Russia and Iran have previously been offered ample opportunities to pursue policies of global integration on very generous terms. Instead, they have consciously chosen confrontation and have sought to weaponize everything from energy and food supplies to migrants and social media. This proves the folly of earlier efforts to appease Vladimir Putin and gives a strong indication of what we can expect if Western leaders do not adopt a more resolute stance. Todays already alarming security situation will only deteriorate if Russia is not decisively defeated in 2023.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nThe world has already paid a terrible price for handing Russia the geopolitical initiative. For Ukraine, this has included tens of thousands of lives and destruction on a scale not witnessed in Europe since World War II. For the wider international community, the economic costs can already be counted in the trillions of dollars. Clearly, it is time to try a different formula.\n\nThe first step toward addressing the current security crisis is regaining the initiative. This means adopting tough preventative measures rather than simply reacting to Russia. It is vital to acknowledge the new security realities created by Russian aggression and reject attempts to resurrect the failed and discredited policies of the past. There can be no way back to the prewar status quo. Most important of all, Western leaders must unambiguously identify Russias defeat as an attainable and desirable goal.\n\nThe coming year will present the West with the perfect opportunity to get it right. We expect to face many of the same security challenges encountered in 2022, including the possibility of major new Russian offensives against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. When Putins invasion began on February 24, the world was initially stunned. This time, there can be no such excuses.\n\nRussia is currently seeking to buy time in order to rearm. It is bombing Ukraines energy infrastructure and creating a humanitarian catastrophe to force Ukraine back to the negotiating table. In parallel, all manner of voices are calling for a return to diplomacy and advocating a Kremlin-friendly compromise peace that would merely set the stage for more war. This is the most immediate challenge facing the international community. Ukraines partners must reject such calls and underline that peace is impossible without Russias defeat.\n\nInstead of seeking face-saving off-ramps for Putin, Western policymakers should now be looking to capitalize on Russias weakness. This means supplying Ukraine with the air defenses, long-range missiles, tanks, and planes we need in order to end the war.\n\nFailure to do so will not prevent escalations, as some critics claim. On the contrary, hesitation on the part of Ukraines international partners only encourages the Kremlin to continue its aggression. Does anybody still seriously believe that not giving Ukraine Western fighter jets will make the world safe from Russias next invasion? Will the absence of adequate air defense systems prevent the Kremlin from acquiring Iranian ballistic missiles? It is time to abandon such illusions.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine proved that it was more than capable of using Western arms supplies to great effect. With Russia now attempting to regroup and preparing a new wave of attacks, it makes no sense to delay weapons deliveries based on misplaced fears of escalation. This will only lead to more casualties and increase the price of Russias eventual defeat. Instead, the West must learn the lessons of the past year and act decisively.\n\nTime and again, Ukraines battlefield successes have confirmed that the only negotiating language Russia recognizes is the language of strength. Ukraine has forced Putins army to retreat from the entire north of the country and has routed Russian troops in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. The sinking of the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship and the destruction of strategic bombers at bases deep inside Russia have proved far more effective at grabbing Russias attention that any diplomatic gestures.\n\nIf Ukraine does not receive the necessary support in 2023, todays mounting security challenges will multiply exponentially around the world. A wide range of authoritarian regimes are closely monitoring developments in Ukraine and will regard any Russian success as a green light for their own acts of aggression. There is also a danger that other regions of the world will prove less able to defend themselves than Ukraine.\n\nThis gloomy scenario is both predictable and entirely avoidable. If the international community provides sufficient military supplies, there is every reason to believe Ukraine will finish the job of defeating Russia in 2023. This would send a resounding message to any dictators and world-be conquerors that force is not a viable foreign policy tool.\n\nA Ukrainian victory would bring with it the prospect of a sustainable peace and the opportunity to build on the countrys vast potential. The consequences would also be felt far beyond Ukraines borders, with the security situation likely to improve dramatically in the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and as far away as Central Asia and Africa. On a global scale, Ukraines success would reinvigorate the entire democratic world while demonstrating the renewed strength of the rules-based international order.\n\nThe world enters 2023 at a crossroads. Russia seeks to dismantle the progress of recent decades and drag us all back to an era of imperial aggression, but the Kremlin must first overcome Ukrainian resistance. If Russia is decisively defeated in Ukraine, the path will be open to a safer and more prosperous planet. Securing this defeat must be the international communitys top priority in 2023.\n\nOleksii Reznikov is Ukraines Minister of Defense.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

We have videos of missiles flying near to a nuclear unit. We had one accident [near] South Ukraine It looks like an accidental fall of missiles, but this fall was around 100 meters from the nuclear unit.\"\n\nGalushchenko said that it was vital the country receive more air defenses going into winter to reduce the risk of a nuclear accident and to maintain electricity and heating supplies for millions of Ukrainians. \"That is critical,\" he said. \"We need more modern systems Countries should do everything and not wait.\"\n\nThe U.S. is reportedly planning to send advanced Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, a development that Russias foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday would lead to unspecified \"consequences.\"\n\nRussia fired more than 70 missiles at Ukraine in Friday's bombardment, Galushchenko said, making it the ninth such \"massive attack\" those comprising between 70 and 100 missiles since Russia began targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure on October 10.\n\nBut since that date, there have been smaller-scale attacks on critical infrastructure on a daily basis, Galuschenko said, with attacks now combining missiles, Iranian-made drones and artillery.\n\n\"That is an experience that no country in the world has faced before. [There is] nobody you can call for advice about what to do in this situation,\" Galushchenko said, adding that engineers were sometimes repairing key infrastructure only for it to be attacked again days later. \"We repair, they hit again, like running in a circle,\" he said.\n\n\"We are grateful to countries that have supplied all kinds of energy equipment to us to help us repair quickly. But if countries can supply [new] air protection systems that will help much more. In that situation they wont be able to hit our generation facilities in the first place.\"\n\nGalushchenko called on allies to send Ukraine more supplies of replacement electricity transformers, which transfer high-voltage electricity sent out by power plants into lower-voltage electricity used on local power grids. He also said that EU countries should extend their sanctions on Russian energy, including through a price cap on imported Russian gas, and sanctions on the Russian atomic sector, including nuclear fuel.\n\n\"I hope that we would maintain the system but that could be useful temporarily whenever we need more time to prepare,\" German Galuschenko, Ukraines energy minister, said | Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty images\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian cities already used to planned blackouts for hours each day could face more prolonged blackouts this winter, Galuschenko said it would depend on the extent of Russian attacks and the weather, but added that the government was prepared for \"worst scenarios,\" with locations designated in cities for people to go for warmth, water and to charge their phones.\n\n\"I hope that we would maintain the system but that could be useful temporarily whenever we need more time to prepare,\" Galuschenko said.\n\n\"[Russia] cannot win on the battlefield so now they start this terror against civilians,\" he added. \"We call it the energy front. It only adds to the unity and more of a wish to win this war.\"",

Reuters was not able to independently verify those reports.\n\nAs the war entered its 11th month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he was open to negotiations, and he blamed Ukraine and its Western allies for failing to engage in talks.\n\nBut his forces kept up their relentless attacks, with the Ukrainian military saying early on Monday dozens of towns in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzia regions had been shelled.\n\n\"In the Kherson direction, the enemy continues artillery shelling of populated areas along the right bank of the Dnipro River,\" the Ukrainian military said.\n\nUkrainian forces launched attacks on almost 20 Russian targets, it added.\n\nUkraines energy grid operator said power was still significantly lacking on Monday, with emergency restrictions for electricity consumption introduced in five Ukrainian regions and the capital Kyiv.\n\nCruise missiles\n\nThe attack on the Engels air base located near the city of Saratov, about 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow and hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines in Ukraine was the second this month.\n\nIt was previously hit on Dec. 5 in what Russia said were Ukrainian drone attacks on two Russian air bases that day.\n\nThe air base is one of two strategic bomber bases housing Russias air-delivered nuclear capability. There was no comment from Kyiv, which has never publicly claimed responsibility for attacks inside Russia.\n\n\"A Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) was shot down at low altitude while approaching the Engels military airfield in the Saratov region,\" the defence ministry statement said.\n\nThree Russian servicemen were killed by falling drone wreckage, it said.\n\nRussia has 60 to 70 strategic bomber planes of two types the Tu-95MS Bear and the Tu-160 Blackjack. Both are capable of carrying nuclear bombs and nuclear-armed cruise missiles as well as conventional munitions.\n\nMoscow has used its air force to fire cruise missiles in attacks that Kyiv has said amount to war crimes.\n\nSaratovs regional governor Roman Busargin said on Monday civilian infrastructure facilities had not been damaged in the latest incident at the base and there was no threat to residents.\n\nPutin said again on Sunday he was open to negotiations a stance Ukraines most powerful backer, the United States, has previously dismissed as posturing given the relentless Russian attacks.\n\n\"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,\" Putin said in an interview on Rossiya 1 state television.\n\nAn adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin needed to acknowledge it was Russia that did not want talks.\n\n\"Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,\" the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. \"Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.\"\n\nRussian attacks on Ukraines power stations have left millions without electricity and Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation that Moscow would aim to make the last days of 2022 dark and difficult.\n\nRussias defence ministry said on Sunday its forces had killed about 60 Ukrainian servicemen the previous day along the Kupiansk-Lyman line of contact and destroyed numerous pieces of Ukrainian military equipment.\n\nReuters could not verify the reports.\n\nThe Kremlin says it will fight until all its territorial aims are achieved, while Kyiv says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from the country.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

The head of the countrys armed forces said Ukrainian forces intercepted 60 of the 76 missiles launched.\n\nRussian strikes on electricity and water systems have occurred intermittently since mid-October, increasing the suffering of the population as winter approaches. But the Ukrainian military has reported increasing success in shooting down incoming rockets and explosive drones.\n\nFridays attack took place after the United States this week agreed to give a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine to further boost the countrys defense. Russias Foreign Ministry warned Thursday that the sophisticated system and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for the Russian military.\n\nREAD MORE:Air defense system thwarts Russian attack on Kyiv, Ukraine says\n\nMore than half of the Russian missiles fired Friday targeted Ukraines capital. The city administration said Kyiv had withstood \"one of the biggest rocket attacks\" it has faced since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly 10 months ago. Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 37 of \"about 40\" that entered the citys airspace, and one person was injured, it said.\n\nUkraines air force said Russian forces had fired cruise missiles from the Admiral Makarov frigate in the Black Sea, while Kh-22 cruise missiles were fired from long-range Tu-22M3 bombers over the Sea of Azov, and tactical aircraft fired guided missiles.\n\nAt the site of one attempted strike in Kyiv, military commanders told The Associated Press that the citys territorial defense mobile group had shot down a cruise missile with a machine gun. It wasnt immediately clear whether other Ukrainian fire may have contributed to downing the rocket.\n\n\"Almost impossible to hit a missile with a machine gun, but it was done,\" said a commander who goes by the call sign \"Hera.\"\n\nAnother commander, a military post chief named \"Yevhen,\" said the machine gunner who intercepted the missile \"reacted quickly\" and fired, and green sparks flew from the rocket as it began to spin and tumble to the ground.\n\nNeither commander would give their real full names, citing security reasons.\n\nElectricity and water services were interrupted in parts of the country, including in the capital and Ukraines second-largest city, Kharkiv. Thousands of people sought shelter in subway stations deep underground during the bombardment.\n\nREAD MORE: Putin ditches annual news conference amid Ukraine setbacks\n\nState-owned grid operator Ukrenergo wrote on Facebook that emergency shutdowns were triggered across the country. Priority in restoring power will be given to critical infrastructure facilities, including hospitals, water supply facilities, heat supply facilities, and sewage treatment plants, it said.\n\nFridays attack was \"the ninth wave of missile strikes on energy facilities,\" Ukrenergo said, and because of the repeated damage, \"the restoration of power supply may take longer than before.\"\n\nAnalysts have said Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure were part of a new strategy to try to freeze Ukrainians into submission after recent battlefield losses by Russian forces. Officials and experts say that has only strengthened the resolve of Ukrainians to face up to Russias invasion, while Moscow tries to buy time for a possible offensive in coming months after the current battlefield stalemate.\n\nIn Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyys hometown, a missile slammed into a four-story residential building and left a gaping hole in its upper floors, with rubble spilling onto the ground. Two people were killed and at least 13 others were taken to the hospital, said Igor Karelin, deputy head of the citys emergency services.\n\nRescue teams with sniffer dogs combed through the debris to search for a missing mother and her 18-month-old child. Karelin said the search was precarious because of the risk that rubble still dangling on the building could fall.\n\nThe southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and its surrounding region were hit by 21 rockets, city council secretary Anatoly Kurtev said. Lights went out in some areas, but there were no initial reports of injuries, he wrote on Telegram.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the city was without electricity. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported three strikes on the citys critical infrastructure. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported explosions in at least four districts and urged residents to go to shelters.\n\nREAD MORE: International allies meet, pledge more aid to get Ukraine through winter\n\n\"The attack on the capital continues,\" he wrote on the social media app. Subway services in the capital were suspended, he said, as city residents flocked inside its tunnels to seek shelter.\n\nUkrzaliznytsia, the national railway operator, said power was out in a number of stations in the eastern and central Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, due to damage to the energy infrastructure. But trains continued to run by switching from electric power to steam-engine power, which had been readied as a backup.\n\nIn neighboring Moldova, the state-owned energy company Moldelectrica reported disruptions to its electricity network as a result of Russias strikes on Ukraine, and warned of a \"high risk\" of power outages.\n\nMoldova whose Soviet-era systems remain interconnected with Ukraines has already suffered two massive blackouts in recent months as Russia attacked Ukraines energy grid.\n\nThe previous such round of massive Russian air strikes across the country took place on Dec. 5. Ukrainian authorities have reported some successes in intercepting and downing incoming missiles, rockets and armed drones in recent weeks, including on Friday.\n\n\"Grateful for the work of Ukraines air defense amid more escalatory Russian attacks this morning on civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and around the country,\" the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, Bridget Brink, wrote on Twitter.",

Sputnik/Sergey Bobylev/Pool via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that U.S. supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's visit to Washington, would not contribute to settling the conflict or prevent Russia from achieving its goals.\n\nIn a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the Patriot shipment: \"This is not conducive to a speedy settlement, quite the contrary.

(Photo: EPA-EFE / Sergey Karpuhin / Sputnik / Kremlin Pool)\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said drones had been used against Kyiv early on Monday, urging the leaders of the UK and other countries to provide more air defence and weapons.\n\nEuropean nations reached a deal to cap natural gas prices at 180 per megawatt hour, ending months of political wrangling over whether to intervene in an energy crisis thats risked pushing the region into a recession.\n\nKey developments\n\nOn the ground\n\nThe city of Kherson, liberated in November, is under permanent fire, including from S-300 missiles, Halyna Luhova, the head of the southern citys military administration, said at a briefing. Ukrainian troops intercepted 18 out of 23 drones launched by Russia overnight at Kyiv, the Ukrinform news agency said, citing the citys military authorities.\n\nEU agrees to cap gas prices at 180\n\nEuropean officials had been seeking an agreement on the cap before the arrival of severe winter weather drives up gas demand for heating and electricity.\n\nThe so-called gas market correction mechanism, designed to prevent extreme price swings, will apply from 15 February. Its significantly lower than an earlier proposal by the European Commission, which wouldnt have prevented the spikes that the region saw this year as Russia curbed gas supplies.\n\nPutin, Lukashenko begin talks in Minsk\n\nPutin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko began talks in Minsk as the Russian leader called the neighbouring nation \"our ally in the truest sense of the word\".\n\nPutin said in televised comments at the start of the meeting in the Belarusian capital that while strengthening economic ties would be the main focus of the discussions, the two sides would also discuss further military-technical cooperation.\n\nRussia attacked Kyiv with Iranian drones, says Zelensky\n\nUkraines capital was attacked early on Monday by drones from a new batch of such weapons that Russia got from Iran, Zelensky said at a meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdoms Joint Expeditionary Force.\n\nRussia constantly uses missiles and drones for strikes, primarily on the Ukrainian energy sector, he said. US intelligence has accused Iran of supplying Russia with drones used to target Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, something the Kremlin denies.\n\nZelensky calls on UK, Nordic states to provide air defence\n\nZelensky called on the leaders of the UK, as well as of the Nordic and Baltic countries, to provide air defence and weapons to fight against Russian missiles.\n\n\"Please maintain the same level of cooperation,\" he said in a video address. \"I call on you to do everything to accelerate the defeat of the occupiers.\"\n\nRussian defence industry intensified production, says official\n\nFactories are working around the clock to meet the Russian militarys demand for tanks and munitions, Vladimir Artyakov, first deputy CEO of the state defence corporation Rostec, said in an interview on Rossiya 24.\n\nProduction of tanks grew significantly and of ammunition \"tens and hundreds of times\", Artaykov said, without providing any data. Russia boosted output of its Iskander short-range missile systems, he said.\n\nRussia has also stepped up production of drones, Artyakov said, adding that the military had too few of them when it started the invasion of Ukraine \"and they were not particularly given importance\".\n\nUkraine sees significant electricity shortages\n\nUkraine has been facing a \"significant\" shortage of electricity since Sunday, as low temperatures have raised pressure on the power grid, which is already under strain from Russian attacks, according to the CEO of its operator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi.\n\nThe country faced another drone attack from Russia early in the morning, following a large-scale missile attack last week that further damaged the nations infrastructure, which affected electricity, heating and water supplies all over the country.\n\nBut Russia failed to destroy the grid and Ukraines power engineers were still able to fix damages relatively quickly, Kudrytskyi said.\n\nUkrainian energy affected by drone hits, says Ukrenergo\n\nThe Ukrainian energy system was in a difficult situation after Russian drones attacked grid infrastructure across the country, the energy company Ukrenergo said on Telegram.\n\nMost problems with power supply were in the countrys central and eastern regions as a result of some drones hitting their targets and Russian shelling near the front line. Despite the damage, the Ukrainian energy system continued to function at a stable frequency and in sync with the European continental grid.\n\nGermanys Rheinmetall expands ammunition output\n\nGerman defence contractor Rheinmetall is expanding ammunition production to ease supply bottlenecks created by the governments support for Ukraine.\n\nThe decision to invest more than 10-million in a new production line in Unterluess near Hamburg is the latest sign that Russias war on Ukraine is reshaping Europes defence industry. The facility is expected to produce ammunition for the 30 Gepard self-propelled, anti-aircraft guns that Germany agreed to supply to Ukraines armed forces.\n\nAustria probes suspected Russian spy\n\nAustrian authorities are investigating the son of a former Russian secret-service official for suspected espionage.\n\nThe intelligence service in Vienna said the 39-year-old Greek citizen met foreign officials several times, passing on information on Austrian foreign and security policy, as well as its potential reaction to Russias war on Ukraine. They seized surveillance equipment and devices used to detect wire-tapping, as well as phones, tablets and laptops, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.\n\nNew strikes further damage Kyivs crucial infrastructure\n\nRussian drone attacks on Monday morning further damaged crucial infrastructure of Ukraines capital Kyiv, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. He said that maintenance workers were trying to stabilise the situation with electricity supplies and heating.\n\nSirens first blared at 2am local time, continuing for hours in a city still confronting power and water shortages, with temperatures below zero.

Meeting a high-level government official in Kyiv earlier this month, my colleagues and I sat, in heavy blankets, in a darkened caf lit by candles. We were discussing how to chronicle ongoing war crimes. And the irony did not escape us that as we spoke of atrocities, Putin was trying to freeze people to death by taking away their sources of heating, water, and light. It would have been comical had it not been so sad.\n\nA piano near the opera house in Kyiv. By Janine di Giovanni.\n\n\"I was never afraid of the Russian missiles. But the cold and loneliness, which comes when all the networks are down, scared me,\" Victoria Amelina told me. A Ukrainian novelist, she lives high up in a 25-floor apartment building, and, because of the power outages, she regularly has to climb the stairwell in the dark, wearing a heavy winter coat.\n\nStill, she admitted, she is luckier than most. When she doesnt feel strong enough to climb, she goes to stay with friends. She is able to get out of Ukraine to visit her mother and small son in Krakow, Poland. She knows others are far worse off than she is. And yet there is no denying that for her and for so many across this brutalized country, life has essentially halted. Their days and nights, their mere existence, is incredibly hard. Amelina remarked that their common plight had crystallized for her when she thought of \"all the parents trying to prepare food for their babies and the elderly in the dark and cold.\" I felt the same when watching mothers push kids in their strollers on the frozen sidewalks, swaddled in blankets.\n\nAmelina, nonetheless, was upbeat. She insisted that Putins attempts to extinguish the lights throughout Ukraine would have the opposite of its intended effect. Instead, she said, it will serve to unify her countrymen and make them even more resilient as the year ends and a new one beckons. \"For the first time since COVID,\" she observed, \"colleagues are coming together as many offices provide electric generators and stable internet access.

                "cc_text": "When Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he was expecting a quick and decisive victory that would cement his place in Russian history and reverse the verdict of 1991 by extinguishing Ukrainian independence once and for all. Instead, the year draws to a close with his army demoralized by successive defeats and Russias reputation as a military superpower in tatters.\n\nIn the first days of the invasion, it soon became clear that things were not going according to plan. Far from greeting Russian troops as liberators, the Ukrainian nation rose up in defiance. Kremlin intelligence forecasts predicting the rapid collapse of the Ukrainian military also proved wildly inaccurate. On the contrary, Ukrainian forces fought back with unexpected skill and ferocity, leading to catastrophic Russian losses.\n\nBy the end of March, Russia had conceded defeat in the Battle of Kyiv and withdrawn entirely from northern Ukraine. Putin responded to this setback by regrouping his decimated forces in eastern Ukraine and concentrating on completing the occupation of the Donbas region. Despite initial success due to Russias overwhelming artillery advantage, this offensive had largely stalled by midsummer with the initiative passing to Ukraine.\n\nThe second half of 2022 was marked by a series of spectacular Ukrainian victories. Russian troops were routed in the Kharkiv region and forced to retreat from the strategically important southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian regional capital to be occupied by Russia. The withdrawal from Kherson was a personal humiliation for Putin. Just weeks earlier, he had hosted a lavish annexation ceremony in the Kremlin and proclaimed that Kherson had joined Russia \"forever.\"\n\nUnable to make progress on the battlefield, Putin changed tack in October and ordered the methodical destruction of Ukraines civilian infrastructure. Waves of airstrikes featuring missiles and kamikaze drones have since plunged Ukraine into darkness while depriving millions of Ukrainians of heating, water, and electricity. This bombing campaign is causing great hardship but does not appear to be undermining Ukraines fighting spirit.\n\nWhile the Russian dictators dreams of an historic victory have failed to materialize, he is not yet ready to admit defeat. In September, Putin announced his countrys first mobilization since World War II, allowing him add a further 300,000 men to his depleted invasion force. Additional waves of mobilization are possible in the coming months. On the home front, the Russian economy is being prepared for the rigors of a long war. Nor is there any sign of significant domestic unrest. Polls indicate that most Russians continue to support the invasion, while those who do not have largely remained silent or chosen exile over protest.\n\nThere is currently no end in sight to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin officials insist Moscow will achieve its objectives, while Western leaders are equally adamant that Russia must not be allowed to succeed. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Ukrainians see the war as a fight for national survival against an openly genocidal enemy. This leaves little room for negotiations or a compromise peace.\n\nWith fighting set to continue into 2023, the Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their observations of the war so far. Why has Putins Ukraine invasion gone so disastrously wrong?\n\nDaniel Fried, Weiser Family Distinguished Fellow, Atlantic Council: What went wrong? Lots of little things but two big things in particular: Russias failure to understand Ukraine and its failure to understand its own system. The Kremlin seems to have believed its own propaganda that the Ukrainian nation does not exist except in subordination to Russia. In this view, a Ukrainian nation that insists it has separate identity and national existence is merely a fascist deformity that must be destroyed by fire and sword. Those familiar with Russian and Soviet imperial thinking can discern the antecedents: Nineteenth century Russian reactionary nationalism and its Soviet counterpart that attempted to identify any Ukrainian patriotism exclusively with its right-wing expression during WWII.\n\nThe Kremlin seems not to grasp how deep Ukrainian patriotism runs and how it has taken shape in a more liberal, multi-ethnic, and pro-democratic form, partly in revulsion against Putinism and its malign values. This spirit of patriotism, personified but not created by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has so far enabled the Ukrainian military to maintain its morale and helped Ukrainian society stand firm in the face of terror and deprivation.\n\nIn contrast, Putins corrupt system fueled by theft and deceit has hollowed out the Russian military and left Russian society generally cynical. Russian state television features bloodthirsty commentators while thousands of Russian young men flee the country to avoid military service. The sacrifices Ukrainians are willing to make as they fight for their lives and their country seem foreign to Putins Russia. Like the Czarist regime in the early twentieth century, Putin seems to have believed a \"short victorious war\" was just the tonic his system needed. But Russias failure in the 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War merely exposed the rot at the heart of the empire.\n\nTyrannies often turn out to be weaker than the image put forth by their strutting leaders. Democracies often turn out to be resilient in ways that can astonish those who look no further than their messy politics or peacetime pettiness. So it seems with Russia and Ukraine, with the battle still in the balance.\n\nSuriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: With Russian atrocities continuing, it is still far too soon to declare that Putin has failed in his effort to make Ukraine sorry for not wanting to be Russian. At the same time, its certainly clear that he is not winning. This failure to win is rooted in Putins own lack of understanding that Ukrainians are not Russians. Obviously, this is most immediately evident in Ukraines willingness to fight in order to avoid being forcibly subsumed into Russia.\n\nOn a deeper level, Ukrainians have demonstrated emphatically that they differ from their Russian neighbors in terms of the national character they have displayed during the past ten months of war. The innovation, work ethic, and commitment to country over self shown by Ukrainians are all qualities that, if they previously existed in Russia, Putin himself has worked hard to erode.\n\nSince February, Putin has found Ukraine a very a different opponent compared to the country he expected to face. Ukraines aptitude for teamwork and ability to rapidly change tactics are factors that he simply has no answer for. And it is these same Ukrainian qualities that will ensure the country eventually rebuilds and rebounds.\n\nSteve Pifer, William J. Perry Fellow, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University: Several reasons help explain why Russias invasion of Ukraine has gone so badly. First, the Kremlin and Russian General Staff greatly underestimated their foe and did not expect the Ukrainians to resist with such tenacity, skill, and courage. It is astonishing that they so badly misunderstood their neighbor. It was clear to Western observers that Ukrainians would fiercely resist, as they see this as an existential fight.\n\nSecond, the Russian military has not mastered certain complex tactics such as combined arms operations and suppression of enemy air defenses. For example, armored columns entered urban areas unsupported by dismounted infantry, while Russian air power stays largely over Russian-controlled territory for fear of being shot down by Ukrainian air defense. This adds to other problems endemic in Russias military such as poor leadership, poor morale, and poor logistics.\n\nThird, the Kremlin has discovered that the defense sector is not immune from the corruption that pervades Russian society. Moscow is not getting the results it expected from the hundreds of billions of US dollars spent on modernizing the Russian military over the past 15 years. For example, the Russian military received precision-guided weapons that often miss targets or otherwise fail, while some tanks have explosive reactive armor plates filled with rubber rather than explosives.\n\nFourth, Though not moving as rapidly as they could and should, Western arms deliveries have given the Ukrainian army additional military tools to sustain its fight.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nKristina Hook, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University: Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine will be studied as one of the eras biggest political, military, economic, and moral failures. Years of corruption and bad governance weakened Russias military and institutional capabilities. The personal nature of Putins authoritarianism encouraged pilfering over policy planning and selective law enforcement over meritocracy, while creating neo-imperial blind spots that prevented key members of the Putin regime from understanding the historic nature of the changes taking place in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nMany Russians simply underestimated the talent and tenacity of Ukrainians, who used the last eight years of armed conflict in the east of the country to carry out crucial military reforms and develop civil society. Ugly stereotypes about Ukraine continue to undermine Russias ability to accept and learn from their military defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army.\n\nWhile credit for stalling Russias war machine belongs primarily to Ukraines defenders, citizens, and state, Putin also badly underestimated the Wests commitment to a rules-based global order. Despite Russian nuclear saber-rattling and erroneous assumptions of the democratic worlds readiness to abandon Ukraine, West military aid has continued to expand and diversify.\n\nLooking ahead, the genocidal nature of Russias war implies that we must prepare for Putin to double down on his failures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recently painted a sobering but realistic view of the military support still needed in order to protect civilians and prevent Russia from achieving its goals. Now is the time to continue demonstrating how ill-advised Putins miscalculations are.\n\nJames Sherr, Senior Fellow, International Centre for Defence and Security, Tallinn: In Russia, the absolute imperative of absolute victory is never deflected by anything so trivial as error. Between February and May, those who believed that the Russian military system had insulated itself from the venality, mendacity, and servility of the Putin system found themselves pleasantly or rudely surprised. But we see once again that just as Putin is on the point of losing one game, he starts another. The withdrawal of strike groupings from Kyiv was the prelude to the Donbas offensive, then to mobilization and reinforcement, and now to the crippling of Ukraines energy infrastructure, which has become indistinguishable from the wholesale destruction of the country. The latter enterprises are abetted by the appointment of the mercilessly competent Russian General Sergei Surovikin and Irans de facto entry into the war.\n\nIt is time we understood that as long as Putin remains in power, the war will continue. If, as is now possible, Russia forces a halt to Ukraines offensive momentum, this need not be long in duration nor disadvantageous to Ukraine. Russias military commanders are capable of learning lessons and are learning them; but the military system has limited capacity to absorb these lessons. In contrast, Ukraines capacity for adaptation, innovation, and renewal are unmatched and indestructible. Ukraines Western partners must draw a lesson of their own. Time favors Ukraine. But it must be used to deny Russia the sanctuaries it requires to shape the parameters and rules of this conflict.\n\nDiane Francis, Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: Putins invasion has failed so far because of several miscalculations. Crucially, he believed his own propaganda about Russias unassailable military might. He was also convinced that Ukraine was not a nation but a mere province of Russia. He believed NATO would remain ineffective. And he never dreamed that US President Joe Biden would help unite Europe and launch massive sanctions along with an unprecedented program to arm and support Ukraines defense.\n\nPutins first military mistake was to launch an unprovoked invasion with just 150,000 troops compared to the 600,000 soldiers sent in 1968 to crush anti-Soviet protests in Czechoslovakia, a country one-fifth the size of Ukraine. He also misunderstood the cultural shift in Ukraine toward the West and underestimated the leadership and communication skills of Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has harnessed the intelligence, resilience, patriotism, and unity of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nTen months into Russias invasion, Ukraine has gained the initiative thanks to a combination of battlefield courage and strategic skill along with massive Western help and favorable world opinion. Putin cannot reverse this. He has threatened a possible escalation to nuclear weapons but would do so at the peril of his nation. As he murders more civilians, bombs more infrastructure, and plunges Ukrainians into freezing darkness this winter, Putin is a reviled figure and is increasingly seen as a failure. Meanwhile, Ukraine is honored and celebrated across the globe.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, Ukrainian MP, Holos Party: The main reason Putin is failing is because he was too late. If he had struck in 2014 when the Ukrainian state was weak, the army was almost non-existent, institutions were unstable, and the opposition had much less influence on national affairs, his chances for success would have been much higher. However, Russia did not seize this opportunity and Ukraine was able to strengthen. The countrys strategic course toward the EU and NATO was enshrined in the Ukrainian Constitution, while the Ukrainian army underwent vital reforms that resulted in significantly increased quality.\n\nThe second reason behind Putins difficulties is the fact that the Russians did not expect to encounter broad civilian resistance in Ukraine. This reflects deeply entrenched Russian misconceptions about the nature of Ukrainian society, and is also due to the Kremlins massive financial investment prior to the invasion to weaken and corrupt Ukraine from within. However, all regions of Ukraine united to resist Russias invasion.\n\nA third key factor was the initial military assistance provided by partners such as the US, UK, Poland, and the Baltic states in the months immediately preceding the Russian invasion. These weapons deliveries helped Ukraine to keep fighting during the critical first weeks of the war and convinced the democratic world to begin sending more advanced and diverse arms supplies to the country.\n\nAlexander Motyl, Professor, Rutgers University: The Russian invasion has gone badly for several reasons. The Russians came awfully close to capturing Kyiv during the first weeks of the invasion but the Ukrainians fought hard and managed to stave off the immediate assault. Once that happened and the shock of the attack began to wear off, the Ukrainians rallied, while the Russians reverted to business as usual. That meant poor leadership, poor logistics, poor tactics, and poor strategy. These are all products of a modern Russian military system that squanders resources, ignores modernization, and promotes corruption.\n\nAbove all, the Russian performance has been undermined by Vladimir Putins constant interference in military affairs. Inevitably, his inexperience and arrogance have resulted in a series of poor decisions. The internal rot within the Russian armed forces thereby came to the fore and has been amply demonstrated throughout the war.\n\nWestern support has also been crucial. Once a Russian victory no longer seemed inevitable, once the Ukrainians proved they would fight and could survive, and once the Ukrainian military demonstrated that it knew how to fight effectively, the West overcame its initial skepticism and began to supply Ukraine with significant amounts of weapons and other resources.\n\nUltimately, of course, the underlying cause of Putins failing invasion is Russias chronic underestimation of Ukraine and Ukrainians. This is a cultural predisposition that manifests itself in the view that Ukrainians are incompetent and inferior, and are thus incapable of any kind of successful military campaign.\n\nMiriam Kosmehl, Senior Expert Eastern Europe and EU Neighborhood, Bertelsmann Stiftung: Vladimir Putin simply did not understand the strength of Ukrainian national identity or the durability of the state the Ukrainians had built. Due to his own fear of domestic uprisings against his rule, Putin has created a strong personal power vertical but not a strong Russian state. He made the mistake of assuming Ukraine was the same.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Putin badly underestimated Ukraine. When preparing to invade, he failed to recognize Ukraines deep-rooted commitment to the countrys independence and democratic future. Russia observed President Zelenskyys falling approval ratings along with the constant flow of criticism from Ukrainian civil society and drew the false conclusion that most Ukrainians would welcome change. This was a fundamental misreading of the situation.\n\nFor years prior to the invasion, the Russian security services had been preparing the ground by penetrating Ukrainian local government structures and recruiting Ukrainian officials to switch sides at the decisive moment and aid a Russian takeover. However, with the survival of the Ukrainian nation at stake, the vast majority of Ukrainians fought back. Russia completely misjudged this readiness of individual Ukrainians to fight for their country. When the full-scale Russian invasion began, huge numbers of Ukrainians flocked to join the army or territorial defense forces. Similarly, Moscow expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be a weak wartime leader. In hindsight, this may have been the biggest miscalculation of all!\n\nPutins disastrous failure to understand the realities of todays Ukraine was accompanied by similarly unrealistic expectations regarding the Wests likely response to a Russian invasion. Based on the muted Western reaction to earlier Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Putin believed he could count on a similarly underwhelming response. Instead, the West imposed tough sanctions and began unprecedented arms shipments to Ukraine.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

                "cc_text": "That answer likely hinges in large part on what new weapons the U.S. and its European allies sign off on sending to Kyiv in the coming months, current and former officials say.\n\n\"What I think the U.S. and others are wrestling with now is: What does a successful endgame look like?\" said one Western official, who like others interviewed requested anonymity to discuss strategy discussions. \"When youre looking at expanding, whether in terms of capability or literally expanding the battlefield in that way, there will be some questions raised about does this make that day further off when we can get a kind of favorable conditions for the kind of settlement the Ukrainians want and we can support?\"\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe, said miscalibrating could have disastrous consequences.\n\n\"The administration is going to use their best judgment on, how do you help Ukraine as much as possible without this growing into a conflict between the U.S. and Russia or NATO and Russia?\" he said.\n\nUkraines leaders are arguing that longer-range missiles and modern battle tanks the very weapons considered off-limits by many nations are the only way to dislodge entrenched Russian positions and bring the conflict to an end. U.S. officials are still debating their effectiveness in the forthcoming fight and whether shipping them to Kyiv will provoke Russia into escalating the conflict to more dangerous levels that could prolong the timeline for potential peace talks.\n\nThose talks dont appear any closer, despite Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebas suggestion this week that Kyiv is open to U.N.-brokered discussions by February, but only after Russia faces a war crimes tribunal. Thats a demand unlikely to be accepted by the Kremlin.\n\nIn the meantime, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys top priority remains more guns, ammunition and equipment. The leader reupped his pleas for more sophisticated weapons during his surprise visit to Washington last week. While President Joe Biden has remained unmoved by some of the requests for tanks, fighter planes and missiles, the visit did see some big announcements of expanded military support. Washington will soon be sending a Patriot air defense battery and new precision bombs, both of which were seen as almost impossible or impractical just weeks ago.\n\nThe massive influx of arms to Ukraine over the past 10 months marks a significant shift from Washingtons previous approach to Kyiv. Even after Putins 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Obama administration refused to provide offensive arms to Ukraine, instead opting to provide training programs and uncontroversial equipment such as night vision goggles. It wasnt until the Trump administration that the Pentagon approved sending Javelin antitank weapons and even then stipulated that the Javelins must be stored in the western part of the country, away from the front lines.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons, Washingtons red lines have shifted again and again since the February invasion. In the space of a week in March, the U.S. and NATO pushed more than 17,000 Javelins into the country, a flood of weapons that shattered a political firewall that held across the Obama and Trump administrations. In the spring, the Biden administration began providing 155-millimeter howitzers. Then in June, the Pentagon announced that it would send the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, a modern rocket launcher that Kyiv has used to lethal effect, and which took months of wrangling to convince the Biden administration to send.\n\nThe announcement that the U.S. will soon transfer a Patriot battery and aerial smart bombs, the latest of many weapons packages once considered escalatory earlier in the war, hints at further potential policy changes next year as all sides look for a way to end the fighting.\n\nZelenskyy has been clear what kind of settlement he wants. The Ukrainian president and his top advisers have outlined a maximalist vision: the complete retaking of all land occupied by Russian forces since Putins 2014 invasion and annexation of Crimea.\n\nDuring last weeks joint press conference with Biden at the White House, Zelenskyy described a just peace as \"no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country.\" Biden was quick to align himself with that idea, saying, \"I think we share the exact same vision.\"\n\nThat runs up against Putins view, in which he has said there wont be any peace talks with Ukraine if it means Russia would have to concede territory they had illegally annexed since 2014.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for the reality President Putin and the top leadership in the Kremlin show zero signs of diminishing their original war aims based on realities on the ground for now,\" said Michael Carpenter, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nFor now, the Ukrainian forces are focused on continuing to try and advance on the battlefield this winter even as the colder weather sets in.\n\n\"The victory in the war, I think it needs to be a stable, sustainable kind of situation,\" said Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraines National Security and Defence Council. \"Any peace talks and freezing in fighting is not the end of the war. The population will not accept it ... I think the expectation is to restore all of our territories.\"\n\nIf Ukraine continues to insist that only retaking Crimea will end the war, the fighting could continue for years, as long as both sides can find the equipment, and will, to wage war.\n\nBoth sides are currently dug in on opposite sides of the Dnipro River, after Russia withdrew its forces from the southern city of Kherson this fall. In order to advance, Ukrainian troops must cross the river and take and hold territory on the other side, in what amounts to a difficult amphibious assault much like the Normandy landing in World War II, said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe.\n\nBut neither side is expected to be able to mount a major ground counteroffensive in the near future, as muddy weather conditions limit movement until the ground freezes completely in February.\n\nUntil then, Ukraine and Russia continue to wage smaller battles across the front lines in the south and east, with trench lines taking a pummeling from artillery and small drone strikes, and small patches of land changing hands on a daily basis.\n\nAnd while the HIMARS has proven itself deadly accurate in targeting Russian positions, Putins forces have adjusted to that threat. The Russians have moved their command and control nodes and weapons depots out of the 80-mile range of HIMARS batteries to points further south in Crimea, said one person familiar with Ukrainian battlefield assessments. Those movements have blunted some of the weapons effectiveness, and increased calls for the longer-range ATACMS missiles, which can travel 190 miles before precisely striking a target.\n\nU.S. Airman and Soldiers flew, unloaded the HIMARS during the Emergency Deployment Readiness Exercise at Kunsan Air Base in Dacheon, South Korea, Sept. 20, 2017. | Eighth Army Public Affairs via Getty Images\n\n\"The HIMARS, that was a game changer,\" Danylyuk said. \"Right up until Russia managed to learn how to adapt to it. Now, we kind of reached the limit of what we can do with these advanced weapons. For the next stage, we need the longer-range weapons to achieve the goals that we achieved four months ago when we first received the HIMARS. We can do the same but the range should be longer.\"\n\nHodges, the former U.S. Army Europe commander, argued that ATACMS missiles are \"exactly what they need\" right now. The longer-range weapons would allow Ukraine to hammer key Russian positions such as the Kerch bridge, Russian air bases on Crimea and communications lines.\n\nZelenskyy brought the weapon up during his talks with Biden, but the U.S. hasnt budged in its refusal to send them, the person said.\n\nWhile those longer-range missiles remain atop Ukraines wish list, other weapons could help Kyiv continue its offensives around Bakhmut and in the south. Military leaders have said for months that U.S. Abrams tanks and German Leopard tanks would tip the scales in some of the closer-range ground fighting they expect to see over the winter.\n\nUkrainian officials have asked the Biden administration to send just a handful of Abrams tanks as few as three or four to break German resistance to sending their own Leopards, according to one person familiar with the discussions. German officials have said publicly they wont be the first country to send their own tanks to the fight, so the pitch by Kyiv is that even a small number of Abrams tanks would remove that obstacle.\n\nPoland has donated 250 older Russian-made T-72 tanks, and the U.S. is paying for Czechia to upgrade another 45 T-72s for Ukraine, but no Western-made tanks have yet been delivered. While U.S. defense and military officials say tanks are not off the table, some argue that the training and logistics challenges associated with giving these weapons to Kyiv would prove counterproductive.\n\nKyiv is also calling for cluster munitions, which Russia has been using to deadly effect on the battlefield. But these weapons officially called dual-purposed improvised conventional munitions are banned by more than 100 countries, and there is no appetite in the Biden administration to send them. Instead, the U.S. and other countries continue to send tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and mortars every few weeks as part of each new aid package.\n\nAnd experts argued that more sophisticated weapons such as the Patriot system and ATACMS are not as important to the coming fight as effective training, logistics and tactics. Patriot, for example, is a long-range, high-altitude missile system used against intercontinental ballistic missiles and high-flying jets. One Patriot will not be enough to defend Ukraines entire 500-kilometer front, Hertling said, stressing that it must be used in combination with mid-range and low-altitude air defenses.\n\n\"Patriots are not going to do the kinds of things people think they are going to do right now,\" he said. \"It is not a be all, end all in terms of providing the air defense Ukraine needs.\"\n\nA new training program the Pentagon recently announced, which will teach Ukrainian soldiers new tactics for maneuvering infantry with supporting artillery, will be key to a successful river crossing, Hertling argued.\n\n\"I wont say that will be unopposed, but it will be difficult for the Russians to oppose that kind of movement,\" he said.\n\nAnd the Biden White House has flatly refused to ATACMS because it views the weapon as too escalatory.\n\n\"The idea that we would give Ukraine material that is fundamentally different than is already going, there would have a prospect of breaking up NATO and breaking up the European Union and the rest of the world,\" Biden said during the press conference with Zelenskyy. \"Theyre not looking to go to war with Russia. Theyre not looking for a third World War.\"\n\n\"Ukraine will defend itself at any cost,\" Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraines National Security and Defense Council said in an interview. \"It will use the weapons that we have and even if we dont have the weapons [that we need], we will fight with our teeth to get Russia out of our lands.\"\n\nOriana Pawlyk contributed to this report.",

Air raid sirens rang out across the country.\n\nRussia dispatched explosive drones to selected regions overnight before broadening the barrage with \"air and sea-based cruise missiles launched from strategic aircraft and ships\" in the morning, the Ukrainian air force reported. It called the attack \"massive,\" according to French news agency AFP.\n\nThe widespread attack was the latest in a series of Russian strikes targeting vital infrastructure across Ukraine. Moscow has launched such attacks on a weekly basis since October as its ground forces got bogged down and even lost ground.\n\nAfter earlier attacks, the Ukrainian military reported shooting down incoming Russian missiles and explosive drones, but some still reached their targets, damaging power and water supplies and increasing the suffering of the population amid freezing temperatures.\n\nIn a new development that could rised escalating tension in the region, a social media channel linked to Belarus' presidential press service said a Ukrainian S-300 air defense missile had landed on Belarusian soil early Thursday. It said the missile may have landed in Belarus accidentally and there were no casualties, but the Belarusian Defense Ministry said later that it had been shot down by Belarusian air defenses over the western Brest region.\n\nBelarus is a close ally of Russia's, and sitting just north of Ukraine, it was used as a staging ground for Vladimir Putin's February 24 invasion. Fears have simmered for months that Belarus could look for a pretext to join the Russian aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe governor of Russia's Saratov region, meanwhile, said Russian air defense systems had shot down an \"unidentified object\" near the city of Engels, which hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border inside Russian territory. Engles is also home to an air base that serves as the primary hub for Russia's nuclear-capable strategic bombers, which have been used to drop conventional bombs on Ukraine.\n\nRussia's military has already said the Engels air base was targeted Ukraine, using drones, twice this month, but while noting them, Ukraine has never overtly acknowledged an attack within Russian territory.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States agreed to give a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine to boost the country's defense. The U.S. and other allies also pledged to provide energy-related equipment to help Ukraine withstand the attacks on its infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian air defense system intercepts a rocket launched by Russian forces at Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 29, 2022. Mustafa Ciftci / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAFP quoted Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny as saying, \"According to preliminary data, 69 missiles were launched in total. Fifty0four enemy cruise missiles were shot down.\"\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had said earlier in the day that Russia had launched over 120 missiles.\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv said all 16 missiles that targeted the capital were downed, AFP reported, adding that 40% of Kyiv had no power.\n\nAt least three people were wounded and hospitalized, including a 14-year- old girl, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. He asked people to stockpile water and charge their electronic devices.\n\nFragments from downed Russian missiles damaged two private buildings in the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv, the city administration said. An industrial facility and a playground in neighborhoods located across the Dnieper River also were damaged, city officials said. No casualties were immediately reported.\n\nRescuers work at a site of private houses heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine on Dec. 29, 2022. UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE via Reuters\n\nNumerous explosions also took place in Kharkiv, which is in eastern Ukraine and the country's second-largest city, and in the city of Lviv near the border with Poland, according to their mayors.\n\nAbout 90% of Lviv was without electricity, Mayor Andriy Sadovyi wrote on Telegram. Trams and trolley buses weren't working, and residents might experience water interruptions, he said. Attacks on that city have been relatively rare.\n\nAs the latest wave of Russian strikes began Thursday, authorities in the Dnipro, Odesa and Kryvyi Rih regions said they switched off electricity to minimize the damage to critical infrastructure facilities if they were hit.\n\nThe governor of southern Ukraine's Mykolaiv province, Vitaliy Kim, said five missiles were shot down over the Black Sea. The Ukrainian military's command North said two were downed over the Sumy region, located on the border with Russia in the country's northeast.\n\nIn the south, Odesa Governor Maksym Marchenko said 21 missiles were intercepted over the region, AFP reported.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States agreed to give a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine to boost the country's defense. The U.S. and other allies also pledged to provide energy-related equipment to help Ukraine withstand the attacks on its infrastructure.\n\nPodolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Russia was aiming to \"destroy critical infrastructure and kill civilians en masse.\"\n\n\"We're waiting for further proposals from 'peacekeepers' about 'peaceful settlement,' 'security guarantees for RF' and undesirability of provocations,\" Podolyak tweeted, a sarcastic reference to statements from some in the West who urged Ukraine to seek a political settlement of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday that his nation wants a \"peace\" summit within two months at the United Nations with Secretary-General Antnio Guterres as mediator. Kuleba said Russia must face a war-crimes tribunal before his country directly talks with Moscow. He said, however, that other nations should feel free to engage with the Russians.\n\nCommenting on the summit proposal Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed it as \"delirious\" and \"hollow,\" describing the proposal as a \"publicity stunt by Washington that tries to cast the Kyiv regime as a peacemaker.\"\n\n\"It's an attempt to give a semblance of legitimacy to a meaningless discussion that will not be followed by any concrete steps,\" Zakharova said during a briefing.\n\nRussian officials have said that any peace plan can only proceed from Kyiv's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it illegally annexed from Ukraine in September.",

Putins War A Times investigation based on interviews, intercepts, documents and secret battle plans shows how a \"walk in the park\" became a catastrophe for Russia. They never had a chance. Fumbling blindly through cratered farms, the troops from Russias 155th Naval Infantry Brigade had no maps, medical kits or working walkie-talkies, they said. Just a few weeks earlier, they had been factory workers and truck drivers, watching an endless showcase of supposed Russian military victories at home on state television before being drafted in September. One medic was a former barista who had never had any medical training. Now, they were piled onto the tops of overcrowded armored vehicles, lumbering through fallow autumn fields with Kalashnikov rifles from half a century ago and virtually nothing to eat, they said. Russia had been at war most of the year, yet its army seemed less prepared than ever. In interviews, members of the brigade said some of them had barely fired a gun before and described having almost no bullets anyway, let alone air cover or artillery. But it didnt frighten them too much, they said. They would never see combat, their commanders had promised. Only when the shells began crashing around them, ripping their comrades to pieces, did they realize how badly they had been duped. Flung to the ground, a drafted Russian soldier named Mikhail recalled opening his eyes to a shock: the shredded bodies of his comrades littering the field. Shrapnel had sliced open his belly, too. Desperate to escape, he said, he crawled to a thicket of trees and tried to dig a ditch with his hands. Of the 60 members of his platoon near the eastern Ukrainian town of Pavlivka that day in late October, about 40 were killed, said Mikhail, speaking by phone from a military hospital outside Moscow. Only eight, he said, escaped serious injury. \"This isnt war,\" Mikhail said, struggling to speak through heavy, liquid breaths. \"Its the destruction of the Russian people by their own commanders.\" 1.

Putins war was never supposed to be like this. When the head of the C.I.A. traveled to Moscow last year to warn against invading Ukraine, he found a supremely confident Kremlin, with Mr. Putins national security adviser boasting that Russias cutting-edge armed forces were strong enough to stand up even to the Americans. Russian invasion plans, obtained by The New York Times, show that the military expected to sprint hundreds of miles across Ukraine and triumph within days. Officers were told to pack their dress uniforms and medals in anticipation of military parades in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But instead of that resounding victory, with tens of thousands of his troops killed and parts of his army in shambles after nearly 10 months of war, Mr. Putin faces something else entirely: his nations greatest human and strategic calamity since the collapse of the Soviet Union. A dead Russian soldier in Kharkiv the day after the war started in February. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times How could one of the worlds most powerful militaries, led by a celebrated tactician like Mr. Putin, have faltered so badly against its much smaller, weaker rival? To piece together the answer, we drew from hundreds of Russian government emails, documents, invasion plans, military ledgers and propaganda directives. We listened to Russian phone calls from the battlefield and spoke with dozens of soldiers, senior officials and Putin confidants who have known him for decades. A Russian logbook detailing the movement of airborne troops from Belarus toward Kyiv, including attacks and \"nonstop fire\" by Ukrainian forces. Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. The Times investigation found a stunning cascade of mistakes that started with Mr. Putin profoundly isolated in the pandemic, obsessed with his legacy, convinced of his own brilliance and continued long after drafted soldiers like Mikhail were sent to the slaughter. At every turn, the failures ran deeper than previously known: In interviews, Putin associates said he spiraled into self-aggrandizement and anti-Western zeal, leading him to make the fateful decision to invade Ukraine in near total isolation, without consulting experts who saw the war as pure folly. Aides and hangers-on fueled his many grudges and suspicions, a feedback loop that one former confidant likened to the radicalizing effect of a social-media algorithm. Even some of the presidents closest advisers were left in the dark until the tanks began to move. As another longtime confidant put it, \"Putin decided that his own thinking would be enough.\" The Russian military, despite Western assumptions about its prowess, was severely compromised, gutted by years of theft. Hundreds of billions of dollars had been devoted to modernizing the armed forces under Mr. Putin, but corruption scandals ensnared thousands of officers. One military contractor described frantically hanging enormous patriotic banners to hide the decrepit conditions at a major Russian tank base, hoping to fool a delegation of top brass. The visitors were even prevented from going inside to use the bathroom, he said, lest they discover the ruse. Once the invasion began, Russia squandered its dominance over Ukraine through a parade of blunders. It relied on old maps and bad intelligence to fire its missiles, leaving Ukrainian air defenses surprisingly intact, ready to defend the country. Russias vaunted hacking squads tried, and failed, to win in what some officials call the first big test of cyberweapons in actual warfare. Russian soldiers, many shocked they were going to war, used their cellphones to call home, allowing the Ukrainians to track them and pick them off in large numbers. And Russias armed forces were so stodgy and sclerotic that they did not adapt, even after enduring huge losses on the battlefield. While their planes were being shot down, many Russian pilots flew as if they faced no danger, almost like they were at an air show. Stretched thin by its grand ambitions, Russia seized more territory than it could defend, leaving thousands of square miles in the hands of skeleton crews of underfed, undertrained and poorly equipped fighters. Many were conscripts or ragtag separatists from Ukraines divided east, with gear from the 1940s or little more than printouts from the internet describing how to use a sniper rifle, suggesting soldiers learned how to fight on the fly. With new weapons from the West in hand, the Ukrainians beat them back, yet Russian commanders kept sending waves of ground troops into pointless assaults, again and again. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" one Russian soldier said he realized after being ordered into a fifth march directly in the sights of Ukrainian artillery. Finally, he and his demoralized comrades refused to go. A Soviet-era map of modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia recovered from the battlefield. Mr. Putin divided his war into fiefs, leaving no one powerful enough to challenge him. Many of his fighters are commanded by people who are not even part of the military, like his former bodyguard, the leader of Chechnya and a mercenary boss who has provided catering for Kremlin events. As the initial invasion failed, the atomized approach only deepened, chipping away at an already disjointed war effort. Now, Mr. Putins fractured armies often function like rivals, competing for weapons and, at times, viciously turning on one another. One soldier recounted how the clashes became violent, with a Russian tank commander deliberately charging at his supposed allies and blowing up their checkpoint. Since the early days of the invasion, Mr. Putin has conceded, privately, that the war has not gone as planned. During a meeting in March with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, Mr. Putin admitted that the Ukrainians were tougher \"than I was told,\" according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"This will probably be much more difficult than we thought. But the war is on their territory, not ours. We are a big country and we have patience.\" People who know Mr. Putin say he is ready to sacrifice untold lives and treasure for as long as it takes, and in a rare face-to-face meeting with the Americans last month the Russians wanted to deliver a stark message to President Biden: No matter how many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded on the battlefield, Russia will not give up. One NATO member is warning allies that Mr. Putin is ready to accept the deaths or injuries of as many as 300,000 Russian troops roughly three times his estimated losses so far. Just days after facing blowback about the war from normally friendly leaders in September, Mr. Putin doubled down on the invasion, calling up hundreds of thousands of Russians in a draft that was supposed to turn the war in Russias favor, but has instead stirred growing anger at home. Soon after, hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed outside Pavlivka, including Mikhails drafted comrades in the blind advance of the 155th. \"Legs, guts. I mean, meat. Just meat,\" another member of the platoon, Aleksandr, said from a hospital in Russia. \"I know it sounds terrible, but you cant describe it any other way. People were turned into hamburger.\" Aleksandr recounted how he and his fellow draftees had asked their instructor in Russia what they could possibly learn about firing a gun and becoming soldiers in the few weeks before being sent to Ukraine. \"He was honest: Nothing,\" Aleksandr said the instructor responded.

Maps by Scott Reinhard. The more setbacks Mr. Putin endures on the battlefield, the more fears grow over how far he is willing to go. He has killed tens of thousands in Ukraine, leveled cities and targeted civilians for maximum pain obliterating hospitals, schools and apartment buildings, while cutting off power and water to millions before winter. Each time Ukrainian forces score a major blow against Russia, the bombing of their country intensifies. And Mr. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world that he can use anything at his disposal, including nuclear arms, to pursue his notion of victory. Emergency services at the site of a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia, in October. Nicole Tung for The New York Times As far back as January, with the United States warning that Russias invasion of Ukraine was imminent, a retired Russian general named Leonid Ivashov saw disaster on the horizon. In a rare open letter, he warned that using force against Ukraine would threaten \"the very existence of Russia as a state.\" In a recent phone interview, General Ivashov said that his warnings before the war echoed what he had been hearing from nervous Russian military officials at the time. Though the Kremlin insisted an invasion was not on the table, some could tell otherwise. Service members told him that \"victory in such a situation is impossible,\" he said, but their superiors told them not to worry. A war would be a \"walk in the park,\" they were told. The last 10 months, he went on, have turned out to be \"even more tragic\" than predicted. Nimble Ukrainian generals and soldiers have outmaneuvered a much bigger, more lethal foe. The West, cheered by Ukraines successes, has provided ever more powerful weapons to drive the Russians back. \"Never in its history has Russia made such stupid decisions,\" General Ivashov said. \"Alas, today stupidity has triumphed stupidity, greed, a kind of vengefulness and even a kind of malice.\" Mr. Putins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, blames the West, and the weapons it has given Ukraine, for Russias unexpected difficulties in the war. \"This is a big burden for us,\" Mr. Peskov said, depicting Russia as taking on all of NATOs military might in Ukraine. \"It was just very hard to believe in such cynicism and in such bloodthirstiness on the part of the collective West.\" Some of the wars original supporters are starting to reckon with the idea of defeat. Before the invasion, American intelligence agencies identified Oleg Tsaryov as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install once it took over Ukraine. His faith in the war has since slipped away.

The attack came by land, sea and air. The attack came by land, sea and air. As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. Oleksii bolted across the tarmac in the dark as the first Russian missiles landed, clambered into his Su-27 fighter jet and took off just as buildings across the airfield began to explode. \"At that moment, I understood that it was really something bad,\" said Oleksii, 26, on condition that only his first name and rank, captain, be used. Some other soldiers and officials in this article were not authorized to speak publicly, or faced reprisals. Just before 6 a.m. Moscow time, Mr. Putin declared the opening of his \"special military operation\" in a televised address. It began with an aerial bombardment to take out Ukraines air defenses, communications and radar installations to overwhelm its military and shatter its ability to fight back. More than 150 missiles thundered into Ukraine from bombers, submarines and ships. As many as 75 Russian aircraft streaked into Ukrainian skies, about the size of Ukraines entire working air combat fleet, analysts and officials said. On his radar screen, Oleksii saw the blips of incoming missiles and enemy aircraft before getting his orders: Fly to a backup air base in central Ukraine. When he landed, he was astonished. Not only was his unit there, but a good portion of Ukraines remaining air force as well. For days, he and his fellow pilots flew missions from their new base, wondering when Russian radar operators would finally notice them. A strike on their position could have been disastrous, gutting the Ukrainian defense, and the pilots assumed it was only a matter of time until one came. But it took four days for the Russians to attack, and most of the aircraft had moved to new locations by then, leaving Oleksii in amazement. \"It was really simple,\" he said. \"I dont know how they missed this opportunity.\" The failure to destroy Ukraines modest air defenses was one of the most significant blunders of the war, foiling Russias mighty air force early on. Interviews revealed why that happened and how the Ukrainians managed to stay a step ahead of their invaders. Russia invades Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Ukraine should have been overwhelmed. By one count, its fighter jets were outnumbered 15 to one in some early air battles. Russias planes were also more advanced, helping its pilots see farther and strike from greater distances. Russia had thousands of cruise and ballistic missiles that should have smothered Ukraines aging, Soviet-era defenses. That is what American and Ukrainian intelligence officials assumed, anyway, leading to predictions that Ukraine would fall within days. So, Ukraine shuffled the deck. It moved some of its defenses like Buk and S-300 missile launchers, along with its primary radio intelligence command and control center to new sites before the war began, senior Ukrainian officials said. Russian missiles often hit the old locations instead. In all, as many as 60 percent of Russian cruise missiles missed their intended targets, American officials said. Part of Russias problem was agility. Even if Russian forces had spotted Oleksii and his fellow pilots bunched together at their new rendezvous point, American officials said, Russias military was so rigid and centralized that it typically needed 48 to 72 hours to update its intelligence and get approval to go after new targets by which time the Ukrainians were gone. That same inflexibility made the Russians easy to hit. After failing to take out Ukraines defenses, many Russian pilots kept flying as if they had. Their ground-attack planes often flew sorties without backup from other fighter jets, the Ukrainians said, enabling outgunned pilots like Oleksii to catch them off-guard by flying at low altitudes, hidden from radar, and roaring up from below to shoot them down.

David Guttenfelder for The New York Times \"Maybe the Russian Army didnt read the Soviet books,\" Oleksii said. \"They flew straight without any cover. They had bombs, they had rockets, but they didnt cover their attack aircraft.\" Then in March, when Russian pilots finally changed tactics and started flying low enough to duck under Ukrainian air defense radar, they fell into the sights of Ukrainian missiles, including shoulder-fired Stingers provided by the United States. For Russian troops on the ground, it was a disaster. Without air cover, they were suddenly far more vulnerable, throwing their troubled march toward Kyiv and other large cities further into disarray. Though tens of thousands of them had amassed along Ukraines borders, hovering menacingly as if eager to strike, many never thought they were actually going to war. Like most of Russia, they figured it was just for show, to extract concessions from the West. Interviews with Russian soldiers show how stunned they were when the orders came to invade. Cpl. Nikita Chibrin, a 27-year-old soldier in a motorized infantry brigade, said he had spent the month before in Belarus on what he and his fellow soldiers were told was a training exercise. On Feb. 23, he said, he and his unit were at their camp celebrating the Defender of the Fatherland holiday, snacking on candy they had been given for the occasion, when their commander approached. \"Tomorrow you are going to Ukraine to fuck up some shit,\" he said the commander told them. There was no further explanation. Before dawn on the 24th, Corporal Chibrin and his comrades loaded into a tracked armored personnel carrier. They had no instructions and no idea where they were headed, he said. Another Russian soldier stationed in Belarus said he found out he was going to war only an hour before his unit began to march. The order was both simple and wildly optimistic: Follow the vehicle in front of you and reach Kyiv within 18 hours. According to the units schedule and logbook which were obtained by The Times and reviewed by three independent military analysts, who considered them authentic the first vehicles in his convoy were supposed to punch down from Belarus and arrive on the outskirts of Kyiv by 2:55 p.m., even faster than the soldier was told. A Russian military timetable showing a detailed schedule of movement for airborne troops set to depart Belarus, and arrive on Kyivs outskirts. Source: Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. He didnt come close. The massive vehicles were so heavy, ripping up the roads as they tried to move forward, that the convoy got bogged down immediately, the soldier said. It took more than a day just to cross the border into Ukraine. It got worse from there. The logbook recorded day after day of delays, Ukrainian attacks and hundreds of injuries, deaths and destroyed vehicles. Secret orders for a different Russian force obtained by The Times and shared with four independent military analysts, all of whom said they were credible were issued only hours before Mr. Putins announcement. The orders, for a unit of the 26th Tank Regiment, were oddly overconfident, to the point of being contradictory. They anticipated a tangle of possible resistance from Ukrainian troops and planes, yet they still laid out a mostly uninhibited, 24-hour dash from Ukraines border with Russia to a point across the Dnipro River, about 250 miles away. There, the unit would dig in, about two hours outside Kyiv, and block Ukrainian troops sweeping in from the south and east, the Russian war plans said. And no matter how fierce the enemy was, the unit was expected to complete the mission on its own. A document recovered from the 26th tank regiment detailing invasion plans issued on Feb. 23, 2022. \"There are no forces or equipment for reinforcements,\" the orders said. Sure enough, the lumbering, largely unprotected Russian columns proved enticing targets. On March 17, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukrainian forces, posted a video of burning tanks that he said belonged to the 26th Tank Regiment in northeastern Ukraine hundreds of kilometers short of its intended destination. The unit lost 16 vehicles in less than three weeks, according to Russian documents seized and published by Ukraine. The mother of one young tank soldier on the units roster told Russian media that her son was brought home in pieces, identified only by his DNA. Across Ukraine, the Russian losses mounted. A giant armored column of more than 30,000 troops at the core of Russias force pushing south toward the city of Chernihiv was eviscerated by a motley group of Ukrainian defenders outnumbered five to one, soldiers and senior officials said. The Ukrainians hid in the forest and picked apart the Russian column with shoulder-fired antitank weapons, like American-made Javelins. A Ukrainian soldier carrying an NLAW anti-tank guided missile as he walks toward a destroyed Russian armored column at a junction near Ivankiv, northwest of Kyiv, filmed between Feb. 24-26. Lyubov Shelkovich, via Facebook One Russian soldier in the unit said he was shocked by the swiftness of the Ukrainian attack. \"In the first battle, the column was ambushed, and I was wounded, and thats it,\" he said. \"For 24 hours, I was missing a leg, lying in a field waiting for my unit to come get me.\" The rout near Chernihiv spoiled part of Russias plan to envelop Kyiv. Ukrainian soldiers walking along a street where a column of Russian military vehicles was destroyed near Chernihiv in April. Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times A massacre at the Antonov Airport spoiled another. Russian forces had counted on the element of surprise when wave upon wave of helicopters descended on the airport, home to the largest aircraft in the world: the An-225 Mriya, a cargo plane with a 290-foot wingspan that was an object of Ukrainian national pride. Taking the airport would give Russian forces a beachhead to ferry in troops for the assault on Ukraines capital. But the Ukrainians expected as much. Using shoulder-fired missiles, they shot down Russian aircraft and killed as many as 300 Russian paratroopers, according to senior American and Ukrainian officials and the captured Russian logbook. Fierce battles in the following days destroyed much of the airport, including the prized Mriya cargo jet, but thwarted Russias plans. \"Yes, we lost our Mriya,\" said Col. Yuriy Ignat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force Command. \"But as a result the airport wasnt lost.\" Russia not only botched the attack by land and air, but also put too much faith in another wing of its vaunted arsenal: hacking. Even before the first missiles and shots were fired, unit 74455 of the Russian Military Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., tried to infiltrate Ukrainian networks and shut them down. Officials in Washington, who had been working closely with the Ukrainians to bolster their cyberdefenses for years, had been holding their breath. States had mainly used hacking for acts of espionage and financial thievery, for subversion and sabotage. But nobody really knew how it would play out in a full-scale military conflict. \"All this stuff that has been written about cyberwar has been speculative,\" said a senior U.S. defense official. \"For the first time, you have war and cyber together the real thing.\" The Russian hacking unit, known as Sandworm, had long menaced Ukraine, waging attacks against the power grid starting in 2015. But it was labor intensive, and only somewhat effective. By one estimate, it took Sandworm about 19 months to prepare the attack on a power station in western Ukraine, yet it only caused a six-hour power outage. A snippet of code used by hackers to try to disable Ukrainian government computers. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency A cyber cat-and-mouse game ensued, with the United States, Britain and other allies helping to shore up Ukrainian computers and stave off Russian intrusions. On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained. Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors another fail. Sandworm wasnt done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian militarys satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraines most vulnerable moment. It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion. Russia had assumed its forces would march largely uncontested into Kyiv. When that didnt happen, American officials suspect that Sandworm like the rest of the Russian military was caught off guard. Soon, Russias missteps went from the sophisticated to the mundane. With their plans for a speedy victory stymied, Russian forces were suddenly confronted with the most basic of problems: They hadnt brought enough food, water or other supplies for a prolonged campaign. Soldiers resorted to looting grocery stores, hospitals and homes. Security camera footage showing Russian soldiers looting a shop, said to be in Kherson, on Feb. 28. u_now, via Telegram \"The guys were going from apartment to apartment and taking out large bags looting in all its glory,\" one Russian soldier wrote in mid-March in his diary, which was recovered by Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine and shared with a Times reporter embedded with them. \"Some take only what they need, some take everything, from old nonfunctional phones to plasma TVs, computers, and expensive alcohol.\" In the diary, the soldier recounts hunting for medicine, food and other essentials, describing the joy his men felt entering a grocery store. \"We found everything that we lacked so much, even sweets,\" the soldier wrote. \"Everyone rejoiced like children.\" A page from the diary of a Russian soldier, recovered by Ukrainian troops, that described scavenging for candy and socks. He recounts nearly dying in a mortar attack and stalking a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier. But just as often, he appears concerned with basic provisions for himself and his comrades, describing how they scoured a hospital and came up with jam, cookies and raisins. Two days later, he had more luck. \"I found socks that are now worth their weight in gold,\" he wrote. Some Russian troops panicked, and even resorted to self-sabotage. One Pentagon intelligence report said that Russian military drivers were poking holes in their gas tanks, disabling their own vehicles to avoid going into battle. The commander of a Ukrainian tank repair depot said some 30 Russian T-80 tanks in seemingly perfect condition were taken and delivered to him at the beginning of the war. When his mechanics inspected, they found sand had been poured into the fuel tanks, rendering them inoperable. Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus. Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time. \"We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,\" said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. \"They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.\" Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets. \"We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,\" the official said. The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraines armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the units location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said. The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence. They stayed. \"We didnt lose Ukraine. We didnt let the enemy move further,\" the official said. \"On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.\"\n\nHubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Consumed by his legacy, stewing in resentment against the West, Mr. Putin drove his country to war to seal his place in Russian history. Hubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him.

He boasted of wielding a modernized military behemoth, a far cry from its post-Soviet shell. Watching from afar, the West believed him. William J. Burns, the director of the C.I.A., flew to Moscow, sat in a conference room near the Kremlin and waited until the formalities were over before explaining the real reason he had come. It was early November 2021. The United States believed Mr. Putin was considering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Burns explained. If he proceeded down this path, Mr. Burns warned, the West would respond decisively, in unison and the consequences for Russia would be severe. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Mr. Putins security council, stiffened and looked Mr. Burns in the eye, officials in the room said. He abandoned his notes and extolled the prowess of Russias armed forces. They had been so thoroughly modernized under Mr. Putin that they now rivaled the United States militarily, he said. \"Patrushev didnt qualify it,\" said John Sullivan, the American ambassador to Russia at the time, who was there. \"He was just looking at Burns and saying: We can do this. Were back. The way I would describe it was that this was already decided, and they were supremely confident. His message was, Its not going to be a problem for us to do what we want to do.\" Mr. Burns briefed Mr. Biden upon his return to Washington, officials said. Mr. Putin had all but made up his mind to take over Ukraine, Mr. Burns told him, and the Russians had absolute confidence victory would come swiftly. To Mr. Putin, Ukraine is an artificial nation, used by the West to weaken Russia. He describes it as a cradle of Russian culture, a centerpiece of Russian identity that must be wrested back from the West and returned to Russias orbit. In his eyes, that is the biggest unfinished mission of his 22 years in power, people who know him say. He began as an unassuming bureaucrat-turned-president on New Years Eve, 1999, seen by the inner circle of his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, as a proficient manager who could bring stability without threatening the ruling elite. By his third decade in power, Mr. Putin seems transformed, people who have known him since the 1990s say. He styles himself as a pivotal figure astride a millennium of Russian history as he hinted when he unveiled a statue of Vladimir the Great, the medieval prince of Kyiv, outside the Kremlin walls in 2016. That Vladimir \"entered history as a uniter and protector of Russian lands,\" Mr. Putin said. The Vladimir at Russias helm in the 21st century, Mr. Putin has increasingly made plain, sees himself as carrying on that tradition. \"If everyone around you is telling you for 22 years that you are a super-genius, then you will start to believe that this is who you are,\" said Oleg Tinkov, a former Russian banking tycoon who turned against Mr. Putin this year. \"Russian businesspeople, Russian officials, the Russian people they saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Mr. Putin rose to power as a deft politician. He could flash charm, humility and a smile, painting himself as a reasonable leader to Russians and foreigners. He knew how to control his facial muscles in tense conversations, leaving his eyes as the only guide to his emotions, people who know him said. But during his presidency, he increasingly wallowed in a swirl of grievances and obsessions: the Wests supposed disregard for the Soviet Unions role in defeating Nazi Germany; the fear that NATO would base nuclear missiles in Ukraine to strike Moscow; modern-day gender politics in which, Mr. Putin often says, Mom and Dad are being replaced by \"Parent No. 1 and Parent No. 2.\" In the personalist system he has built, those quirks have global consequences. \"What he thinks about obsessively, and quite possibly falsely,\" has ended up shaping \"the biography of the whole world,\" said Konstantin Remchukov, a Moscow newspaper editor. Mr. Putin seemed to think that only he truly understood Ukraine. After annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, Mr. Putin bragged that he had overruled his own advisers, who had considered the move too dangerous because of the risk of sanctions and a Ukrainian military response. Back then, Mr. Putins instincts mostly proved right. The Ukrainian military withdrew swiftly from Crimea some soldiers and sailors switched sides to join Russia and the Wests limited sanctions scarcely affected Russias economy, sealing Mr. Putins confidence. \"I took responsibility for everything,\" Mr. Putin said after taking Crimea, according to a confidant. \"I will be gone sooner or later, but Crimea will have been returned to Russia forever.\" A pro-Russian rally on Crimea in 2014, the year Russia seized the peninsula. Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Many of the people closest to Mr. Putin had an incentive to cater to the bosss rising self-regard and to magnify the external threats and historical injustices that Mr. Putin saw himself as fighting against. A former Putin confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social media algorithm, feeding users content that provokes an emotional reaction. \"They read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff,\" he said. By the summer of 2021, during a meeting that was supposed to be about the economy, Mr. Putin railed instead against the West and President George W. Bushs withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, which Mr. Putin often cites as one of Americas great post-Cold War sins. \"We tried to partner with the West for many years, but the partnership was not accepted, it didnt work,\" Mr. Putin said, recalled his guest, who sat on the other end of a long table. The words had a sort of finality to them, the visitor said: \"It was like he was talking to himself, not to me.\" The guest had spent three days in quarantine before meeting with Mr. Putin at a distance of roughly 15 feet. It was a \"light\" option the Kremlin offered to people who sought face time with Mr. Putin but wanted to avoid the lengthy quarantines required for an up-close meeting with him, even in the pandemics second year.

Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik, via Reuters Mr. Putins isolation deepened his radicalization, people who know him say. He went 16 months without meeting a single Western leader in person. He held just about all his meetings by videoconference from nondescript rooms that left his exact location a mystery. Those who got to see him in person saw their influence rise in a system in which access to Mr. Putin referred to as \"the boss\" or \"V.V.,\" his first initials, by insiders is the most valuable of currencies. \"Our most important resource is not a medal, not money and not possession of anything,\" said Konstantin Zatulin, a member of Parliament in Mr. Putins United Russia party. \"Our main, most important resource is access to the president.\" On that score, Yuri Kovalchuk, a conservative physicist and banking magnate who befriended Mr. Putin in the 1990s, did well during the pandemic. Mr. Kovalchuk bragged last year that he had spent several months in 2020 with Mr. Putin at his residence on Lake Valdai, between St. Petersburg and Moscow, according to a person who met with him then. Mr. Kovalchuk told the person that Mr. Putins main achievement was \"militarization\" the creation of an army and a society ready for war. The secretive Mr. Kovalchuk prides himself as a strategist who sees Russia locked in an existential battle with the West, according to people who know him. In the last decade, he has expanded his television and newspaper holdings, key parts of the Kremlins propaganda apparatus. A onetime Putin confidant said Mr. Kovalchuk sees himself \"as a visionary,\" and the pandemic, given the extraordinary precautions Mr. Putin took, emerged as an opportunity for Mr. Kovalchuk to deepen his imprint on the president and the nation. Mr. Putins unfinished business with Ukraine also fed a growing personal animus toward Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, at a news conference in Kyiv in March. Lynsey Addario for The New York Times When Mr. Zelensky was elected in a landslide in 2019, the Kremlin saw him as someone it could work with: a Russian-speaking comedian who had lived in Moscow, performed on Russian television and won with a message of ending the war in eastern Ukraine that Russia had fueled. And partly because Mr. Zelensky is Jewish, some in Moscow expected him to be tough on Ukraines nationalist wing, which venerated Ukrainian independence fighters who had fought alongside the Nazis in the closing battles of World War II. \"I think he is sincerely willing\" to compromise with Russia, Mr. Putin said of Mr. Zelensky in 2019. \"It is his sincere conviction, at least his striving.\" By early 2021, the Kremlins hopes had been dashed. Mr. Zelensky cracked down on pro-Russian interests in Ukraine, shutting down pro-Russian television channels and sanctioning Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch close to Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin showed his frustration in a long meeting at his Sochi residence with Mr. Bennett, the new prime minister of Israel, in October 2021. Mr. Putin charmed his guest, taking him into his private residence and pouring him a glass of whiskey. But when it came to Ukraine, Mr. Putin flashed anger. Mr. Bennett noted that Mr. Zelensky was interested in meeting Mr. Putin face to face. \"I have nothing to discuss with this person,\" Mr. Putin shot back, according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"What kind of Jew is he? Hes an enabler of Nazism.\" Some Western officials believe that, by that point, Mr. Putin may have already decided to go to war. But in Russia, even among those with access to Mr. Putin or his inner circle, almost no one thought that the president was seriously considering a full-scale invasion, people close to the Kremlin said. They were sure he was bluffing. Mr. Remchukov, the newspaper editor, was one of them. As the chairman of the 2018 election campaign of Mayor Sergei S. Sobyanin of Moscow Mr. Putins former chief of staff he felt well-connected enough to happily announce to his wife a week before the invasion, \"Lena, there wont be a war!\" That day, he had met for two hours with several senior military officials. Rather than betray any hint of tension, they bantered about Mr. Remchukovs newly svelte physique, queried him in detail about his weight-loss regimen and casually discussed their vacation plans for early March. After he came home and described the meeting to his wife, he said, \"she kissed me and said: What happiness!\" The Americans, by contrast, feared the worst. On Feb. 22, two days before the invasion, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, went to the Pentagon and said his nation desperately needed Stingers, the shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III offered to help before asking how the Ukrainian government planned to keep running after the Russians invaded. \"If you get pushed out of Kyiv,\" he said, \"where are you going to go?\" Mr. Kuleba replied: \"I cant even acknowledge that. Were not even going to talk about that or think about that.\" \"Yeah, I got that,\" Mr. Austin said. \"But you need a plan.\" Soon, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined in, launching into what a senior American defense official described as a \"youre going to die speech.\" \"Theyre going to roll into Kyiv in a few days,\" General Milley said. \"Theyre coming in with tanks and columns of formations. You need to be ready for that. You need to be prepared. If youre not, its going to be a slaughter.\" As General Milley spoke, Mr. Kuleba and members of his delegation sat back in their chairs, their eyes widening. The Ukrainian air force had trained with NATO members since 2011, and the partnership deepened after Russia took Crimea in 2014. Wary of another invasion, they carried out combat exercises in Ukraine and California, preparing the nations air force to take on its technologically superior enemy. In February, a secretive U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard team called Grey Wolf was set up at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to support the Ukrainians. But General Milley still harbored serious doubts about Ukraines state of readiness. He had walked the halls of the Pentagon that winter with an enormous green map of Ukraine, with increasingly ominous projections from U.S. intelligence agencies of Russias invasion plans. Whats more, the American defense attach at the embassy in Kyiv had spent weeks trying to get Ukraines defensive plans, and the ones she received minimized, in the Pentagons view, the Russian threat. Mr. Austin seemed somewhat uncomfortable at General Milleys blunt admonishment of the Ukrainian foreign minister and chimed in, reassuringly: \"Were going to do what we can to help these guys.\" The reality was slow to sink in for many in Moscow, too. Mr. Zatulin, a senior Putin ally in Russias Parliament, said he got his first inkling that the president was serious about an invasion in mid-February. Though known as a leading expert on Ukraine, Mr. Zatulin said he was never consulted on the possibility. To the contrary, Mr. Zatulin said he was scheduled to give an address to the Russian Parliament on behalf of Mr. Putins United Russia party on Feb. 15 that was supposed to signal the opposite that there would be no invasion unless Mr. Zelensky himself went on the offensive in Ukraines divided east. But just five minutes before the session was scheduled to start, Mr. Zatulin said, he got a message from an aide: The partys leadership had canceled his speech. \"I was not ready for this turn of events,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"Everything connected to this decision turned out to be a surprise not just for me, but also for a great many of the people in power.\" Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putins spokesman, insisted that he found out about the invasion only once it had begun. Likewise, Anton Vaino, Mr. Putins chief of staff, and Aleksei Gromov, Mr. Putins powerful media adviser, also said they did not know in advance, according to people who spoke to them about it. The best that senior aides could do was to try to read Mr. Putins body language. Some reported with concern that \"hes got this warlike twinkle in his eyes,\" a person close to the Kremlin said. Russian howitzers being loaded onto train cars at a station outside Taganrog, Russia, days before the invasion. The New York Times Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said that amid Russias military buildup around Ukraine late last year, a deputy minister asked him if he knew what was going to happen. \"That means that no one has told the deputy minister,\" Mr. Markov said. \"Even some members\" of Russias security council \"werent told until the last moment.\" Many elites found out too late. Russias main industrial association had been expecting to meet with Mr. Putin in February. On the agenda, among other things: the regulation of cryptocurrencies. But the meeting kept getting rescheduled, until finally, on Feb. 22 or Feb. 23, the Kremlin notified participants of the date: Feb. 24, the day Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. Andrey Melnichenko, a coal and fertilizer billionaire in that lobbying group, described how he woke up that day to the \"madness\" in Ukraine. But the meeting with Mr. Putin was still on, so a few hours later, he was at the Kremlin, as scheduled. In an anteroom, stunned tycoons were munching on sandwiches while awaiting the results of their coronavirus swabs to clear them to share Mr. Putins air. When Mr. Putin finally appeared, the television cameras were rolling. He told the assembled billionaires that he had no choice but to invade. Mr. Putin met with a group of Russian oligarchs at the Kremlin on Feb. 24. \"What happened, in my view, is irrational,\" said Mr. Melnichenko, describing his reaction to the invasion. \"It was shock.\" Another magnate recalled realizing too late that Mr. Putin was parading them in front of the television cameras, for all the world to see, for a carefully planned purpose. The point was \"specifically to tar everyone there,\" he said, \"to get everyone sanctioned.\" There was no going back. They, like the rest of Russia, were in this with Mr. Putin now. Sure enough, Mr. Melnichenko and all the other businessmen who appeared with Mr. Putin that day were hit with sanctions by the West in the months that followed.\n\nDate : 3/5/2022 From : pressa@fsb.ru The distribution of humanitarian aid to local residents was organized March 3-4 of this year in the city of Melitopol on Victory Square ATTENTION MEDIA!

Defeats became accomplishments, as if reflected through a carnival mirror. Despite Russias humiliating failure to seize Ukraines capital, its military sent TV crews a video about Ukrainians supposedly throwing down their NATO-provided guns. As Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv in March, the F.S.B. boasted about the heroics of Russian special forces, claiming they stopped Ukrainians who terrorized pro-Russian civilians.

In some cases, the agency even offered language to hide the source of the information: \"A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE POWER STRUCTURES OF RUSSIA!!!!\" The messages, drawn from tens of thousands of emails leaked from Russias largest state-owned media company and reviewed by The Times, show how at least one engine of the Russian war effort purred along smoothly: the nations propaganda machine. At times, Russias military and the F.S.B. directed coverage down to the video clips played and the time of publication. The emails, leaked from V.G.T.R.K., the state media giant that oversees some of Russias most-watched channels, portrayed Mr. Putins military as backed into a corner by NATO. Once the full invasion began, the machine downplayed Russian atrocities, bolstered conspiracy theories and tried to portray Ukrainian troops as abandoning their posts. (After the emails were released by a group that publishes hacked documents, The Times verified the documents by confirming identities, email addresses and broadcasts on the air.) Off camera, state media employees had little to no idea what was actually happening. A state television journalist said in an interview that as late as April, his Kremlin sources were still assuring him that the war would be over within days. A pro-Russian Ukrainian politician called for Mr. Zelensky to resign on a Russian state-run news channel. \"Tomorrow morning, therell be a statement,\" the journalist recalled one of his sources saying, only to be proved wrong the next day. \"It was really kind of weird.\" But while state broadcasters kept delivering upbeat assessments, Mr. Putin privately acknowledged that his military was struggling. During the meeting in March with Mr. Bennett of Israel when Mr. Putin conceded that the war would be \"much more difficult than we thought\" he returned to the theme that has become a fixation of his presidency: his place in Russian history. Ukraine recaptures the North Kyiv Kharkiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine Kherson CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA \"I wont be the Russian leader who stood by and did nothing,\" he told Mr. Bennett, according to two people familiar with the exchange. Once again, Mr. Putin seemed convinced that future generations of Russians could be threatened by the West. He had spent years preparing for precisely such a clash, devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to Russias military, supposedly to modernize it and strip out the corruption that had sapped it in the 1990s. But while Russia made significant headway, Western officials said, a culture of graft and fraud persisted under Mr. Putin that emphasized loyalty above honesty, or even skill. The result was a hodgepodge of elite troops and bedraggled conscripts, advanced tanks and battalions that were powerful only on paper. \"Everyone was stealing and lying. This was a Soviet, and now Russian, tradition,\" said Col. Vaidotas Malinionis, a retired Lithuanian commander who served in the Soviet military in the 1980s. Looking at satellite images of the army camp where he served, he said the old barracks and mess hall were still there, with no sign of modernization, and a few buildings had fallen down. \"There has been no evolution at all, only regression,\" he said. European, American and Ukrainian officials warned against underestimating Russia, saying it had improved after its muddled invasion of Georgia in 2008. The defense minister overhauled the armed forces, forcibly retired about 40,000 officers and tried to impose more transparency on where money went. \"He made a lot of enemies,\" said Dara Massicot, a RAND researcher who studies the Russian military. Then, in 2012, that minister in charge of dragging the military out of its post-Soviet dysfunction became embroiled in a corruption scandal himself. Mr. Putin replaced him with Sergei K. Shoigu, who had no military experience but was seen as someone who could smooth ruffled feathers. \"Russia drew a lot of lessons from the Georgia war and started to rebuild their armed forces, but they built a new Potemkin village,\" said Gintaras Bagdonas, the former head of Lithuanias military intelligence. Much of the modernization drive was \"just pokazukha,\" he said, using a Russian term for window-dressing. Contractors like Sergei Khrabrykh, a former Russian Army captain, were recruited into the stagecraft. He said he got a panicked call in 2016 from a deputy defense minister. A delegation of officials was scheduled to tour a training base of one of Russias premier tank units, the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, whose history dates to the victories of World War II. Billions of rubles had been allocated for the base, Mr. Khrabrykh said, but most of the money was gone and virtually none of the work had been done. He said the minister begged him to transform it into a modern-looking facility before the delegation arrived. \"They needed to be guided around the territory and shown that the Kantemirovskaya Division was the coolest,\" Mr. Khrabrykh said. He was given about $1.2 million and a month to do the job. As he toured the base, Mr. Khrabrykh was stunned by the dilapidation. The Ministry of Defense had hailed the tank division as a unit that would defend Moscow in case of a NATO invasion. But the barracks were unfinished, with debris strewn across the floors, large holes in the ceiling and half-built cinder-block walls, according to photos Mr. Khrabrykh and his colleagues took. A tangle of electrical wires hung from a skinny pole. \"Just about everything was destroyed,\" he said. The interior of a tank base building. Sergei Khrabrykh The same base after work was done to cover up its state. Sergei Khrabrykh Before the delegation arrived, Mr. Khrabrykh said, he quickly constructed cheap facades and hung banners, covered in pictures of tanks and boasting the army was \"stronger and sturdier year by year,\" to disguise the worst of the decay. On the tour, he said, the visitors were guided along a careful route through the best-looking part of the base and kept away from the bathrooms, which had not been repaired. After the invasion started, the Kantemirovskaya Division pressed into northeastern Ukraine, only to be ravaged by Ukrainian forces. Crews limped away with many of their tanks abandoned or destroyed. Russian prosecutors have pursued thousands of officers and others for corruption in recent years: One colonel was accused of embezzling money meant for vehicle batteries, another of fraud around mobile kitchens. The deputy chief of the general staff was charged with defrauding the state over radio gear, and a major general sentenced to prison in the case. In 2019, Russias chief military prosecutor said that more than 2,800 officers had been disciplined over corruption violations in the past year alone. After the invasion, American officials noticed that much of Russias equipment was poorly manufactured or in short supply. Tires on wheeled vehicles fell apart, stalling convoys, while soldiers resorted to crowdfunding for clothes, crutches and other basic supplies as the war wore on. But even more consequential than the corruption, officials and analysts said, were the ways Mr. Putin fundamentally misunderstood his own military. Russia had, in fact, spent 20 years getting ready for a radically different kind of war. It had not prepared its military to invade and occupy a country as big and powerful as Ukraine, officials and analysts said. Instead, Russia had largely organized its military to keep U.S. and NATO forces away by inflicting maximum damage from afar. Central to this strategy was a series of outposts Kaliningrad by the Baltic, Crimea in the Black Sea, and the Syrian port of Tartus on the Mediterranean to use long-range missiles to keep Western forces at bay. In the event of conflict, Russia intended to blind the enemy and destroy it from a distance, American officials said. But in this case, Russia did not crush Ukraine with weeks of missile strikes in advance. It marched in quickly with forces on the ground. Unlike its more limited campaigns in places like Syria or the big hypothetical war with NATO it had long planned for the invasion of Ukraine was simply \"not what the Russian military was designed to do,\" putting it in a position it was probably \"least prepared\" to deal with, said Clint Reach, a researcher at RAND. In other words, the Kremlin picked the \"stupidest\" of all potential military options by rushing forward and trying to take over Ukraine, said General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. Russia had not trained its infantry, air and artillery forces to work in concert, move quickly and then do it all again from a new location, officials said. It did not have a clear Plan B after the march on Kyiv failed, and commanders had long been afraid to report bad news to their bosses. Russian aims get smaller Throughout the summer, Russia makes incremental gains in the East.

The mounting failures drove a cadre of pro-Russian military bloggers to a boiling point. While still cheerleaders for the war, they began to openly criticize Russias performance. \"Ive been keeping quiet for a long time,\" the blogger Yuri Podolyaka said in May, after hundreds of soldiers died in a river crossing. \"Due to stupidity I emphasize, because of the stupidity of the Russian command at least one battalion tactical group was burned, possibly two.\" A Ukrainian soldier atop an abandoned Russian tank at a river crossing where hundreds of Russian soldiers died. Ivor Prickett for The New York Times The fury eventually reached Mr. Putin himself. On the sidelines of his marquee annual economic conference in St. Petersburg in June, the president held a meeting that had become a tradition: a sit-down with news media chiefs. This time, though, the bloggers were the headline guests. Mr. Putin sat alone at one end in a cavernous hall, according to one attendee, who provided a photo of the private gathering. Some of the bloggers took the floor and peppered Mr. Putin with messages and complaints from the front. \"It became a very concrete conversation, a surprising one for us,\" the person present said. \"Wed never had such conversations.\" It appeared to the person there that Russias intelligence agencies were using the bloggers to shift the blame for the wars failings to the Ministry of Defense. Mr. Zatulin, the Putin ally in Parliament, insisted he supported the war, but said a blame game has broken out, and took a side himself. \"Of course, to a certain degree, we now have an element of everyone wanting to dump the responsibility on someone else,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"But I think that the main miscalculations,\" he added, \"were made by the Defense Ministry and the General Staff\" the militarys top brass.\n\nCollapsing Front\n\n\"Nobody is going to stay alive.\" Ruslan was 54 years old, at war in Ukraine, and seemed to be learning to use his weapon on the fly.

With his marksmans rifle, bundle of papers and copies of his Russian passport in his pack, Ruslan was one of thousands of poorly trained, underequipped men asked to defend a huge swath of territory that Russia had seized in northeastern Ukraine. By summers end, Russian leaders had sent their best troops far to the south, leaving skeleton crews behind. So when the Ukrainians swept in and attacked the northeast, hoping to recapture occupied land, soldiers like Ruslan were cut down or melted away in a chaotic retreat. Military analysts had warned of such a danger before the invasion. Even as tens of thousands of Russian soldiers massed ominously along Ukraines borders, they said, the Kremlin had not sent enough to occupy the entire country. The Russian war plans for the 26th Tank Regiment signaled the same problem: Expect no reinforcements. Russia managed to take territory, frequently at enormous cost. But how to keep it was often an afterthought. \"The army, the generals, the soldiers werent ready,\" said Mr. Tsaryov, the man American officials identified as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install in Ukraine. A kindergarten classroom near Izium was used as a base by retreating Russian soldiers and emblazoned with the military symbol \"Z\" in September. Nicole Tung for The New York Times He said the Russian Army had spread itself so thin across Ukraine after invading that it \"would move through cities and not leave behind even a garrison, even a small one to stick up a Russian flag and defend it.\" In the northeastern region of Kharkiv, Russian commanders put men like Ruslan at roadblocks and moved on.

The rifle next to him suggested he was a sniper. But while snipers in modern militaries often go through weeks of additional special training, Ruslans teacher appeared to be the internet. \"Hello dear soldier!\" read the unsigned letter in his pack. \"You have to risk your life so that we can live peacefully. Thanks to you and your comrades our army remains so strong, mighty and can protect us from any enemy.\" More than 50 pages of Russian documents, collected from three towns in the Kharkiv region and reviewed by The Times, show a timeless truth: Foot soldiers bear the outsize burden of combat. The documents shared with three independent military experts, who considered them credible detail how Russia relied on bedraggled backup forces, many of them separatist fighters from Ukraines long conflict in its divided east, to hold territory as the regular Russian Army fought hundreds of miles away. The 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine was one of them. It had nearly 2,000 men, but was almost completely dependent on foot soldiers. More than a dozen pages of its rosters detail the particulars of the units suffering, down to a lack of warm clothing and boots. Several of its soldiers were in their 50s, including one who experienced \"cardiac failure,\" while one of its youngest casualties, a 20-year-old named Vladimir, endured \"frostbite of the lower limbs.\" Yet another complained on a phone call intercepted by the Ukrainians that he had no armored vest and a helmet from the 1940s. An excerpt from a roster of soldiers from the 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic. \"Our battalion, for instance, has already gone more than three weeks without receiving ammunition from the army,\" the pro-Russian militia commander, Mr. Khodakovsky, said on Telegram in September. In an interview, another soldier described having only the vaguest sense of how to use his weapon. He recounted being advised to fire judiciously, one round at a time, rather than blasting his rifle uncontrollably. But he wasnt sure how to do that. So, shortly before going into combat, he said, he turned to a commander and asked how to switch his rifle off fully automatic. Russia came to rely on such battered, inexperienced troops after months of tactics that more closely resembled 1917 than 2022. Commanders sent waves of troops into the range of heavy artillery, eking out a few yards of territory at grievous tolls. When one Russian unit arrived in eastern Ukraine, it was quickly whittled down to a haggard few, according to one of its soldiers. During fighting in the spring, he said, his commanders ordered an offensive, promising artillery to support the attack. It never came, he said, and his unit was devastated. Yet commanders sent them right back into the melee all the same. \"How much time has passed now? Nine months, I think?\" he said. \"In this whole time, nothing has changed. They have not learned. They have not drawn any conclusions from their mistakes.\" He recounted another battle in which commanders sent soldiers down the same path to the front, over and over. On each trip, he said, bodies fell around him. Finally, after being ordered to go a fifth time, he and his unit refused to go, he said. In all, he said, his unit lost about 70 percent of its soldiers to death and injury, ruining any faith he had in his commanders. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" he said. \"One way or another, one weapon or another is going to kill you.\" American officials realized early on that they had vastly overestimated Russias military. The morale of rank-and-file soldiers was so low, the Americans said, that Russia began moving its generals to the front lines to shore it up. But the generals made a deadly mistake: They positioned themselves near antennas and communications arrays, making them easy to find, the Americans said. Ukraine started killing Russian generals, yet the risky Russian visits to the front lines continued. Finally, in late April, the Russian chief of the general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, made secret plans to go himself. American officials said they found out, but kept the information from the Ukrainians, worried they would strike. Killing General Gerasimov could sharply escalate the conflict, officials said, and while the Americans were committed to helping Ukraine, they didnt want to set off a war between the United States and Russia. The Ukrainians learned of the generals plans anyway, putting the Americans in a bind. After checking with the White House, senior American officials asked the Ukrainians to call off the attack. \"We told them not to do it,\" a senior American official said. \"We were like, Hey, thats too much.\" The message arrived too late. Ukrainian military officials told the Americans that they had already launched their attack on the general's position. Dozens of Russians were killed in the strike, officials said. General Gerasimov wasnt one of them. Russian military leaders scaled back their visits to the front after that.\n\nDivided Ranks\n\n\"Wagner almost always fights alone.\" They deployed tanks, heavy artillery and fighter jets.

Mr. Prigozhin the close confidant of Mr. Putin, known for stirring up trouble across the Middle East and Africa with his mercenary army, Wagner came to Mr. Nuzhins prison south of Moscow in August, looking for recruits. Heaving with patriotic fervor, Mr. Prigozhin gave the kind of speech he has delivered at other Russian prisons in recent months, some shared online. In one, also from August, Mr. Prigozhin, dressed in a drab beige uniform, promised pardons for the inmates who made it back from Ukraine alive. Those who didnt, he said, would \"be buried in the alleys of the heroes.\" He also issued a warning: Anyone thinking of deserting his forces once in Ukraine, he said in the video, would be shot. Mr. Nuzhin accepted Mr. Prigozhins offer, but ignored the warning. After two days at the front, where he spent his time collecting the bodies of dead Wagner soldiers, he used the cover of darkness to slip away and surrender to Ukrainian troops. \"What good has Putin done in the time that he has been in power? Has he done anything good?\" Mr. Nuzhin told The Times after being taken into Ukrainian custody. \"I think this war is Putins grave.\" Yevgeny Nuzhin, 55, a Russian prisoner of war held by Ukraine, in October. Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times Mr. Putins reliance on mercenaries and convicts is one of the more unusual features of his war in Ukraine. Mr. Prigozhin is just one of a handful of strongmen active in the war, all of them managed by Mr. Putin, who has carved up the administration of much of Russia into competing fiefs run by people loyal to him above all. Beyond the mercenaries controlled by Mr. Prigozhin, who rose to prominence as a caterer of Kremlin events, there is also the Russian national guard, overseen by Mr. Putins former bodyguard. And there is the unit commanded by the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov whose fighters were found and attacked because of their misadventures on TikTok. As far as officials can tell, the Russian military has limited coordination with any of them. \"There was no unified command, there was no single headquarters, there was no single concept and there was no unified planning of actions and command,\" said General Ivashov, the retired Russian officer who warned the war would go badly. \"It was destined to be a defeat.\" The splintered Russian forces have sparred openly. After Russian forces withdrew from northeast Ukraine in late summer, Mr. Kadyrov called for the Russian commander responsible to be demoted to private and shipped to the front, \"to wash his shame away with blood.\" Mr. Prigozhin weighed in, too: \"All these bastards should go with machine guns barefoot to the front.\" The public finger-pointing has added to a sense of disarray within the Russian war effort. Mr. Putin has replaced several top military commanders. Yet he has stuck with Mr. Shoigu, his defense minister, and with General Gerasimov, the chief of the militarys general staff, because firing them would amount to a public acknowledgment that the war is going badly, an admission Mr. Putin is loath to make, argued General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. \"They are still trying to maintain the illusion that everything is going well,\" he said. The friction has, at times, run all the way down to the troops in the battle zone. After a battlefield argument in the Zaporizhzhia region over the summer, a Russian tank commander drove his T-90 tank not at the enemy but toward a group of Russian national guard troops, firing at their checkpoint and blowing it up, said Fidar Khubaev, describing himself as Russian drone operator who witnessed the episode. \"Those types of things happen there,\" said Mr. Khubaev, adding that he fled Russia in the fall. Of all the supplementary armies charging into Ukraine, Mr. Prigozhins Wagner has become especially pivotal. Its troops have received glowing coverage on Russian state television, and in November they were profiled in a documentary film called \"Wagner: Contract with the Motherland\" produced by RT, one of the Kremlins primary propaganda outlets. \"Until recently, Wagner has been one of the most closed and secretive organizations, but for us they have made a huge exception,\" Andrey Yashchenko, the films presenter, says in the opening montage, which shows tanks rolling through rubble-strewn villages. In the first five months of the war, there was almost no public mention of Wagner or Mr. Prigozhins involvement in Ukraine. By late summer, as the Russian military began to collapse under Ukrainian campaigns in the northeast and south, Mr. Prigozhin stepped into the spotlight. After years of denying any links to Wagner and sometimes its very existence Mr. Prigozhin suddenly went public, making a show of visiting his troops in Ukraine, handing out medals, attending funerals and trumpeting his independence on the battlefield. Mr. Prigozhin attending a soldiers funeral on Sept. 23. v1.ru \"Wagner almost always fights alone,\" he said in an Oct. 14 post on the page of his catering company on VK, a Russian social media site. A Times analysis of videos in Ukraine found that Wagner troops are often showcasing some of Russias most advanced weaponry, including tanks, fighter aircraft and thermobaric rocket launchers. And because of his connection with the president, Mr. Prigozhin is given priority over other military units for arms and equipment, a senior European official said. Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied that Russias separate fighting forces were causing confusion or division, insisting they all report to Russias top military brass. The prominence of Mr. Prigozhin and Mr. Kadyrov, he said, was merely a function of their public-relations efforts. \"Some people are more active in the information space, some people are less active,\" Mr. Peskov said. \"But it doesnt signify any, lets say, independence.\" Despite its weaponry and bravado, Wagner has struggled on the battlefield. Some Ukrainian soldiers say it is a formidable foe. Yet for nearly six months, Wagners troops have been trying to seize the small industrial city of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region, and have been kept at bay by Ukrainian forces at great cost to both sides prompting a rare public acknowledgment of Ukraines fighting prowess. The frontline city of Bakhmut, where Wagner forces have fought for months. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times \"The situation is difficult but stable,\" Mr. Prigozhin said in the Oct. 14 post. \"The Ukrainians are offering dignified resistance. The legend about Ukrainians running away is just that, a legend. Ukrainians are guys with steel balls just like us. This isnt a bad thing. As Slavs, we should take pride in this.\" Hundreds of Wagner troops have been killed in the war, and several of the groups fighter jets have been downed. The convicts Mr. Prigozhin has recruited appear to be little more than cannon fodder and make up a vast majority of casualties among Wagner forces, according to an assessment by Ukraines military intelligence agency, which said in October that about 8,000 Wagner troops were fighting in Ukraine. Another former Russian inmate recruited by Mr. Prigozhin said he was left in a shallow trench at the front lines near Bakhmut for four days with no food or water and little sense of what he was supposed to be doing, other than dragging away the many bodies of his dead comrades. It was no wonder, he said, that some of Wagners recruits decided to flee. To keep control, Mr. Prigozhin has resorted to extreme punishment, showing how the war has whittled away the vestiges of rule of law in Russia. Like Mr. Putin, whose spies have been accused of poisoning and assassinating perceived traitors all over the world, Mr. Prigozhin has said that treachery is the worst sin any Russian can commit. He has proposed setting up his own Gestapo-like police force to hunt down the disloyal, including, he has said, Russian businessmen \"who leave our country in their business jets.\" The fate of Mr. Nuzhin serves as a grisly warning. Mindful of the pressures on prisoners of war and the risks they face, The Times has chosen to withhold their names. And, as with the other people we interviewed, we use documents and other evidence to vet their claims. In Mr. Nuzhins case, we did not publish our interview with him, but he also spoke to Ukrainian media, which broadcast portions of his account. Soon after, he was released in a prisoner swap and ended up back in the hands of Wagner. He then appeared in a video on a pro-Russian Telegram account. In it, Mr. Nuzhins head was taped to a block. Looming over him was a man in camouflage, holding a sledgehammer. \"I woke up in this basement, where I was told that I will be judged,\" Mr. Nuzhin says in the video, his voice dry and gravelly. The sledgehammer then swings down and crushes his skull. Shortly after, Mr. Prigozhin released a statement endorsing Mr. Nuzhins murder. \"Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed them consciously,\" the statement said. \"He planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.\" A day later, asked about the video on a conference call with journalists, Mr. Peskov said, \"Its not our business.\"",

                "cc_text": "East Room\n\n4:44 P.M. EST\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Please, be seated. Thank you.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy, Im honored to welcome you back to the White House.\n\nWeve spent an awful lot of time on the telephone as well as on video, but its good to see you in person again. And weve been in close and frequent communication throughout this conflict from the very beginning, but particularly its particularly meaningful to talk with one another in person look each other in the eye, because leadership through this terrible crisis has inspired the Ukrainian people as you have done, Mr. President and the American people and the entire world.\n\nThis visit to Washington, your first trip outside Ukraine since February, comes as President Putin is escalating his attacks his brutal attacks targeting critical infrastructure to make life as hard as possible for not only innocent Ukrainians but children and young children, and everything from orphanages to schools. Its just outrageous what hes doing.\n\nAs weve as weve heard into and as we head into the new year, its important for the American people and for the world to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraines fight and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.\n\nThis visit also falls on the 300-day mark of Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine. Three hundred days since Putin launched an unprovoked, unjustified, all-out assault on the free people of Ukraine. Three hundred days of Ukrainian people showing Russia and the world their steel backbone, their love of country, and their unbreakable determination and I emphasize \"unbreakable determination\" to choose their own path.\n\nTo Ukrainian people, I say to them all: You have demonstrated you have shown your strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats who wrongfully believed you might you might they might be able to make might right, and theyre not able to do it.\n\nThus far, they have not theyve stood alone. You know, and youve had but you havent stood alone. You have had significant, significant help. Weve never stand alone you will never stand alone.\n\nWhen Ukraines freedom was threatened, the American people like generations of Americans before us did not hesitate.\n\nThe support from all across this country, Americans of every walk of life Democrats and Republicans alike had the resources and the to rebound in resounding, united way to do provide unequivocal and unbending support for Ukraine.\n\nBecause we understand in our bones that Ukraines fight is part of something much bigger. The American people know that if we stand by in the face of such blatant attacks on liberty and democracy and the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the world would surely face worse consequences.\n\nAnd as I said when Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine in February: American American people are prepared to have us stand up to bullies, stand up for freedom. Thats who we are as Americans. And thats exactly what weve done.\n\nEven before the invasion began and Putin threatened Ukraine by building up his forces, we helped make sure Ukraine would be prepared to defend itself even before they crossed into Ukraine.\n\nWe provided a steady stream of defensive weapons, including air defense systems and artillery, ammunition, and so much more. And weve not done it alone.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the United States rallied allies and partners from around the world to stand strong with Ukraine and impose unprecedented and I emphasize \"unprecedented\" sanctions and export controls on Russia, making it harder for the Kremlin to wage its brutal war.\n\nMore than 50 nations have committed nearly 2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles; more than 800 artillery systems; more 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition; and more than fif- more than 50 advanced multiple rocket launching systems; anti-ship and anti- and air defense systems all to strengthen Ukraine.\n\nTogether, weve provided billions of dollars in direct budgetary support to make sure the Ukrainian government can keep providing basic, fundamental services to the Uranian [Ukrainian] people like healthcare, education, and emergency personnel.\n\nThis includes another $2 billion that in direct budget support from the American people that the World Bank distributed earlier this week.\n\nWeve provided humanitarian assistance to help the millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes because of Putins inhumane and brutal war.\n\nCommunities across Europe have opened their hearts and their homes to help Ukrainians in need.\n\nThe United States has been proud to welcome more than 221,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge since March of 2022, including as part of Uniting for Ukraine as part of our Uniting for Ukraine program.\n\nAnd today, USAID is committing more than $374 million in urgently needed humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. This will help provide food and cash assistance for more than 1.5 million Ukrainian people, as well as access to healthcare, safe drinking water, and help stay warm in the winter to more than for more than 2.5 million Ukrainians.\n\nThe United States and our allies and partners around the world have delivered a broad range of assistance at historic speed, and its been critical to bolstering Ukraines success thus far.\n\nUkraine has won the battle of Kyiv, has won the battle of Kherson, has won the battle of Kharkiv. Ukraine has defied Russias expectations at every single turn.\n\nAnd, President Velenskyy [sic] Zelenskyy, you have made it clear he is open to pursuing a well, let me put it this way: Hes not open, but youre open to pursuing peace. Youre open to pursuing a just peace.\n\nWe also know that Putin has no intention no intention of stopping this cruel war. And the United States is committed to ensuring that the brave Ukrainian people can continue continue to defend their country against Russian aggression as long as it takes.\n\nAnd I want to thank the members of Congress and their for their broad bipartisan support to Ukraine. And I look forward to signing the omnibus omnibus bill soon, which includes $45 billion $45 billion in additional funding for Ukraine.\n\nI will also sign into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authori- authorities for to make it easier for the Department of Defense to procure critical munitions and defense materials for Ukraine and other key materials to strengthen our national security.\n\nToday, Im announcing the next tranche of our security assistance to Ukraine: $1.85 billion package of security assistance that includes both direct transfers of equipment to that Ukraine needs, as well as contracts to supply ammunition Ukraine will need in the months ahead for its artillery, its tanks, and its rocket launchers.\n\nCritically, in addition to these new capabilities like precision aerial munitions, the package will include a Patriot missile battery, which will and on which well train Ukrainian forces to operate as part of the ongoing effort to help bolster Ukraines air defense.\n\nIts going to take some time to complete the necessary training, but the Patriot battery will be another critical asset for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression.\n\nAltogether, todays new security assistance with humanitarian funding amounts to $2.2 billion in additional support for the Ukrainian people.\n\nWe should be clear about what Russia is doing. It is purposefully attacking Ukraines critical infrastructure, destroying the systems that provide heat and light to the Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another.\n\nIts the latest example of the outrageous atrocities that Russian forces are committing against innocent Ukrainian civilians children and their families.\n\nAnd the United States is working together with our allies and partners to provide critical equipment to help Ukraine make emergency repairs to their power transmission system and strengthen the stability of Ukraines grid in the face of Russias targeted attacks.\n\nWere also working to hold Russia accountable, including efforts in Congress that will make it easier to seek justice for Russias war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nLet me close with this: Tonight is the fourth nights of night of Hanukkah, a time when Jewish people around the world President Zelenskyy and many of the families among them honor the timeless miracle of a small band of warriors fighting for their values and their freedom against a much larger foe, and how they endured and how they overcame; how the flame of faith, with only enough oil for one day, burned brightly for eight days.\n\nA story of survival and resilience that reminds us that the coldest days of the year, that light will always prevail over darkness, and hope drives away despair; and that the human spirit is unconquerable as long as there are good people willing to do what is right.\n\nThis year has brought so much needless suffering and loss to the Ukrainian people. But I want you to know, President Zelenskyy I want you to know that all the people of Ukraine to know as well: The American people have been with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you. We will stay with you for as long as it takes.\n\nWhat youre doing, what you have achieved, it matters not just to Ukraine but to the entire world.\n\nAnd together, I have no doubt well keep the flame of liberty burning bright, and the light will remain and prevail over the darkness.\n\nThank you for being here, Mr. President. Were going to stand with you.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much. Thank you.\n\n(As interpreted.) Dear Mr. President please put on the equipment.\n\nOnce again, Mr. President, President Biden, audience, journalists, ladies and gentleman: I came here to the United States to forward the thank the word of thanks to the people of America, people who do so much for Ukraine. I am thankful for all of this.\n\nThis visit to the United States became, really, a historic one for our relations with the United States and the American leadership.\n\nIn the last 30 [300] days of this war, we have started a new phase of our inter-relations with the United States. We became real partners and allies with the content, and I felt today during all of my meetings and during our talks.\n\nOnce again, I would like to thank Mr. President, President Biden, for his candid support and what is very important the understanding of Ukraine and for the support of the international coalition to strengthen international law.\n\nI am grateful to President Biden for his personal efforts, his steps that unite the partners in Global South.\n\nWhen all countries of the world take some position and are focusing on cooperation and mutual understanding, this is very useful for all of the countries for Ukraine, for the United States.\n\nI want to thank the Congress for bipartisan, bicameral support. And I am looking forward to good meetings with the members of the Congress and their support. This is the visit that Im here today to meet with the Congress.\n\nThe main issue during todays talks is to strengthen Ukraine next year our movement forward to fight for our freedom and independence.\n\nI have good news returning home: President Biden announced a new package of defense support about 2 billion U.S. dollars. And the strongest element of this package is the Patriot battery systems, something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.\n\nThis is a very important step to create a secure airspace for Ukraine. And thats the only way we would be able to deprive the terrorist country and their terror attack to strike our energy sector, our people, and our infrastructure.\n\nWe had a very good negotiation and talks about our strategic steps which we discussed with President Biden and what we expect next year and for what we are preparing. This is very important for all Ukrainians, and I am hopeful.\n\nAnd once again, thank you, Mr. President, for $45 billion, because this is a big assistance, and I hope that the Congress will approve this financial assistance for our country. This is almost $45 billion. Thank you very much for the support. Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security.\n\nI know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope. And the United States will help us to defend our values and independence.\n\nAnd regardless of changes in the Congress, I believe that there will be bipartisan and bicameral support. And I know that everybody works for this.\n\nAnd, of course, during all of my meetings today, we discussed issues of a standoff against the terror of Russia, their destruction of our energy infrastructure. We need to survive this winter. We need to protect our people. And we need to be very specific in this area. This is a key humanitarian issue for us right now. This is the survival issue.\n\nWe are discussing sanctions and legal pressure on the terrorist country of Russia. Russia needs to be held accountable for everything it does against us, against our people, against Europe, and the whole free world.\n\nAnd it is very important that we have the peace formula. And for that, we offer very specific steps what America can do to help us to implement them.\n\nWe propose global formula for peace summit. Im thankful for our American counterparts, that they feel us and understand how important it is to continue and stay on course and work on integrity of the country and international rule of law.\n\nWe will also need as soon as our defense capabilities will be strengthened in the next few months. I dont want to discuss it in details right now. I believe you understand why. And I but I am very grateful to President Biden. Thank you for your attention to all of these issues.\n\nGlory to Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\nWere going to take questions from four different reporters. Im going to start with Alex of Yahoo News.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. In 2022, you presided over a bipartisan international coalition to support Ukraine. How will you keep that coalition from fraying in 2023?\n\nAnd, President Zelenskyy, welcome to Washington on this beautiful winter day. What is your message to the American people?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, in answering your question first, Im not at all worried about holding the alliance together in NATO and European Union, as well as other nations.\n\n(Translation audio is fed over English line.)\n\nI assume this is simultaneous?\n\nAll right. (Laughs.)\n\nQ Yes, it is.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Okay. Ive never seen NATO or the EU more united about anything at all. And I see no sign of there being any change.\n\nWe all know whats at stake here; our European partners all the more so. They fully understand it. This is about weve never seen a major invasion of a European country since World War Two. And they see no signs of it that Putin is going to do anything to change that unless we resist and we help the Ukrainians resist.\n\nWe all know whats at stake: the very idea of sovereignty, the U.N. Charter.\n\nPutin thought he would weaken NATO; instead, he strengthened NATO. I once said to him that if he talked about the he wanted wanted to see the, you know, Europe end up being divided. The and instead, what did he do? He produced a more united Europe, with Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nSo I dont see any reason to believe there will be any lessening of support. And as we reach out to our NATO Allies our Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State we get continued support. And not only there, but also from around the world from Japan and many other countries as well. So I feel very good about the solidarity of support for Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you for your question. Thank you very much. You asked me, \"What is the message to the American people?\" You know, I think I will tell you very simple things which are important for me. And I and I think so that we have the same values and the same understanding of the life, the sense of the life.\n\nMy message: I wish you peace. I think that is the main thing, and you understand it only when the war in your country, when somebody like these terrorists from Russia come to your houses. And I wish you to see your children alive and adult. And I wish you to see your children when they will go to universities, and to see their children. I I think that is the main thing what I can wish you.\n\nAnd, of course, to be together with us jointly, because we really fight for our common victory against this tyranny. That is real life. And we will win. And I really want win together.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNot \"want.\" Sorry. Im sure. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: You call on one of your people? A press person?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Yeah.\n\n(Speaks in Ukrainian. No translation provided.)\n\nQ Yeah, thank you. Dmytro Anopchenko, Ukrainian television. President Zelenskyy and President Biden, Ive got a question for both of you. But firstly, as a Ukrainian and I mean it I want to thank the United States for supporting my country. And, you know, my family is in Ukraine. And I definitely understand they would not be alive today if America will not support my country, both politically and militarily. So thank you for this. Its (inaudible).\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: We will.\n\nQ And as of my question: We entered a new phase of this war. And you definitely discussed today which path to choose, how the war could come to an end, and whats next will it turn into a new counter-offensive or some kind of peace talks.\n\nSo, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy, could you share your vision? Whats the fair way to end this war? And how do you understand this words for peace? Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: My my view?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Your guy. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: I think we have I see. I see.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Although, I like him very much already. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (As interpreted.) You have started this question you have started by stating that your family is in Kyiv. And without the assistance of the United States this is absolutely true the U.S. leadership in this assistance is strong. And, again, I would like to remind you that your family will be in danger without the armed forces of Ukraine, which are very important. That concerns your questions, per se.\n\nWhat would you like to hear? A just peace? I dont know. I dont know what \"just peace\" is. Its a very philosophical description. If there is a just war I dont know.\n\nYou know, for all of us, peace just peace is different. For me, as the President, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom, and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.\n\nIm sorry, Im reminding Im talking about children a lot today. But as a father, I would like to emphasize: You know how many parents lost their sons or daughters on the frontlines? So, what is just peace for them? Money is nothing. And no compensations or reparations are of no consequence. They live by revenge (inaudible). I think this is a tremendous tragedy.\n\nAnd the longer the war lasts, the longer this aggression lasts, there will be more parents who live for the sake of vengeance or revenge. And I know a lot of people like that.\n\nSo there cant be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these I dont know how to describe that because we are in the White House, and I cant find the proper language so these \"inhumans,\" I would say.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me respond. I think we have the we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous, and secure Ukraine is the vision.\n\nWe both want this war to end. We both want it to end. And as Ive said, it could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just said pulled out. But thats not going to happen. Not going to happen. Its not going to happen now.\n\nSo what comes next? What we talked about today was were going to continue to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield. It can succeed in the battlefield with our help, and the help of our European allies and others, so that if and when President Zelenskyy is ready to talk with the Russians, he will be able to succeed as well, because he will have won on the battlefield.\n\nAnd, you know, I I dont think we should underestimate the impact this war is having on Russia and the losses theyre suffering. And you saw just I think it was two days ago Putin saying that this is much tougher than he thought.\n\nHe thought he could break NATO. He thought he could break the West. He thought he could break the Alliance. He thought he could be welcomed by the Ukrainian people that were Russian-speaking. He was wrong, wrong, and wrong. He continues to be wrong. And the sooner he makes it its clear that he cannot possibly win this war, thats when the time we have to put the this President in a position to be able to decide how he wants the war to end.\n\nMy turn, huh?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Please, yes. Yeah.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Phil Mattingly of Mattingly of CNN.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome, Mr. President.\n\nMr. President, to start with you: Your advisors often talk about how important how critically important you view face-to-face interaction. Im wondering, after spending two-plus hours face-to-face with President Zelenskyy, what you learned or what you took from the meeting that perhaps you couldnt glean or learn in the phone calls or video conferences.\n\nAnd somewhat tied to that, was there any discussion related to the U.S. assessments that Russia would not take escalatory action now that Patriots are being sent, will be del- a Patriot battery will be delivered?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me answer the first question the first part of your question. You know, I get kidded for saying that theres all politics is personal. Its all about looking someone in the eye. And I mean it sincerely.\n\nI dont think theres any, any, any substitute for sitting down face-to-face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye. And thats exactly whats happening at this moment. Weve done that more than once, and were going to continue to do it.\n\nAnd the winter is setting in, and Putin is increasingly going after civilian targets and women and children, orphanages. This guy is well\n\nBut but hes going to fail. And hes going to fail. Hes already failed, because he now knows that theres no way hes ever going to occupy all of Ukraine. Theres no way in which hes going to be accepted by the Ukrainian people. And so, hes failed in the past. And it was very important for him and everyone else to see that President Zelenskyy and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed.\n\nAnd I think I may be mistaken, but I know I judge every leader by the way they what they say to me, their consistency, and looking me in the eye.\n\nThis guy (points to President Zelenskyy) has in his to his very soul is who he says he is. Its clear who he is. Hes willing to give his life for his country and all the folks who are with came with him today.\n\nAnd so I think its he its important for him to know we are going to do everything in our power everything in our power to see that he succeeds.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: What was the second part of your question?\n\nQ I just asked if you had discussed how the U.S. calculated the escalatory effect of sending a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I did not discuss that at all with with the President. But I we do not its a defensive system. Its a defensive weapon system. Its not escalatory. Its defensive. And its easy to not and wed love to not have to have them use it. Just stop the attacks.\n\nQ President Zelenskyy, again, welcome. You mentioned earlier that you wanted to make this trip for a while now. Why now?\n\nAnd also, can you tell me what you think the message you are sending to President Putin is, given the fact that 24 hours ago, you were on the ground, in the frontlines, with artillery echoing behind you, and now you find yourself in the White House standing next to the President?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (As interpreted.) Thank you very much for your question. As to what is the message for Putin, I am standing here in the United States with President Biden on the same podium because I respect him as a person, as a President, as a human being for his position. And for me, this is a historic moment.\n\nI can send messages to President Biden. For example, if its not serious you said, \"Whats going to happen after Patriots are installed?\" After that, we will send another signal to President Biden that we would like to get more Patriots. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Were working on it.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (Speaks English.) That is our life. We are in war. Im sorry. Im really sorry. (Laughter.) That is my appreciation.\n\n(As interpreted.) As to President Putin: In 2019, we had a Normandy meeting. In 2019, I became the President of Ukraine. And at that time, we were sending maximum messages to President Putin, telling him that there shouldnt be a full-scale invasion, to stop aggression, to renew our territorial integrity, to find diplomatic solution, or, God forbid, we should not have a full-scale war.\n\nAt that time, he said, \"It wont happen.\" He was lying. So what kind of message I can send him after he actually\n\ndestroyed our life, is destroying our life? He can even go further somewhere where the Soviet Union stayed before this, so he might want to invade those territories too.\n\nI believe that there is something mortal about his inadequate approach to the world. Why we need to send him a message? He needs to be interested in getting attention from the world, because he is not a subject of civilized people. He should be interested in trying to save something of his culture and history of his country. So thats his problem now.\n\n(Speaks Ukrainian.) (No translation provided.)\n\nAIDE: This will be the last question.\n\nQ Olga Koshelenko, 1+1 tv channel. When the full-scale invasion started, U.S. officials said that Ukraine cannot receive Patriots because, as you said, it might be unnecessary escalation. And now it is happening. Right now, today, it is happening. And now Ukraine desperately needs more capabilities, including long-range missiles ATACMS.\n\nMaybe I sound nave, but can we make long story short and give Ukraine all capabilities it needs and liberate all territories rather sooner than later? Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, th- his answer is yes. (Points to President Zelenskyy.) (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (Laughs.) I agree. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me be straightforward with you here. Look, the fact is that its important to remember that before Russia invaded, we had dedicated an enormous amount of security assistance to Ukraine. And and weve given Ukraine what they needed when they needed to defend themselves. And since the invasion, that has resulted in more than $20 billion, in terms of security assistance.\n\nJust today, I approved another $1.8 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine for it to succeed on the battlefield. And were focused on working with allies and partners to generate capability in four key areas:\n\nAir defense. As kno- as we know today, the Patriot is the best of that.\n\nSecondly is to and were looking to do more. We provided hundreds of advanced artillery systems and dozens from dozens of countries.\n\nThirdly, weve worked with partners to get Ukraine tanks and other armored vehicles.\n\nAnd fourthly, weve announced today another 200,000 rounds of additional ammunition.\n\nNow, you say, \"Why dont we just give Ukraine everything there is to give?\" Well, for two reasons. One, theres an entire Alliance that is critical to stay with Ukraine. And the idea that we would give Ukraine material that is fundamentally different than is already going there would have a prospect of breaking up NATO and breaking up the European Union and the rest of the world.\n\nWere going to give Ukraine what it needs to be able to defend itself, to be able to succeed, and succeed in the battlefield.\n\nAnd the other piece of this is, you may recall, one of the reasons why I have spent well, I wont tell you the calculation, but Ive spent several hundred hours face-to-face with our European allies and the heads of state of those countries, and making the case as to why it was overwhelmingly in their interest that they continue to support Ukraine.\n\nThey understand it fully, but theyre not looking to go to war with Russia. Theyre not looking for a third World War. And I think it can all be avoided by making sure that Ukraine is able to succeed in the battlefield.\n\nSo, anyway, theres more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.\n\nWell, thank you all very, very much. I appreciate your time and attention.\n\nAnd as I said, Mr. President, you dont have to worry we are staying with Ukraine as long as Ukraine is there.\n\nThank you all.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much, all you guys.\n\n5:20 P.M.

Repeated missile and drone attacks since October, which have damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure, are part of a strategy by the Kremlin to terrorize Ukrainians and is in violation of the laws of war, according to experts.\n\nUkrainian energy operator Ukrenergo reported on Friday that more than 50% of the countrys energy capacity was lost due to Russian strikes on thermal and hydroelectric power plants and substations, activating \"emergency mode.\"\n\nCivilians shelter inside a metro station during an air raid alert in the centre of Kyiv. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The enemy is massively attacking Ukraine. Increased danger. Stay in shelters,\" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app, asking residents not to ignore the alarm.\n\nKyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions had hit the city and that three districts had been struck in the onslaught of rockets, disrupting water supplies across the capital. He suggested residents prepare a stock of drinking water while technicians work to restore the supply, and not to leave shelters as attacks continued.\n\nResidents bundled in winter coats, hats and scarves gathered in Kyivs underground stations as the sirens wailed. Huddled on escalators, their faces were lit by their phones as they scrolled through updates.\n\nOne photo shared by authorities in the Kyiv region showed the fragments of a missile in the snow, which it said the air defense system had downed. Kyiv citys military administration claimed that 37 of 40 missiles targeted at the capital were intercepted.\n\nRegional and city authorities across the country reported explosions and missile strikes hitting civilian infrastructure, and leading to some deaths.\n\nIn the central city of Kryvyi Rih, officials said a Russian missile had hit a three-story residential building, killing at least two people and that emergency services were digging through the wreckage. \"There may be people under the rubble,\" the deputy head of the presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said.\n\nA residential building damaged by a Russian missile in Kryvyi Rih. State Emergency Service of Ukraine/Reuters\n\nAt least 10 missiles struck various targets in Kharkiv region, in the north, damaging energy facilities and a hospital, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the regional military administration. Power was beginning to be restored in Kharkiv city after being knocked out for much of the day. \"There is a colossal infrastructural damage,\" Kharkivs mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said, instructing residents to use so-called \"invincibility points\" makeshift centers offering relief from power outages to collect food and hot drinks, and recharge cellphones.\n\nThe southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia was hit by more than a dozen missile strikes, according to Oleksandr Starukh, chief of the regional military administration, but it was unclear what had been targeted.\n\nMeanwhile, artillery and rocket attacks continued in the southern city of Kherson, which was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November, targeting critical infrastructure, residential buildings, medical aid and public transport, leaving four dead, according to the head of the regions military administration. Shelling also set a multi-storey apartment building ablaze, and the body of a man was found in one apartment, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-Generals Office said. The city is still struggling to restore basic services.\n\nSections of the Ukrainian railway system in Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk region were out of power following the strikes, and back-up diesel locomotives were replacing some services. Ukraines energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said that nine power-generating facitilites were damaged in Fridays attacks, and warned of more emergency blackouts.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a Ukrainian research and consulting company, said on Ukrainian TV that power outages had been rolled out prior to the strikes as a preventative measure to protect the grid from blackouts. He added that, in spite of this, the result of the attacks Friday morning would be \"unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we already see that they (Russians) are striking at the generating facilities again, trying to cut off our nuclear and thermal power plants, to damage additional key energy hubs, focusing their attacks on these facilities,\" Kharchenko said. \"I urge Ukrainians to understand that the situation is difficult, I urge them to be as prepared as possible for the fact that there will be no quick improvement in the situation with electricity.\"\n\nPolice and investigators inspect a crater at a site of an industrial area destroyed by a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv. Stinger/Reuters\n\nUkraines Armed Forces said Russia pounded the country with 76 missiles, launching cruise missiles from its fleets in the Black and Caspian Seas, and, for the first time, from Tu-95 strategic bombers at the Engels air base, on the Volga River in southern Russia.\n\nThe Engels air base, which is home to Russias long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, was targeted in a drone attack in early December, according to the Kremlin, slightly damaging two planes. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn MiG-31K, a supersonic aircraft capable of carrying a Kinzal hypersonic missile, was also seen in the sky over Belarus during the air attacks on Friday in Ukraine, according to Ukraines Armed Forces. But it was not clear from their statement whether a Kinzal was used in the attacks.\n\n\"The enemy wanted to massively disperse the attention of air defense,\" a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said. Ukraines top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhny, later said that 60 of the missiles were downed by the countrys air defense forces.\n\nLast Monday, Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraines military intelligence, claimed that Russia had nearly exhausted its arsenal of high-precision weapons, but that it still had enough supplies to inflict harm. He added that Iran has not delivered any ballistic missile to Russia analysis echoed by John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council (NSC).\n\n\"We know that their defense industrial base is being taxed,\" Kirby said of Russia. \"We know theyre having trouble keeping up with that pace. We know that hes (Russian President Vladimir Putins) having trouble replenishing specifically precision guided munitions.\"\n\nCNN is unable to verify the level of Russian missile stocks, which has previously been underestimated by Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the Patriot, the US most advanced ground-based air defense system, to Ukraine, according to two US officials and a senior administration official. Ukraines government has long requested the system to help it defend against repeated Russian missile and drone attacks. It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for members of the North Atlantic Treaty and America (NATO) in eastern Europe.\n\nIn a press briefing on Friday, the White House condemned Russias strikes targeting largely civilian infrastructure. Kirby said that the attacks showed that Moscow was \"again trying to put fear into the hearts of the Ukrainian people and to make it that much harder on them as winter is now upon them.\"\n\nHe declined to announce any details on the next security assistance package for Ukraine, but said that there \"will be another one\" and that additional air defense capabilities should be expected.\n\nThe US and NATO countries have been grappling in recent months with how to help Ukraine defend itself against relentless Russian strikes, which have, according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed about half of the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 70 countries and international organizations pledged more than $1 billion to help repair Ukraines infrastructure. Last week, the Pentagon announced that an additional $275 million in security assistance for Ukraine had been approved, including weapons, artillery rounds and equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defense. In November, the US announced a $53 million package to support repairs to Ukraines power system.\n\nThe \"first tranche\" of the energy-related equipment included in the US package has arrived in Ukraine, Kirby said Friday.",

Thousands rushed to subway stations to seek shelter deep underground.\n\nThudding blasts and gunfire from air-defense systems echoed across the country as authorities on social media reported explosions and missile strikes in Kyiv, the capital, southern Kryvyi Rih, southeastern Zaporizhzhia and northeastern Kharkiv. Air raid alarms sounded across the country, warning of a new barrage of the Russian strikes that have occurred intermittently since mid-October.\n\nUkrainian Air Force spokesman Yurii Inhat told Ukrainian TV that more than 60 missiles had been fired, but it wasnt immediately clear how many missiles the Ukrainian army managed to intercept. Some officials reported success in downing some incoming projectiles.\n\nIhnat said Russian forces had fired cruise missiles from positions in the Black Sea, and used bomber aircraft as part of an effort to \"massively distract the attention of the anti-aircraft defense, keeping it in tension.\"\n\nA day earlier, Russias Foreign Ministry warned that if the United States delivers sophisticated Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, such systems and any crews that accompany them would also be a legitimate target for the Russian military. Washington rejected that threat.\n\nAnalysts have said Russian strikes targeting energy infrastructure have been part of a new strategy to try to freeze Ukrainians into submission after recent battlefield losses by Russian forces. Officials and experts say that has only strengthened the resolve of Ukrainians to face up to Russias invasion, while Moscow tries to buy time for a possible offensive in coming months after the current battlefield stalemate.\n\nIn Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyys hometown, a Russian missile slammed into a residential building and destroyed its entrance. Two people were killed, and at least five others were injured including two children and rushed to hospitals, said regional Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko.\n\nThe southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was struck by about 15 Russian missiles, regional Gov. Oleksandr Starukh said. He did not specify the exact location of the strikes, but said infrastructure had been damaged.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on the Telegram social media app that the city is without electricity. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Syniehubov reported three strikes on the citys critical infrastructure.\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko, a top official in President Volodymyr Zelenskyys office, reported a strike on a residential building in Kryvyi Rih, warning on Telegram: \"There may be people under the rubble.\" Emergency services were on site, he said.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported explosions in at least four districts, urging residents to go to shelters.\n\n\"The attack on the capital continues,\" he wrote on Telegram. Subway services in the capital were suspended, he said, as city residents flocked inside its tunnels to seek shelter.\n\nUkrzaliznytsia, the national railway operator, said power was out in a number of stations in the eastern and central Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, due to damage to the energy infrastructure. But trains continued to run by switching from electric power to steam-engine power, which had been readied as a backup.\n\nIn neighboring Moldova, the state-owned energy company Moldelectrica reported disruptions to its electricity network as a result of Russias strikes on Ukraine, and warned of a \"high risk\" of power outages.\n\nMoldova whose Soviet-era systems remain interconnected with Ukraines has already suffered two massive blackouts in recent months as Russia attacked Ukraines energy grid.\n\nThe previous such round of massive Russian air strikes across the country took place on Dec. 5. Ukrainian authorities have reported some successes in intercepting and downing incoming missiles, rockets and armed drones.",

                "cc_text": "In September, Ukrinform started an expert discussion about the course of the current war by publishing a headline-making article \"Prospects for Running a Military Campaign in 2023: Ukraines perspective\" by Valeriy Zaluzhny and Mykhailo Zabrodskyi. We continued it with Mykhailo Zabrodskyi's notes \"Partial mobilization in the Russian Federation: everything is not so simple\" and the article \"Ukraine needs a long missile arm to make Russias aggression impossible\" by solid-propellant rocket developer Leonid Shyman.\n\nIn November, Mykhailo Zabrodskyi published the article \"Patriotic war. Land military prospects\". And here is the continuation of Mykhailo Zabrodskyis analysis of how we can defeat the enemy in the sky.\n\nThe stunning events of recent months on the front of repelling Russian aggression cause quite a range of different emotions. Quite naturally, the feeling of national pride and firm belief in the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers and the courage of our commanders are predominant among them.\n\nThe situation on front line has stabilized in the northern and northeastern sections, north of the Siverskyi Donets River. Fierce battles are taking place around Bakhmut, where the enemy does not stop trying to make a double tactical envelopment of this important administrative center of Donetsk region. The enemy left the right bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson area. Such significant changes in the drawing of the Line of Contact, first of all - on the southern strategic flank, continue to dictate new approaches both to the assessment of the general situation and to a more detailed prediction of future events in the military confrontation.\n\nPreviously, we considered possible options for new or re-emerging threats and challenges for the country's defense on land. Now our task is to discuss the prospects for the next in order, but not in importance, domain of warfighting - Air Warfare. There is no doubt that airspace remains an integral component of the armed fighting against the Russian Federation and the key to success in repelling full-scale armed aggression. Despite the multiple superiority in combat potential, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were unable to implement it for several reasons. At the same time, the Ukrainian Air Forces are still unable to seize the initiative due to a critical imbalance of capabilities. A balanced and rapid build-up of both the air \"shield\" and the \"sword\" should become one of the key priorities in the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nA brief history of the topic\n\nFor a better understanding of the current situation and the very subject of discussion, it is necessary to refer to the events at the front in late February and spring of the current year.\n\nThe enemy's powerful aviation and missile attack formations, which were concentrated around our borders, were to become the trump card of the invasion forces of the Russian Federation and ensure absolute superiority both in the Air and on the Ground, leveling a certain parity on land.\n\nDespite the well-known uncertainty in the planning of any large-scale action, it would seem that the air part of the \"special military operation\" plan against Ukraine should not particularly concern the Russian command. Indeed, all objective indicators from numerical superiority to the localization and capabilities of the enemy's air attack means and the means of Ukrainian Air Defense precisely indicated this. After all, all the objective indicators of \"military mathematics\" pointed to the undeniable superiority of the Russian Air Forces, both in the quantitative and qualitative ratio in the Airspace in all the main operational directions, and in other \"multiplicative\" components, as in the ability of the aggressor ensure strategic envelopment of the Theater of War and its availability of a powerful and generally modern long-range missile arsenal for various carriers. If we add to them a certain strategic and operational suddenness, the technical characteristics of missiles and aircraft, and considerable experience in preparing and launching missile and air strikes, then the result of a large-scale \"air invasion\" seemed to leave the enemy in no doubt.\n\nEveryone at the front and in the rear remembers the pitiful March and April. From the first days of the large-scale invasion, up to a hundred enemy aircraft and helicopters could be in the sky of Ukraine and in the surrounding areas at the same time. Considering the mass launch of missiles, the number of air targets on the screens and tablets displaying the aerial situation of the aviation and air defense CPs was measured in the hundreds. The number of cruise missiles alone used against Ukraine in the first three days quickly became comparable to their total consumption in operations in Syria. Priority targets are civilian and military objects in the rear. Terrible acquaintances - \"Iskander\", and not so much - \"Caliber\", words that Ukrainians of all professions and age groups quickly learned. Devastating group strikes by Russian Ground Attack and Rotary Wing aviation along the entire Line of Contact from Kherson region to Polissia. Bombardment from an altitude of 6,000-7,000 m, which is unreachable for the means of direct Air Defense cover of the units, even of individual platoon strongholds. A carousel of dozens of Su-24M (Fencer-D) and Su-34 (Fullback) front-line bombers over surrounded Mariupol. Unceasing air alarm sirens over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odesa, and our other cities. Yes, all this and much more will not be forgotten.\n\nAccording to the enemy's plans, during the first one to three days of the strategic Air Offensive Operation, the Ukrainian Air Defense should disappear, and within another week, the remnants of combat aviation. It is quite possible that this is exactly what happened. However, not in reality, but only in the victorious reports of Russian generals who were allegedly sent to Moscow in the first weeks of large-scale aggression. In reality, the Ukrainian Air Defense persevered and desperately continued to resist. Having underestimated the level of its survivability, as well as the stability, courage and stubbornness of our pilots and Air Defense crews the enemy defiantly wrote it off from the calculations. The enemy decided that he had gained dominance in the air and began to fulfill his main task - air support of ground groups. This catastrophic miscalculation for the enemy gave our Air Defense a much-needed break and time to regroup.\n\nAs a result, the number of interceptions of air targets turned out to be unexpectedly high for the enemy, although at the time it was disappointing for us in absolute numbers. It turned out that the \"state-of-the-art\" Russian Fullback and Su-35 (Flanker-+), modernized MiGs, Mi and Ka of various indexes, \"Iskanders\" (SS-26 Stone), \"Calibers\" (SS-N-27 Sizzler) and \"Kha-shkis\", which, according to Putin, are \"unique\", are perfectly defined, engaged and fall burning to the ground. The experience of the Russian decorated aces, which they gained by bombing the defenseless cities and towns of Syria, turned out to be completely useless for the War in Ukraine, and the number of \"those who did not return from a combat mission\" of Russian pilots increased rapidly.\n\nEverything that happened and is happening in the air war on the Russian side is now dictated not by design, but exclusively by reaction to the development of events. The transition to missile terror tactics, an increase in the share of fate in the missile strikes of the \"not new\" Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-59 (AS-13 Kingbolt) air-based cruise missiles, the use of the S-300 (SA-10 Grumble) Air Defense system against ground targets, the humiliating purchase of kamikaze drones from Iran and their widespread use by the \"superpower\" against civilian infrastructure is far from a complete list of the Russian Federation's desperate attempts to change the course of events and intercept the strategic air initiative. The decision of the Russian Command regarding the use of air attack means, depending on the orientation of the experts, can be called \"flexible\", \"adaptive, or \"creative\". However, in essence, and this is the most important thing, they are situational. The planned Russian Strategic Air Offensive, which was supposed to clear the way for the land operational groups of the invading troops and quickly force the population of Ukraine to stop resisting, failed.\n\nAt the same time, the relative parity with the enemy in the Air, achieved at a heavy price, is shaky and unstable, and the situation with countering missile terror of the Russian Federation, unfortunately, is far from controlled. The enemy's airstrikes on energy supply facilities have devastating consequences for millions of our compatriots and the national economy. Civilians continue to die from aerial attacks and the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer losses. The enemy's group bombing airstrikes are becoming a thing of the past, but the use of cruise missiles and attack UAVs still pose a mortal danger. At the same time, we must understand that what is happening is significantly different from what should have happened, according to the plans of the Russian Command, even more than six months ago.\n\nSearch for probable causes\n\nLet us consider the objectively probable reasons for the failure of the Russian Air Offensive. More precisely, the question can be narrowed down to a more professional one: what are the reasons for the enemy's non-realization of its combat potential and quantitative and qualitative superiority in the means of warfighting in the Airspace? Advantage can be considered as a double category objective-physical (capabilities available at a certain moment) and subjective-mental (ability to use/implement them with maximum efficiency).\n\nIt is necessary to start with the well-known quantitative and qualitative component of the Air Forces of the Russian Federation, which, obviously, turned out to be somewhat overestimated. The number of Russian combat aircraft in the air group of the invasion, indicated in the estimates of past years, traditionally impressed all experts with three-digit figures and led to a catastrophic calculation ratio for Ukraine [Numerical indicators of the initial quantitative and qualitative ratio of the parties' forces currently remain a subject of debate. Depending on the \"age\" and \"nationality\" of the calculation method used, ratios from 1:7 to 1:30 or more in favor of the enemy are noted.]\n\nAccording to experts, the Russian Federation was and, in principle, remains one of the few countries in the world that has offensive capabilities in airspace. Only the aviation component along our borders, created on the eve of the invasion, consisted of almost half a thousand combat aircraft and several hundred helicopters. It is quite possible that the data were completely adequate if we take as a basis the List of the Numerical Composition of aircraft and helicopters. It should be added that as of February of this year, only the mentioned powerful formation of the Air Force of the Russian Federation in terms of the number of combat aircraft outnumbered the listed aviation fleet of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by approximately four times.\n\nAt the same time, the basis of the Russian formation was precisely modern models of aviation equipment, such as the Flanker-+, Fullback, Su-30 (Flanker-C), Ka-52 (Hokum B), Mi-28 (Havoc), etc. Aircraft and helicopters of early modifications began to be used only later, after incurring irreparable losses in modern models. At the same time, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was armed with physically and morally obsolete samples of aviation equipment and anti-aircraft missile systems of Soviet production, which had long since exhausted their intended resource and had not undergone any significant modernization.\n\nHowever, the course of the first days of the invasion demonstrated that the \"mathematical equations\" of war have too many unknown members that can radically change the outcome. This \"known unknowns\" include such factors as: the narrow specialization of the aviation fleet of the Air Force of the Russian Federation preserved from Soviet practice, the unsatisfactory organization of the overall support of aviation combat operations, the technical imperfection of the critical nomenclature of aviation means of engagement, gaps in the combat, moral and psychological training of the flight crews, unsatisfactory level of the operational Command and Control.\n\nThe imperfections of Russian aviation equipment and weapon need an explanation. Soviet and Russian schools of military aircraft construction occupied leading positions in the world until the last years of the previous century. The appearance of MiG-29 (Fulcrum) and Su-27 (Flanker-B) combat aircraft with their innovative technical solutions caused deep concern in NATO countries. However, the decade of stagnation of Russian industry after the collapse of the USSR and the rapid development of the aviation industry in the West quickly changed the situation to the opposite. The West followed the path of creating multifunctional aviation platforms, while the tradition of the generic division of aviation continued to be preserved in the Russian Air Force. Even their most modern aircraft, pathetically called \"multi-functional\", keep the division according to the main and auxiliary functionality. In military language, they are called the primarily and secondary missions. So, the Fullback is still a front-line bomber with limited air combat capabilities, while the Flanker-C remains primarily a fighter.\n\nWhy is this important? Everything is quite simple. Despite all the dynamics of the Air Warfare, it is linear in the order of execution of combat missions. First - the struggle for superiority in the Air, the destruction of the Command and Control, reconnaissance of the airspace, air defense systems, and combat aviation of the enemy. Then - the execution of missions of airborne landings, isolation of the areas from the air, direct air support of the troops. And finally, launching missile-bomb strikes at strategic depth to disrupt the mobilization of the troops and the economy.\n\nIn practice, if the \"narrow\" specialization of aviation equipment is preserved, while fighters are fighting fierce battles for Air Superiority, ground attack aircraft and bombers will stand idle on airfields, waiting for their time, and vice versa. At the same time, if you are armed with truly multifunctional equipment, you can provide the same capabilities with much smaller forces, changing only the configuration of the air weapon depending on the tasks of the flight mission. That is, despite the significant quantitative indicators of the Russian invasion aviation group, the Ukrainian Air Defense had to deal with only about a third of its number at the same time.\n\nSimilarly, the philosophy of technical solutions embedded in Russian aviation assets of engagement had a negative effect on the course of combat in the Air for the Russian Air Force. For example, anti-radiation missile missiles are the main means of air defense suppression [An anti-radiation missile (ARM) is a missile designed to detect and home in on an enemy radio emission source. It has been widely used, in particular against SAMs, since the sixties of the 20th century.]\n\nRussian ARM of the X-58 (AS-11 Kilter) type (and others) have quite complex tactics of use. To successfully guide the missile to the target, the pilot must engage in a duel with the anti-aircraft missile system operators and for a long time, in fact, in \"kamikaze\" style, conduct a \"frontal attack\" on the SA missile launcher position. To increase their chances, the enemy engages entire units of \"hunter planes\" with a clear division of functions in the \"flock\". But all of this requires pilots to be highly professional, organized, willing to take risks, and self-sacrificing. Everything that Russian pilots lack so much, judging by the fact that there are very few cases of effective suppression of our Ukrainian SAMs, and Russian pilots preferred to kill the civilian population of our cities. At the same time, the AGM-88 HARM ARM (and other modern world aviation weapons), which the Ukrainian aviation has successfully adapted, has a completely different philosophy. An aircraft is often just a carrier platform. Although the pilot can independently select and attack the target, his main task is only to bring the missile to the launch point. The missile can independently search for a target in a defined area, or it can be targeted by another aircraft or a combat control post. Therefore, the numerous modern, or rather \"new\", Russian aviation equipment and means of engagement adhere to the outdated philosophy of air warfare and proved unable to defeat the few, technically outdated, but mentally innovative Ukrainian Air Defense and aviation, supported by Western partners.\n\nAnother likely factor in the failures of Russian aviation is the weak level of comprehensive support for aviation combat operations. Numerous Russian experiments in previous years regarding the transfer of aviation groups to the system of air bases and again to regiments and divisions obviously had a negative impact on the general level of combat readiness and the ability to conduct long-term combat operations away from the home air bases. It is indicative of the fact that at 5-7 main air bases and a dozen operational airfields located around the Ukrainian borders, as well as in Crimea and on the territory of the Republic of Belarus, and which are used by the Russian Air Force to carry out airstrikes, already in the spring it was difficult to notice cases of basing on one airfield more than 14...18 attack aircraft. We can also mention the alleged heart-breaking plan of the Russian Aviation Commanders with the aim of misleading and dispersing the efforts of the Ukrainian Air Defense and any other higher meaning. The explanation of these two features is quite simple. It sounds so familiar - technical serviceability.\n\nIn military practice, the mentioned looks approximately as follows. On the eve of the invasion, the mixed aviation regiment from the 2nd Mixed Aviation Division of the 14th Army of the Air Force and Air Defense, which is stationed in the Chelyabinsk region and is armed with 24 Fullbacks, receives a task to be involved in a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. After overcoming all the accompanying difficulties, 18 fighter-bombers appeared at the Belarusian airfield in February this year. The number 18 in this case is magical and indicative. This is not a squadron, and not two squadrons, and not four or five flight-size units. This is a reality in terms of technical condition, or rather 75% of the total number of bombers in the regiment. The indicator is on the verge of limited combat capability. The hostilities have not yet begun, and a quarter of the aircraft are already missing. A full-size mixed aviation regiment continues to appear in Russian staff estimates. And this applies to the most modern (more precisely, the newest) Russian fighter-bombers of the 4++ generation, which were adopted only in 2014. It is unlikely that the general situation of technical serviceability for aircraft of much earlier types and series looks better.\n\nThe missile component of the Air Offensive turned out to be quite successful. It would seem that the Russian group and massive missile strikes of the first weeks should quickly lead to the destruction of Ukrainian military stocks and defensive objects. The massiveness and systematicity of missile attacks, in addition to significant material damage, led to the disorganization of everyday life, partial panic, and the appearance of a certain number of our compatriots with a sense of the inevitability of disaster.\n\nQuantitative indicators again played a significant role in this. During the first two, the most difficult, months of the large-scale invasion, the average number of enemy missile strikes alone was about 8-10 per day, with an average daily expenditure of up to 15 cruise and ballistic missiles. In addition, the consumption of SS-26 on the first day of the invasion reached a level that later became unattainable for the enemy. More than 80% of the means of air attack consisted of Russian SS-26 and SS-N-27 - ground and sea-based missiles. Even without considering the Russian bet on the rapid advance of ground troops, such devastating air attacks by SS-26 and SS-N-27 should quickly suppress any will of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the civilian population to organized resistance. Skillful use by the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the significantly limited number of available SAMs and fighter aircraft, combined with measures to disperse, camouflage, and direct Air Defense cover objects and troops, did not allow the enemy to achieve what he intended. Despite the technical imperfection and the minimal experience of using the means of Ukrainian Air Defense before the start of a large-scale invasion, its actions quite surprised the Russian theoreticians who support missile terror and self-sufficiency of the Air Offensive. One of the clear confirmations of this is the subsequent transfer of airstrikes by the enemy specifically to the infrastructure facilities of Ukraine with the aim of creating an extremely complicated economic situation in the country, in particular - in the energy sector, and with the expectation of a long-lasting destructive effect.\n\nUndoubtedly, the human factor is extremely important, if not decisive. We can mention the inability of the Russian Air Force to ensure the safety of the use of aviation from operational airfields. Dozens of charred remains of helicopters and airplanes at the airfields in Chornobayivka or Saki can only be explained by the recklessness and neglect of basic safety rules by the relevant officials. We are also talking about the crews of aircrafts, ships, and missile complexes. We will immediately exclude from the scope of consideration that category of personnel who do not personally expose themselves to danger when using their weapons system. These are the crews of the Tu-22M3 (Backfire) long-range bombers, which strike with impunity from the airspace of the Republic of Belarus or the Russian Federation, the missile-carrying ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla, and the crews of the SS-26 mobile short-range ballistic missile system, which conduct launches from extreme ranges. A completely separate set of professional qualities is needed by pilots of fighter, bomber, and attack aircraft, not to mention the crews of rotary wing aviation.\n\nObviously, the enemy had and continues to have the biggest problems with this category of personnel. The conditions for carrying out tasks on training airfields and in the skies of Syria or the Caucasus were significantly different from Ukrainian realities. And where personal training and fighting qualities should have been most fully manifested, difficulties began there. Charged flight hours and unwillingness to risk one's own life, self-confidence and unpaid housing mortgages, ignorance of the theater of war and the degree of real threat from the Ukrainian Air Defense - everything can be found in the interrogation protocols of Russian pilots who were lucky enough to be captured.\n\nThe assignment of combat tasks to only a narrow circle of the most experienced pilots from the number of pilots released into the reserve or the command staff of aviation units turned out to be a temporary solution. However, the ratio of one \"trained\" to twenty-thirty \"inexperienced\" was clearly not in favor of solving the problem. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, it was also common to send various types of \"operational groups\" of pilots from aviation units and formations, on average up to 30% of the flight crew, to carry out \"special military operation\" tasks. Regardless of the name, such groups of pilots were essentially appointed \"from all those who are capable of something.\" In addition, pilot training takes years, not weeks.\n\nThis cannot be considered absolutely typical. The enemy continues to have enough conditionally trained flight personnel, learns in this war together with us and gains combat experience. The level of professional training of its individual \"specialists\" is much higher than we would like. However, we are talking about the realization of the potential, about mass and quantitative indicators, and in this sense, the situation with the enemy's aviators can hardly be called satisfactory.\n\nAlso, judging by the development of the situation, the \"human factor\" was most fully revealed in the work of the C2 bodies of the air component of the aggressor. The very operational construction of an aviation group on the eve of the invasion did not contribute to ensuring controllability. The \"collective hodgepodge\" of aviation units and units from different military districts, their location on several dozen airfields, unresolved problems of interaction and coordination - all these added problems in the organization of combat employment. And most importantly, strategic miscalculations at the planning stage, lack of understanding of the enemy and the development of the situation, and the inability to quickly adapt to these changes led to the failure of the Russian strategic offensive air operation.\n\nBut, let us be honest, despite all the above, the Russian Federation had and still maintains a significant advantage in terms of potential over the Ukrainian Air Defense and aviation. The \"math of war\" still demonstrates that we should have lost the battle for our airspace. And in fact, the only reason, apart from the courage and heroism of our soldiers, thanks to which we managed to withstand past airstrikes and eliminate this advantage is the absolute superiority over the enemy in the work of our C2 bodies.\n\nObjectively about what has been known for a long time\n\nThe review will remain incomplete without indicating the factors that significantly contributed and continue to contribute to the enemy's performance of the Air Warfare tasks. They can be conditionally divided into two groups: situational and those that operate constantly.\n\nAbsolute similarity and good familiarity of the enemy with the fleet of aircraft and anti-aircraft means of the domestic Air Force have a significant negative impact. Long-term operation and use of practically identical models provides an opportunity to thoroughly study all the features of their combat use and \"weak spots\" in technical characteristics. This allows the enemy to build tactics of using their own air attack means, using the well-known weaknesses of our air defense system, and, if possible, to neutralize the strong ones. This is manifested in the construction of air and missile strikes, selected routes, and flight profiles on various segments of the trajectory to increase the probability of a breakthrough of the Air Defense. In turn, this forces our air defense and combat aviation to constant maneuvers, changes in work modes and extensive use of the remaining resource of air defense systems.\n\nThe frank technical obsolescence of air defense equipment, most of which are developments of 50-60 years ago, in particular air defense systems, does not allow to effectively engage certain types of air targets. First of all, this applies to small objects, ballistic targets, and hypersonic air-launched missiles. But not only SS-26 and SS-N-27 are an undeniable threat. Missiles of the X-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) or P-800 \"Onyx\" (SS-N-26 Strobile) type are also extremely difficult targets for our Air Defense to intercept. Theoretically, the SA-10 anti-aircraft missile systems could engage them, but Ukraine does not have the appropriate anti-missiles for them.\n\nFor the planes of our tactical aviation, for example, the lack of an active jamming station, which should act on the main element of modern radars - the monopulse direction finder, is fatal. In addition, the planes of our tactical aviation do not have effective on-board EW complexes capable of protecting them from the enemy SA/AA missiles. Moreover, given the enemy's use of Pantsir S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) mobile air defense systems, combat flight missions in the area of the Line of Contact are always associated with significant danger, since regular airborne radiation warning stations are unable to detect the radar operations of this air defense system.\n\nNot the last role is played by technical wear and tear, losses, damages and, as a derivative of them, the unsatisfactory level of technical readiness of air defense equipment and aircraft.\n\nThere remains a group of constantly acting factors. The most significant among them is the numerical superiority of the means of air attack, beyond which even the tactical and technical characteristics of the models cease to play a decisive role. In other words: it is the banal insufficient number of air defense systems and fighter aircraft that has an effect. This is especially critical when repelling group and massive enemy missile strikes. Let us not forget about the usual limitations in the available stocks of SA missiles for the old park's Air Defense systems.\n\nFor long-term planning, it is important to understand the currently existing disproportion between the number of cover objects and the number of Air Defense assets, taking into account losses. Former calculation methods no longer provide the possibility of estimating quantitative indicators for means of air cover. The reason for this lies in the different level of development of military technologies and the degree of branching of the infrastructure that ensures the functioning of the state and the well-being of citizens. The experience of the War, the selectivity and targeting of the enemy's use of air attack force a revision of the existing calculation norms for the number of anti-aircraft weapons and stocks of SA missiles.\n\nThe existing numerical composition of forces and means of air defense physically does not allow to create an echeloned Air Defense over the entire territory of the country. Currently, we have limited capabilities to effectively intercept ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and attack UAVs. At one time, the architecture of our Air Defense system was mainly built in Soviet times and was intended to combat aircraft at low altitudes and above. And it successfully completed this task. But most cruise missiles and attack UAVs on the route fly at extremely low altitudes of 50...150 m. In this altitude echelon, the available SA missile systems can cover a small part of the country's territory. That is why when we note the interception of 70...90% of the enemy's missiles, it should be attributed only to the skill of the personnel of our Air Force.\n\nThe drawing of state borders with the Russian Federation and Belarus, which covers the territory of our state and the coastal strategic southern flank, also refers to constantly acting factors. The use of the water area of the Black Sea, the airspace and the territory of the Republic of Belarus allows the enemy to increase the total front of the likely directions of airstrikes by almost three times. And since the summer of this year, the \"emphasis\" on the use of air- and sea-based cruise missiles by the Russians, in addition to being an objective indicator of their stockpiles, also has considerable operational significance.\n\nIt is impossible to deny the enemy the skillful use of two such familiar, but difficult to predict in the pre-war period, components of military confrontation in the Air Warfare.\n\nOne of them is the use of airborne early warning and control aircraft of the Beriev A-50 (Mainstay) type and its modifications. This allows the enemy to control the air situation hundreds of kilometers deep into the territory that is on our side of the Line of Contact. This is especially critical for monitoring the actions of our fighter and bomber aircraft. Individual cases of interception of our aircraft in the depths of our territory with the help of long-range missiles of the AA type by targeting from the Mainstay have already been noted. At the same time, the detection range of domestic Air Defense means is practically determined by the characteristics of the spread of radio waves in the meter and centimeter bands.\n\nAnother was the widespread use by the enemy of radio-electronic suppression of anti-aircraft weapons in view of the weak protection of our Air Defense systems from its influence. It is noteworthy that for the performance of these missions, means of not the newest Russian models are involved, and the reason for their effectiveness lies exclusively in the technical imperfection of domestic Air Defense equipment.\n\nWhy the Air again?\n\nRussia's by no means limitless stocks of cruise missiles of the SS-26 family and the minimal possibilities for their production in the face of sanctions pressure force the Russians to look for other, more affordable means of destruction to accomplish their tasks. The first such step was the transition to the widespread use of attack UAVs of the Shahed family. The next step, which is already being observed, is the transfer of the bulk of strike tasks to air-based cruise missiles. At the same time, given the limited stocks of SS-26-type cruise missiles, their use in the medium term will become more selective and is expected to target HVTs.\n\nIn the future, considering the effectiveness of missile weapons systems, which use a ballistic trajectory or a ballistic descent on the final part of the trajectory, the most probable is the expansion of the scope of their employment. In this situation, the advanced Iranian replicas of the Soviet-Chinese Fateh-110 ballistic missiles and their improved Zolfaghar version, the possibility of supplying which to the Russian Federation was noted as recently as two months ago, pose a mortal danger to facilities throughout the territory of our country. The characteristics of range and accuracy, as well as the natural technical complexity of intercepting a ballistic target and the limitations of Ukraine in the necessary means encourage the enemy to consider just such an option.\n\nThe situation with the organization of the operation of aviation equipment in the Russian Armed Forces is unlikely to improve for a few reasons, but the enemy still can maintain and expand the aviation group due to its impressive numbers. Russia continues to transfer aviation equipment from the \"rear\" military districts to replenish the losses incurred and still has enough resources to conduct the battle in the Airspace at the current intensity for several years to come. The fact that the number of the aviation group around Ukraine has remained almost unchanged since the beginning of the invasion, however, its qualitative composition has significantly deteriorated, as the Russian side is forced to replace modern lost aircraft and helicopters with outdated modifications, sometimes even removed from storage, is indicative.\n\nThe situation with strategic aviation, in particular with the fleet of Backfire and Tu-95MS (Bear-H) missile-carrying bombers, does not seem to worry the Russian Command, because there are no losses in the air among these aircraft. At the same time, the listed number of fighter-bombers Flanker-C, fighters Fullbacks and Flanker-+ - the main models of strike aircraft of the Russian Air Force, still makes it possible to easily replenish losses of aviation equipment. Considering the crucial importance of the use of air attack means, the command of the Russian Armed Forces seems to be ready to take exactly such measures, sometimes even giving in to the need to maintain the balance of the air presence in other regions.\n\nRussian stocks of air-launched cruise missiles, especially modern ones, like any military stocks, are not unlimited. However, there is no reason for optimism in this. Simply waiting and hoping that the airstrikes will cease due to the enemy's lack of weapons is the worst thing that can be done in the current situation. To the simple question: when this can happen, there is an equally simple answer - never. It is safe to say that the Russian leadership has been busy searching for a way out of this situation for more than a month. And certain solutions are already being implemented. One of them is based on the relative availability of air and missile armaments for external supply. Monetary costs or obligations to partners can eliminate for the Russian Federation problems associated with continuing the design or increasing the production of air attack weapon. To some extent, this situation is somewhat like the Ukrainian one, when we do not have a particular choice, but must accept as help what our partners offer or can afford to offer.\n\nThe winter period to some extent complicates the rapid maneuver of air defense assets. Note that in conditions of numerical superiority of air attack means over anti-aircraft means, such a maneuver is the key to successful countermeasures.\n\nA decrease in the dynamics of the actions of ground troops will probably lead to relative stabilization along the entire length of the Line of Contact. Under the condition of effective use of reconnaissance means, the possibility of detecting and hitting targets increases due to the decrease in their degree of mobility. The location and configuration of the air defense system are becoming more fixed and predictable. This opens certain opportunities for the enemy to plan to successfully overcome zonal air defense on the Line of Contact, which means the possibility of returning to the wide use of strike aircraft against objects in the operational rear and in the depths of the country's territory.\n\nFocusing on air attacks makes it possible not to reduce the intensity of hostilities not only on the front, but also throughout the country, regardless of the probable maneuvers of groups of land troops. For civil infrastructure, first of all - for energy facilities, failure in the cold period of the year is more painful and requires incomparably greater efforts to restore. There is no need to talk about the fact that the country's energy system is already teetering on a dangerous edge. In addition, the critical infrastructure of our country is not limited exclusively by energy facilities.\n\nThe purely military purpose of continuing and escalating airstrikes on objects in our rear can be disruption of the planned training of troops, restoration of combat capability, supply of new types of weapons and military equipment. It means that the targets of airstrikes can again be military training areas, supply bases, storage sites, and defense industrial facilities.\n\nAnd subsequently, the focus on airstrikes preserves the possibility of speculation and political pressure on the country's leadership and the international community by exploiting the reality of a regional energy disaster. To some in the leadership of the Russian Federation, the above seems to be the key to the successful completion of the \"special military operation\" and victory over Ukraine. Such plans are not only another reason to assert their reckless nature and lack of prospects, but also to emphasize the seriousness of the enemy's further intentions.\n\nThere will be a continuation\n\nIt should be noted once again that the enemy is also conducting a further search for ways to realize the potential of air superiority. And a number of the mentioned problematic issues, or even a wider list of them, are of no less concern to the Russian command than to us. It is only logical that we should expect to improve existing or introduce new steps and evaluate innovative approaches to Air Warfare. At least three such possibilities are seen today.\n\nAttacks by enemy UAVs, primarily on infrastructure facilities, will continue. If we take the observation of September-November as a basis, then the available and declared for delivery under Iranian contracts may be enough for another two or three months. It is possible to build up Russian production and expand the range of UASs that will be used. During this time, with effective planning of airstrikes, it can cause severe damage to our civilian facilities and industry. In addition, the goal of massive UAV attacks will remain the exhaustion of the Air Defense system and the forcing of excessive use of SA missiles. Despite the high percentage of interception, given the cost of SA missiles and the moral and economic consequences of strikes, UAVs will remain one of the main types of Air Warfare weapons. Soon, creative options for complex UAV and cruise missile strikes or duplicating the engagement of HVTs will begin to appear.\n\nThe enemy will try to get the maximum benefit from the technical complexity of intercepting ballistic targets. It is likely to increase the strikes by means of air attack that reveal themselves to be ballistic targets for our air defense, for example Zolfaghar ballistic missiles with a flight range of up to 700 km declared by the manufacturer. Further \"background\" use by the enemy of cruise missiles, or even outdated \"Tochka-U\" (SS-21 Scarab A) to complicate the construction of missile strikes and overload Ukrainian air defense, is not excluded.\n\nThe above in no way precludes the continued selective use of SS-26 and SS-N-27 cruise missiles against the most important targets in our rear. Selectivity will be determined by the number of missiles, which will remain limited due to difficulties with production, and more precisely, with the supply of components under international sanctions pressure.\n\nTasks for today for a successful tomorrow\n\nAsking questions is usually much easier than offering answers to them. War in the air has always been a devastating combination of measures to cover one's own troops and objects from airstrikes while simultaneously inflicting maximum damage on the enemy. Such an exquisite dance with aerial \"shield and sword\" is known to everyone, and especially to military professionals, since the times of the wars of the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen considering an air \"shield\" for Ukraine, it is necessary to start with solving the problem of acquisition air targets, because \"seeing\", especially in relation to cruise missiles, attack, bomber aircraft and attack UAVs, is very often much more difficult than hitting. Today, such a task is solved by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by skillful maneuvering of detection means to constantly put the enemy in front of a new configuration of the radar field, for which he again needs time and resources. However, this approach is more typical for covering groups of troops than rear-line objects, and it is used in a certain forced manner. The ideal option would be to build a continuous radar field covering the entire altitude echelon, including extremely low ones. It is not cheap and not soon, but such a goal should be set. And no funds should prevent the reliable protection of the lives of civilians in the rear and military personnel on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that economic losses from airstrikes can exaggerate the specified costs by an order of magnitude.\n\nIn addition, the capabilities of detecting air targets and targeting interceptors can be provided by air situation control systems that implement the NATO standard for information exchange Link-16. The production and improvement of the domestic model of such a system - \"Oreanda-PS\" has been going on for more than a year. At the same time, an immediate solution may be the supply of such systems from abroad. It is important that our partners also understand the need for such a \"hot\" solution. In particular, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, US Army General Mark Milley, noted in October of this year that \"...whatever systems will be delivered to Ukraine as a result, they will be combined into one joint structure, in which the exchange of information will be ensured\".\n\nAhead is joint systematic work with partners to re-equip the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with anti-aircraft missile systems. Despite the similar need for immediate decisions, since the threat of enemy airstrikes is daily, it is necessary to consider two essential factors. First, it is the presence of objective opportunities and political will of our partners. Unfortunately, anti-aircraft missile systems are not among the types of weapons that can be stored at arsenals for decades, so their \"stockpiles\" are extremely small. An exception can be made only by air defense systems of earlier types, or those stored as reserves. It means that any decision on the transfer of air defense systems to Ukraine is made and will be made by any country, first, to the detriment of its own security. In addition, Ukraine is currently not in a position to refuse foreign aid or to put forward its own conditions. Secondly, it is critically important to prevent the formation and accumulation in the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of a diverse \"zoo\" of heterogeneous air defense systems of foreign production. Of course, we should not forget about the standardization and interoperability of almost all types of similar weapons among NATO countries and outside the Alliance. However, we must remember that the real or potential threat of Russian airstrikes unfortunately will not disappear either tomorrow or even after the end of the War. The use and operation of heterogeneous systems of high-tech weapons such as air defense systems has always been and will remain a serious challenge for a long time. That is why the future architecture of the domestic Air Defense system, as far as air defense assets are concerned, should already be clearly formed, agreed upon and accepted for implementation by us and our partners.\n\nToday, there is a clear need to equip the Air Force of Ukraine with air defense systems of three classes in terms of the range of hitting air targets: short range - up to 40 km; medium range - up to 100 km; long-range - more than 100 km [The classification by range is given in accordance with the one adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the widespread world standards for the classification of air defense systems provides for a short range - up to 40 km; average range - up to 80 km; long-range complexes - up to 150 km and more.]\n\nModern calculations show that the need for air defense systems of the specified classes is about two-thirds, less than a third and 8...10%, respectively. The filling of such a structure with the corresponding material parts has already begun. For example, the IRIS-T SL air defense system developed under the leadership of German specialists, the American MIM-23 Hawk family, and the Norwegian-American NASAMS 2 in their current configurations are typical representatives of the short-range air defense system class to replace the Soviet Buk-M1 (SA-17 Grizzly). Next should be the filling of the medium-range air defense system component to replace the SA-10 air defense system. Such a complex for the Ukrainian Air Force in the near future may be the French SAMP/T with a stated range of up to 100 km and the ability to intercept ballistic targets or the Israeli Barak-8 with a stated range of up to 90 km. The use of the American MIM-104 Patriot in the modification of the PAC-3 will also provide serious advantages. In the future, as a long-range air defense system, provided that the partners make appropriate decisions, it is possible to use, for example, the American THAAD.\n\nAt the same time, these medium-range and long-range air defense systems will make it possible to fill the gaps in the capabilities of the national Air Defense to combat ballistic targets. It should be noted that the traditional continuity and unification of most models of foreign armaments of Air Defense forces allow only by changing the equipment and nomenclature of SA missiles to significantly expand the capabilities of the complex itself. So, for example, the more advanced NASAMS-3, subject to the use of certain types of missiles from the AIM-120 line, is already considered a medium-range air defense system. The technical capabilities of the main Soviet medium-range SA-10 for the Ukrainian Air Force have not been fully exhausted. So, for example, when using the \"long-range\" SA missile 9M83M, the not new SA-10 becomes a long-range complex.\n\nThe priority tasks of aviation are and will remain ensuring superiority in the Air and improving capabilities for the air strikes. According to the assessments of domestic experts, objectively, the issue of maintaining the existing aircraft fleet does not arise before the Ukrainian Air Force as such. As is well known, our aviation \"squeezes\" the necessary resource from the available fleet beyond any regulations and safety margins. And if in the conditions of a full-scale war it is quite possible, then after its end, most of the aviation equipment will likely to be decommissioned. In addition, this fact also rejects the possibility of further modernization, which in the absolute majority of cases loses its meaning if the aircraft platform is physically worn out.\n\nIt remains to purchase or supply with material and technical assistance. But this is traditionally a long and financially burdensome option. As in the case of anti-aircraft missile systems, the world market for combat aircraft is quite limited. The production cycle takes months, if not years, and the queue for the purchase of basic models of modern multi-purpose fighters is drawn up for years. In addition, the issue of the sale of combat aircraft has always been politicized, and therefore requires a certain consensus between the manufacturer and the government of the country concerned. Even if you look at the used equipment market, it is just as limited. Just as there is a queue at the manufacturer's factories, there is no less a queue of people wishing to buy \"second-hand\" aircraft on the secondary market. Only a few countries have significant stockpiles of aviation equipment in storage, such as the United States, but given their own ambitions and the growing risks of global confrontation, they are also reluctant to consider the transfer of this important mobilization resource. In addition, all equipment on the secondary market (either from storage or from military units after rearmament) will require at least major repairs or even modernization. And this also requires time and financial costs.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that work with partners should not be conducted. Already now it is necessary to conduct negotiations on aviation \"lend-lease\". These can be multipurpose fighters of the F-16 type Block 50/52 or even Block 40/42 from storage bases or decommissioned after the rearmament of military units (as the most likely option in the near future). And even if these are not the latest versions, they still outperform the Soviet MiGs in terms of their tactical and technical characteristics, they will help compensate for the losses suffered by our aviation and gain the necessary experience in the operation of Western aviation equipment. It must be considered that they are likely to become consumables in our war, so now it does not make sense to seek to get aircraft \"off the assembly line\". In the future, it is necessary to focus efforts on obtaining more modern types of aircraft: the same F-16, but already in the Block 70/72 modification, F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, Swedish JAS 39E/F Grippen, or even F -35. However, as in the case of SA missile, based on several reasons, it is desirable to preserve the maximum uniformity of the line of aviation equipment.\n\nAs with SAM, the decisions made are likely to be decisive for a sufficiently extended period. The \"trial and error\" method, given the criticality of the situation and limited financial resources, is unlikely to work. Practically, it means that stopping at one of the options or their combination will determine the prospects for the development and equipment of combat aviation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for years and decades.\n\nThe aerial \"sword\" should be combined strikes against the stationary targets of the enemy, first against the airfields of the base of the Russian strike aircraft and the areas of the launch positions of ballistic and cruise missiles. This will enable the Air Force and the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole to move from repelling airstrikes to retaliatory strikes, as well as preventive targeted strikes. Based on the actual and probable placement of this type of targets, there is an urgent need for means of destruction capable of hitting targets of the specified type in the territory controlled by the enemy at least to a depth of 150...250 km. Currently, at least two ways of solving this issue are considered. The first should be the expansion of the capabilities of strike aviation due to the use of more advanced models of aviation and missile weapons. The second is to increase the range of the M-142 HIMARS complexes equipped with ATACMS missiles. Successful combined strikes at a limited depth have already entered the practice of combat work of the Air Force and missile units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Currently, they are limited only to the technical characteristics of certain types of weapons. The possibility to reach the airfields of the base of strike aircraft and the areas of the starting positions of the enemy's ground-based cruise missiles remains ideal. This ability to \"equalize the range\" immediately transforms the air war for the Russians and their satellite from an exciting adventure with combat launches into a deadly drudgery.\n\nA brief overview of the history, current situation, and probable prospects of confrontation in the Air in the course of repelling large-scale aggression allows us to draw several main conclusions.\n\nThe bet on the air component was, is and will remain one of the main ones in the plans of Russian strategists. This approach allows the enemy to count on obtaining a significant advantage in all key areas of military conflict: from military to political.\n\nDespite a number of significant obstacles, the search for novel approaches and the enemy's persistence in continuing the Air War by all available means is an objective reality. The likely targets of further air attacks will remain the objects of civil infrastructure, first of all - the energy sector, and the administrative centers of our country.\n\nContinuation of the protection of the airspace and objects of the strategic rear of the state should remain a priority task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The successful completion of such a task is possible only on the condition of adopting and implementing a set of systemic measures to increase the capabilities of countering the enemy in the Air and from the Air.\n\nWe understand it and we can do it.",

All times EST.\n\n11:30 pm.:\n\n11 p.m.: Russian gas exports to Europe via pipelines plummeted to a post-Soviet low in 2022 as its largest customer cut imports because of the conflict in Ukraine and a major pipeline was damaged by mysterious blasts, Gazprom data and Reuters calculations showed.\n\nThe European Union, traditionally Russia's largest consumer for oil and gas, has for years spoken about cutting its reliance on Russian energy, but Brussels got serious after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February.\n\nState-controlled Gazprom, citing Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, a long-standing ally of President Vladimir Putin, said its exports outside of ex-Soviet Union will reach 100.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) this year.\n\nThat is a fall of more than 45% from 185.1 bcm in 2021 and includes supplies to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, through which Gazprom supplied 10.39 bcm last year.\n\nRussian direct gas exports to Germany, Europe's largest economy, were halted in September following blasts at the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea.\n\nSweden and Denmark have both concluded that four leaks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 were caused by explosions but have not said who might be responsible.\n\n10:30 p.m.: Work has begun in the Black Sea port city of Odesa to remove a monument of the Russian 18th-century empress Catherine the Great, often referred to as \"the founder of Odesa,\" from the city center amid Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The move was decided by the Odesa city council on November 30, when local lawmakers also decided to remove a monument of Russian 18th-century general and military commander Aleksandr Suvorov.\n\nWatch a video about the statue by Stuart Greer in Odesa.\n\n9:50 p.m.: President Vladimir Putin has gifted eight golden rings to Moscow-allied leaders of post-Soviet countries, sparking a torrent of jokes and comparisons with power-hungry tyrant Sauron from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nDuring a summit that took place in Saint Petersburg on Monday and Tuesday, the leaders of eight post-Soviet states received golden rings that showcase the emblem of the regional organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and feature the engraved words \"Russia\" and \"Happy New Year 2023.\"\n\nPutin kept the ninth ring for himself.\n\nOf the foreign leaders, only Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko was pictured wearing the present.\n\nSome political commentators such as prominent political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann said the allusion to the epic fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien was intentional.\n\nIn Tolkien's classic, Sauron gives rings to nine kings in order to enslave them and bend them to his will.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was no need to read too much into the meaning of the gifts.\n\n\"It's just a New Year's souvenir, there's nothing special about it,\" he said. Putin will not be wearing his ring, he added.\n\n9 p.m.:\n\n8 p.m.: A U.S. weapon first used in 1999 in Kosovo will soon be used by Ukrainian pilots flying Russian-made jets to kill Russian soldiers, the New York Times reports.\n\nCalled the Joint Direct Attack Munition, it is a kit that turns a cheap, unguided bomb into a highly accurate, GPS-guided weapon a precision-guided bomb that Ukraine has never had before. And it is part of the $1.85 billion in military aid package.\n\nWhen dropped from higher altitudes, the bomb can travel about 15 miles to its target before exploding.\n\n7:22 p.m.: A Swiss court has granted a six-month \"stay of bankruptcy\" to the operating company for the never-opened Nord Stream 2 pipeline, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe pipeline was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but put on ice shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nA regional court in the Swiss canton (state) of Zug extended the stay from Jan. 10 through July 10 by, according to a notice published Wednesday in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\nThe company, Nord Stream 2 AG, is a subsidiary of Russias Gazprom but based in Zug. Its court-appointed administrator had sought the extension. German Chancellor Olaf Scholzs government halted the certification process for the pipeline on February 22.\n\n6:44 p.m.:\n\n6 p.m.: Ship insurers said they are cancelling war risk coverage across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, following an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses, Reuters reported.\n\nReinsurers typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on January 1, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started, after being hit this year by losses related to the conflict and from Hurricane Ian in Florida.\n\nP&I (protection and indemnity) clubs American, North, UK and West are no longer able to offer war risk cover for some liabilities in the region beginning Jan. 1, they said. The clubs are among the biggest P&I insurers who cover around 90% of the worlds ocean-going ships.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology says his country is developing combat drones that attack the ones Russia has used during its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov described Russias war in Ukraine as the first major war of the internet age. He credited drones and satellite internet systems like Elon Musks Starlink with having transformed the conflict.\n\nFedorov says the Ukrainian military so far has used drones mostly for reconnaissance and that strike zones are the next step. The minister also discussed the challenges Ukraine faces in maintaining internet service during the war.\n\n4:12 p.m.: A group of ethnic Chechens fleeing Russia has arrived in Bosnia with hopes of using the Balkan country as a launchpad to reach the European Union and avoid getting sent to fight in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Bosnian Security Ministry said Wednesday that about 50 people, predominantly from Russias Chechnya region, congregated near Bosnias northwestern border with EU-member Croatia. The ministry said the travelers want to reach the EU because they are \"fleeing [to avoid] military draft\" in Russia.\n\nRussians can enter Bosnia without a visa and are permitted to stay in the country for a maximum of 90 days. The ethnic Chechens gathered near the Bosnia-Croatia border include families with children.\n\n3:46 p.m.: Frances defense minister, Sbastien Lecornu, visited Kyiv Wednesday, pledging further military support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. Lecornu met with Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraines defense minister. They discussed Frances \"reliable and lasting support\" to Ukraine and the needs of its military in the next year. Lecornu said the support will include French army equipment and a 200 million euro ($212 million) fund that would allow Ukraine to purchase weapons.\n\nThis is the first time Lecornu has visited Ukraine since Russia invaded the country 10 months ago. Lecornu said his governments backing is unflagging, while efforts are also made with Moscow to reach an eventual negotiated end to Russia's invasion.\n\nLecornu was also due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n2:27 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has delivered his final speech of the year to Ukraine's parliament, reported Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, telling lawmakers that Ukraine is recognized worldwide for its unity and courage in the face of the Russian invasion. Ukraine's national colors \"are the international symbol of courage,\" Zelenskyy said in the speech Wednesday, which was delayed by more than an hour because of an airstrike. \"In any country, in any continent, when you see blue and yellow, you know it's about freedom. About the people who did not surrender, who stood, who united the world, and which will win,\" he said. Zelenskyy said the world had seen that freedom can be triumphant through Ukraine's gains on the battlefield, adding his thanks to all of Ukraine's military. 1:53 p.m.: Germany on Wednesday shrugged off Russia's ban on oil sales to countries and companies that comply with a price cap agreed by Western allies, saying it has \"no practical significance,\" Agence France-Presse reported. \"I would not like to say that it's irrelevant but it has no practical significance,\" said an economy ministry spokeswoman, adding that Germany has been preparing since early summer to do without Russian oil. Berlin has been working to ensure security of supply which \"continues to be assured regardless of whether this decree has been issued or not.\" Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy, but has been forced to wean itself off crude, coal and gas from the power giant after Moscow invaded Ukraine. 1:05 p.m.: Russian forces rained artillery fire on Ukrainian positions along the whole contact line in the east, with a focus on Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, where the heaviest fighting has been taking place over the past months, the General Staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 12:33 p.m.: The number of confirmed civilian casualties from Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing 18,000, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said, according to a report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. From February 24, when Moscow launched its unprovoked invasion, to December 26, there were 17,831 civilian casualties recorded in the country -- 6,884 killed and 10,947 wounded, the OHCHR said in a statement. The agency added that the actual toll was \"considerably higher\" but that getting reliable data from frontline areas was difficult. Among the killed were 429 children, the OHCHR said. 11:47 a.m.: How 'Angel' the Chechen Overcame Ukrainian Suspicions and Joined the Fight Against Russia: \"Angel\" is a Chechen volunteer currently fighting in one of Ukraine's military units. After the Second Chechen War started in 1999, he fled to Ukraine with his family, where he's lived ever since. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, \"Angel\" and his son joined the Ukrainian military and have been fighting on the front lines in the Donbas region. He shared his story with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Yevhenia Nazarova in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya region.\n\n10:50 a.m.: In the Kharkhiv region, it is only now months of intense Russian bombardment down the line that Ukrainian electrical engineers can begin reconnecting the power grid. Agence France-Presse visited a village near the front line where barely a single home was left undamaged during the fighting.\n\nBarely 10 kilometers from the Russian border, these electrical engineers are trying to repair a substation that was damaged in a bombardment.\n\nThis entire zone was on the front line, until the Ukrainian army recaptured it in September. For more than five months, villages here suffered heavy bombardment.\n\n10:07 a.m.: The ruble weakened sharply on Wednesday, sliding to the 72 mark against the dollar, as sanctions on Russian oil and their probable impact on export revenues put pressure on the Russian currency, Reuters reported.\n\nThe ruble lost about 8% against the dollar last week and is on course for a hefty monthly decline after an oil embargo and price cap came into force. The finance ministry has said the recent slump is related to recovering imports.\n\nThe ruble has experienced high volatility in the past two weeks and is liable to sharp swings amid smaller trading volumes in the run up to Russia's New Year holidays.\n\n\"The newly imposed Western sanctions have contributed to the recent falls in energy prices, which is certainly putting pressure on the ruble,\" said Olga Yangol, head of emerging markets research and strategy for Americas at Credit Agricole CIB.\n\n9:32 a.m.: Frances defense minister has arrived in Kyiv to discuss further military support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. French Minister for the Armed Forces Sebastien Lecornu laid a wreath at a heroes monument in Ukraine's capital on Wednesday. He was scheduled to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and army officials. While France has been less vocal about its military support for Ukraine than the United States and Britain, the country has sent a steady supply of weapons since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. Lecornu tweeted that the French governments backing is \"constant\" while efforts are made to reach an eventual negotiated end to the war.\n\n8:40 a.m.: For the paratroopers of a Ukrainian airborne brigade, theres only one way to describe the waves of Russian infantry who are relentlessly pressing the Ukrainian lines in and around this Donbas city: Meat.\n\n\"First, they throw in the mobilized soldiers for certain death, like meat,\" one soldier, who asked not to be identified due to military regulations, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. \"Then, if they break through, the more experienced fighters move in.\"\n\nWith Russians invasion of Ukraine now in its 11th month, the ferocity of the fighting in Kreminna is matched only by the intensity of the fighting 80 kilometers to the south, in the city of Bakhmut.\n\nBut according to interviews with Ukrainian soldiers and accounts published on Russian military blogger accounts on Telegram and elsewhere, the bloodshed is no less senseless and relentless. Its unclear how long it will last, though: One Ukrainian official claims that Kreminna is on the verge of being recaptured by Ukrainian forces.\n\n8:16 a.m.:\n\n7:30 a.m.: Russia's economy contracted by more than 2% over the past 11 months, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said during a televised government meeting on Wednesday.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Air raid sirens sounded across all Ukraine's regions on Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes.\n\nThe capital Kyiv and other regions sounded the all-clear almost two hours later.\n\nUkrainian social media reports said the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off.\n\nReuters was unable to immediately verify that information.\n\n6:50 a.m.: A tip-off from a friendly Western intelligence agency helped Germany identify an employee in its foreign intelligence service (BND) who was arrested on suspicion of passing state secrets to Russia, Reuters reported Wednesday citing the Spiegel magazine.\n\nPolice in December arrested a German citizen identified as Carsten L. in a treason investigation, and searched his home and workplace and those of another person. The Russian embassy has declined comment.\n\nThe German authorities have warned of likely heightened Russian spying given the Kremlin's standoff with the West over its invasion of Ukraine. The German government expelled what it said were 40 Russian spies in April.\n\nCiting people familiar with the investigation, Spiegel reported that a Western intelligence agency had found material in Moscow's possession that came from the BND and contained intelligence on Russia.\n\nThe suspected double agent was the head of a unit in the BND's technical reconnaissance department, Spiegel said.\n\nThe BND and the attorney general's office declined comment.\n\nA government spokesperson also declined comment at a press briefing, saying the government took the matter seriously but it would not divulge details about the investigation in a way that could benefit Russia.\n\n6 a.m.: The head of Russia's state-controlled airline Aeroflot called on the Russian government to \"balance the interests\" of Russian and foreign airlines in order to support the domestic aviation sector, Reuters reported in an interview with Russian news site RBC published on Wednesday.\n\nIn the interview, Aeroflot CEO Sergei Alexandrovsky said it is \"important that the state balances the interests of Russian and international carriers. Because it is obvious that foreign carriers now have much more opportunities and advantages in these conditions.\"\n\nRussian airlines stopped flying to most overseas destinations after Western countries imposed unprecedented sanctions, including bans on Russian carriers, after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24. Routes to Turkey and Middle Eastern countries popular with Russian tourists have been preserved.\n\nAlexandrovsky said that competitors, including Turkish Airlines and Emirates had benefitted most from the situation, and called for a degree of what he called \"state protectionism\" to safeguard domestic aviation.\n\n5:47 a.m.: Russia did not consult with OPEC+ on its response to a Western price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, stating that it was Russia's sovereign right to respond as it sees fit to such \"illegal measures\".\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Tuesday delivered Russia's long-awaited response to the cap, signing a decree that bans the supply of crude oil and oil products from Feb. 1 for five months to nations that abide by it.\n\nPeskov said contacts between Russia and the OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers, which includes Russia, were ongoing on other issues.\n\n5:30 a.m.: According to Reuters, the Kremlin on Wednesday said that peace proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it called \"the new reality\" of four Ukrainian regions having joined Russia.\n\nRussia declared Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia part of its territory in September after referendums condemned by Ukraine and Western countries. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.\n\n5:10 a.m.: In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraines Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, called Russias invasion of Ukraine the first major war of the digital age. Now, technology like drones and satellite internet systems are mentioned in the same breath as traditional tanks, missiles and other weapons.\n\nUkraine has bought more than 1,400 drones and, in the interview, Fedorov discussed where he sees the technology going and how Ukraine plans to outpace Russia in the months ahead.\n\n4:40 a.m.:\n\n4:15 a.m.: One of President Vladimir Putin's most powerful Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine Russia says it has annexed, Reuters cited a Moscow-installed official in the region as saying.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia's domestic politics and a former head of the country's state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed local official.\n\n\"Sergei Kiriyenko visited the nuclear power plant he checked the safety of the facility and the working conditions of Rosatom employees,\" Rogov said on Telegram.\n\nIn a picture published by Rogov, Kiriyenko was shown outside the plant, which lies just 500 km (300 miles) from the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster.\n\nShortly after invading Ukraine on February 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March. The facility remains near the frontlines, and has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the shelling.\n\nSpecial Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists are on site. Ukrainian staff continue to help operate the plant.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235, which has a half-life of more than 700 million years.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.\n\n3:50 a.m.:\n\n3:30 a.m.: Reuters reported that Italy's defense minister struck a cautious tone on whether Italy would be able to supply Ukraine with air defense systems, as requested by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe systems would be provided \"if possible,\" Guido Crosetto told Il Messaggero newspaper in an article published on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, \"if we give air defense missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality,\" he added.\n\nCrosetto told Reuters this month that the Franco-Italian SAMP/T air defense system was among the military aid that Kyiv had requested from Rome.\n\nHis remarks to Il Messaggero follow a Tuesday call between Zelenskyy and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, after which Zelenskyy tweeted that Rome was considering supplying air defenses.\n\nHe is pressing Ukraine's Western allies to step up military aid to help counter three months of Russian missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nUnder former Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Italy sent five aid packages to Kyiv including military supplies, and Meloni's government is working on a possible sixth delivery.\n\nMeloni, who took office in October, has been a firm supporter of Kyiv, despite friction on the issue within her rightist ruling coalition and a strong pacifist element among domestic public opinion.\n\n2:50 a.m.: Reuters reported that Russia's Gazprom said that it will ship 42.3 million cubic meters of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, a volume broadly in line with recent days.\n\n2:20 a.m.:\n\n2 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.: Russian forces fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday,Reuters reported citing Ukraine's military, as fighting intensified with Russia deploying more tanks and armored vehicles on front lines.\n\nThe General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in its morning report that Russia forces were attacking populated areas on the right bank of the Dnipro River near Kherson with mortars and artillery.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the reports.\n\n1:03 a.m.: Russian troops who have been part of a mobilization drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing the state TASS agency.\n\nQuoting Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan.\n\nThe ministry \"determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilized to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024,\" Trunov was quoted as saying.\n\nFamilies can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so.\n\nRussia called up more than 300,000 reservists to support what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine in a mobilization drive launched in September.\n\nThe drive prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee from the country to avoid being conscripted and sparked the largest anti-Kremlin protests since Russia sent in its troops into Ukraine in February.\n\nThe war, which Ukraine and its Western allies call an unprovoked aggression to grab land is in its 11th month, having entered a slow, grinding phase as bitter winter weather has set in.\n\n12:35 a.m.: Reuters has published an explainer on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys 10-point peace plan, which he first introduced at the G-20 Summit Meeting in November. The plan calls for:\n\n1. Radiation and nuclear safety, focusing on restoring safety around Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, which is now-Russian occupied.\n\n2. Food security, including protecting and ensuring Ukraine's grain exports to the world's poorest nations.\n\n3. Energy security, with focus on price restrictions on Russian energy resources, as well as aiding Ukraine with restoring its power infrastructure, half of which has been damaged by Russian attacks.\n\n4. Release of all prisoners and deportees, including war prisoners and children deported to Russia.\n\n5. Restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity and Russia reaffirming it according to the U.N. Charter, which Zelenskyy said is \"not up to negotiations.\"\n\n6. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities, restoration of Ukraine's state borders with Russia.\n\n7. Justice, including the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes.\n\n8. Prevention of ecocide, protection of environment, with focus on demining and restoring water treatment facilities.\n\n9. Prevention of escalation of conflict and building security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, including guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n10. Confirmation of the war's end, including a document signed by the parties involved.\n\n12:03 a.m.: Ukraine's population may shrink to 35 million by 2030, demographers in Ukraine's Mykhailo Ptukha Institute have predicted, down from the pre-war number of 41 million, Euromaidan Press reported.\n\nThe institute director Ella Libanova said during a presentation that this is the optimistic estimate: Russia's full-blown war is leading to excessive mortality not only by killing people with weapons but through elevated stress, overburdening, insufficient medical care, lack of proper nutrition.\n\nThe pessimistic estimate is 30 million.\n\nUkraine's low birth rate contributes to the problem. In 2021, it was at the extremely low rate of 1.1 children per woman, far below the replacement rate of 2.13-2.15. Libanova expects it to fall in 2023, with 0.8 being the optimistic estimate.\n\nMigration is yet another factor that can contribute to Ukraine's depopulation. Whether refugees who have escaped abroad will return or not depends on the duration of hostilities and post-war conditions in Ukraine.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

Fifty-four enemy cruise missiles were shot down,\" said Ukraines top military general, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhniy.\n\n\"The enemy is attacking Ukraine from various directions with air- and sea-based cruise missiles from strategic aircraft and ships,\" Ukrainian air defense said on social media, describing the scope of the attack as massive.\n\n'Senseless barbarism'\n\nOfficials earlier said more than 120 missiles were fired, according to Reuters. In addition to the cruise missiles, Ukraines military said anti-aircraft and S-300 ADMS (air defense missile system) were used.\n\nRussia has repeatedly used missiles to target Ukrainian cities, including strikes that have destroyed critical infrastructure sites, though it denies targeting civilians.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attacks \"senseless barbarism.\"\n\n\"These are the only words that come to mind seeing Russia launch another missile barrage at peaceful Ukrainian cities ahead of New Year,\" he said.\n\nSeveral people were wounded in the capital, as rescuers continued search-and-rescue operations.\n\n\"At the moment, there are three victims in Kyiv, including a 14-year-old girl.

Ukrainian defense shot down 11 of these drones,\" the Ukraine General Staff said.\n\nLocal officials said the attacks killed at least two people around Kharkiv.\n\nThe strikes also targeted Zaporizhzhia and the Dnipropetrovsk regions, but most of them were downed by the Ukrainian military, the General Staff said, and five drones were shot down around the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nAdditional strikes were aimed at the Black Sea port city of Odesa and Lviv, where Russian attacks are rare, which was left without power. There were power cuts in the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions to reduce potential damage to the power infrastructure.\n\nAndriy Sadovyi, mayor of Lviv, said the attack left his city near the Polish border about 90% without electricity.\n\nShelling on the outskirts of Zaporizhzhia damaged electricity lines and gas pipelines and damaged houses.\n\nRussia has attacked Ukrainian power and water supplies almost weekly since October while its ground forces struggle to hold ground and advance.\n\nAs heavy fighting in the Donbas region continued without significant advances on either side, the Ukrainian military said Russian forces rained scores of missile and rocket salvos along the whole front line in the east, while attempting to push ahead with their stalemated offensive in the Bakhmut and Avdiyivka areas of Donetsk.\n\nUkraine leader promotes peace plan\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been advocating a 10-point peace plan that calls for Russia to recognize Ukraines territory and withdraw its troops.\n\nThe Kremlin reiterated its dismissal of the proposal Wednesday, doubling down on its stance that Ukraine must accept the annexation Russia claimed in September after referendums rejected by Ukraine and most other nations as shams. The four Ukrainian regions include Luhansk and Donetsk in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.\n\n\"There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account todays realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. \"Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful.\"\n\nAfter the latest Russian air strikes, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, \"There can be no neutrality in the face of such mass war crimes.

Moldova accused the channels of airing \"incorrect information\" about the country and Russias military operation in Ukraine. The channels are closely tied to the politician and businessman Ilan Shor, who fled the country in 2019 after the election of the pro-western president, Maia Sandu, Reuters reports. Shor, who is in exile in Israel, has backed protests demanding that Sandus government resign. Russian foreign ministrys spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, was critical of the ban. Photograph: Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service/AP The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"We consider this ban as an unprecedented act of political censorship, as an abuse on the principle of media pluralism and a flagrant violation of the right to freedom of access to information, to which the political leadership of the Republic regularly declares its adherence. \"In light of the unprecedented consequences of its implementation for the Russian-speaking part of the countrys population, we also qualify it as a cynical infringement of the rights of national minorities.\" The ban will start on Monday and last for the duration of a state of emergency that Moldova declared after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nUpdated at 12.00 EST\n\n17 Dec 2022 11.30 EST The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Spnu. Photograph: Vladislav Culiomza/Reuters Moldova has reached a short-term energy deal that will help wean it off its dependence on Russian natural gas, a senior official said on Saturday. The former Soviet republic of 2.5 million people, which faces soaring inflation amid Russias war on neighbouring Ukraine, has traditionally been reliant on Russian gas. The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Spnu, said the state gas firm Moldovagaz would buy 100m cubic metres of gas from domestic supplier Energocom this month. It would be the first time that Moldova has not consumed any of the gas it has bought from Russia, he wrote on his Telegram channel. Spnu added: Since last year, we have promised to make reserves and find an alternative to stop being dependent on a single source. I managed to do it.\n\nUpdated at 11.58 EST\n\n17 Dec 2022 10.17 EST Electricity restored in Kharkiv, says governor Electricity has been restored in Ukraines second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the region, its governor said, a day after Russias latest wave of missile attacks targeted the countrys power grid. Oleh Syniehubov, Kharkivs regional governor, posted on Telegram: The power was cut off in entire Kharkiv region and Kharkiv. Currently, electricity supply has been restored throughout the region and the city. Fridays attack, in which 76 rockets were fired at several Ukrainian regions, caused \"colossal\" damage to Kharkivs electricity infrastructure, its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, yesterday said. He asked for residents to be patient while water, electricity and heating were out.\n\nUpdated at 10.19 EST\n\n17 Dec 2022 09.17 EST Polands top policeman said that an explosion in his office was caused by a grenade launcher, telling private broadcaster RMF FM that he had received two of the weapons as a gift from Ukraine. Polands interior ministry and prosecutors office had not previously confirmed media reports that the explosion on Wednesday, at police headquarters in Warsaw, was caused by a grenade launcher. Prosecutors said they were investigating the blast, which resulted in police commander in chief Jarosaw Szymczyk being taken to hospital, Reuters reported. \"When I was moving the used grenade launchers, which were gifts from the Ukrainians, there was an explosion,\" Szymczyk told RMF FM. He said he was moving the launchers into an upright position at the time. RMF cited a source from a Polish delegation that visited Ukraine as saying Szymczyk had received two launchers from officials as presents during visits to the police and the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. The officials had assured the Polish delegation that the launchers were not loaded, and the delegation took them back to Warsaw by car before leaving them in the back room of Szymczyks office, the source told RMF.

The United States has also previously described Putins stance as insincere because of the ongoing assaults.\n\nIn the interview aired on Moscows Rossiya 1 television, Putin said, \"we are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions\". But \"that is up to them we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,\" he said.\n\nAn adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, said Putin needed to return to reality and acknowledge it was Russia that did not want talks.\n\n\"Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,\" the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted. \"Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.\"\n\nPutin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, with the stated aim of toppling the so-called \"neo-nazi regime\" in Ukraine, triggering the deadliest European conflict since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nThe Russian leader said the West had begun the conflict in 2014 by toppling a pro-Moscow Ukrainian president in the Maidan Revolution protests. Soon after, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatist forces began fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"Actually, the fundamental thing here is the policy of our geopolitical opponents which is aimed at tearing apart Russia, historical Russia,\" Putin said, referring to a concept that argues that Ukrainians and Russians are one people.\n\n\"They [the West] have always tried to divide and conquer Our goal is something else to unite the Russian people,\" he said.\n\n\"We are acting in the right direction, we are protecting our national interests, the interests of our citizens, of our people,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked if the geopolitical conflict with the West was approaching a dangerous level, Putin said: \"I dont think its so dangerous.\"\n\nThe remarks come as Ukraine announced a country-wide air raid alert twice on Sunday.\n\nThree missiles hit the city of Kramatorsk in the partially-occupied Donetsk region in the afternoon, local officials reported later. The missiles hit an industrial area of the city, and there were no casualties, according to the Ukrainian governor of Donetsk, Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nUkraines top military command also reported 10 Russian attacks on the Kupiansk district in the Kharkiv region. It said Moscows forces shelled more than 25 towns along the Kupiansk-Lyman front line and hit nearly 20 others in the Zaporizhia region.\n\nA day before, a Russian attack on the southern city of Kherson, retaken by Ukrainian forces last month, killed and wounded dozens of people. The Russian forces shelled Ukrainian-held areas of the partially-occupied Kherson region 71 times over the past 24 hours, including 41 attacks on the city of Kherson, the regions Ukrainian Governor Yaroslav Yanushevich reported on Sunday.\n\nA total of 16 people have been killed, according to the official, including three emergency workers killed in the process of demining the Berislav district of the region. Yanushevich said that 64 more have been wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, relentless Russian attacks on power-generating facilities since October have regularly left millions of Ukrainians without heat and water.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it will fight until all its territorial aims are achieved, while Ukraine says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from the country.\n\nPutin on Sunday described Russia as a \"unique country\" and said the vast majority of its people were united in wanting to defend it.\n\n\"As for the main part the 99.9 percent of our citizens, our people who are ready to give everything for the interests of the Motherland there is nothing unusual for me here,\" he said.\n\n\"This just once again convinces me that Russia is a unique country and that we have an exceptional people. This has been confirmed throughout the history of Russias existence.\"",

                "cc_text": "Over the past several months, Russia has launched multiple waves of missiles and drone attacks across Ukraine. The heaviest attack so far came on November 15, when more than 100 missiles targeted a dozen cities and districts, as well as the countrys critical energy infrastructure. Ukraine had relied mostly on Soviet-era defense systems such as the S-300. But now that air defense is Ukraines top priority, Western countries have been pushed to provide more sophisticated devices. Here are some of the systems that are helping to defend Ukrainian skies. S-300: Old But Still Powerful The S-300 is a long-range surface-to-air system, originally developed in the Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. It is capable of targeting aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles.\n\nAt least 17 countries -- including Ukraine, Russia, and several NATO members have the S-300. While its technically a defense system, Russia seems to have repurposed it to strike ground targets, too. This is why there was initially some confusion over who was responsible for the missile that hit Poland in November. Before the invasion, Ukraine had about 250 S-300 systems, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Several more have been delivered since then, as part of military aid. It remains unclear how many have been destroyed by Russian missiles. IRIS-T: The First Modern System From The West On October 11, Ukraine received its first modern Western defense system from Germany: IRIS-T, one of the world's most advanced air-defense systems. Back in June, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised that four of these systems would be delivered, and the deal was expected to be finalized by the end of this year. However, Russias deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities have sped up the process. Ukraine now has one battery that consists of a radar, command-and-control system, and three missile launchers, carrying a total of 24 missiles. Three more batteries are expected next year, mostly due to the long manufacturing process.\n\nIRIS-T can purportedly protect an entire city from missiles that are up to 40 kilometers away. It also detects low-flying missiles (such as Kalibr) and drones thanks to its sensitive radar, which integrates data from various sources. IRIS-T is manufactured in southern Germany and is relatively new. It has been in development since the 1990s, and tests of the latest version were finalized in 2021. NASAMS: Western Deliveries Continue On November 7, Ukraine received another delivery of sophisticated air-defense systems: NASAMS, sent from the United States. NASAMS was developed in the 1990s by U.S. and Norwegian companies, and it is the same system that protects the airspace around Washington, D.C. It is a middle-range defense system, armed with three launchers that can carry a total of 18 missiles (up to six missiles each). Its radar uses multiple sources of data, which enables it to intercept targets beyond visual range. The system can also engage multiple targets simultaneously, so it is less likely to be overwhelmed by a large number of attack missiles.\n\nThe system uses AMRAM missiles with a range of 40 kilometers (the newer version could even reach 100 kilometers), capable of hitting various targets, including unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. The United Kingdom is set to donate hundreds of these to Ukraine. Patriot: At Long Last? For months Ukraine has been requesting another long-range air-defense system, the U.S.-made Patriot. This system can destroy short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft, and cruise missiles. It was first deployed in the 1980s and is considered one of the most advanced U.S. air-defense systems.\n\nThe West has been hesitant to provide the Patriot, mostly due to its complicated technology. One battery requires about 90 personnel to operate, so Ukrainian forces would need extensive training. Some governments were also concerned about escalating the conflict further. When Poland turned down Germanys offer of two Patriot batteries and suggested sending them to Ukraine instead, the proposal was rejected because the system would have been operated by NATO personnel and would therefore require NATO involvement in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the United States has recently announced additional military assistance for Ukraine, including a transfer of the Patriot defense system. Hawk In November, Spain sent a total of six U.S.-made HAWK air-defense systems to Ukraine. The United States is also considering sending a few older HAWK systems from storage, but these would probably need to be refurbished first. The HAWK was developed in the 1950s by Raytheon Technologies and was mostly phased out during the 2000s. It is a mobile system that provides defense against low-to-medium-altitude aircraft and is expected to be effective against Iranian drones.\n\nThe launcher vehicle is typically accompanied by a radar vehicle and a command-and-control vehicle. These vehicles may vary depending on the type of launcher. Smaller Defense Systems: Avenger, Gepard, And Vampire The United States also donated four Avenger air-defense systems, which provide short-range protection against drones and helicopters. This system is mounted on a Humvee vehicle and is equipped with up to eight Stinger missiles and a machine gun. It can destroy targets up to 8 kilometers away. Avenger is not as sophisticated as some other systems such as NASAMS or IRIS-T. It uses optical sight and short-range laser to detect targets, and the missile range is considerably shorter. However, it is valuable thanks to its high mobility.\n\nIn July, Germany supplied 30 decommissioned Gepards. These antiaircraft guns were developed in the 1970s in Germany to counter low-flying, armored attack helicopters, such as the Russian (then-Soviet) Mil Mi-24. They also seem to be effective in engaging small targets, such as Iranian-made kamikaze drones that Russia uses.\n\nThe Flakpanzer Gepard (Flakpanzer is a German term for a tank-based antiaircraft vehicle) can spot targets up to 15 kilometers away and engage them within 6 kilometers.\n\nBesides Gepards, Germany has also provided approximately 6,000 rounds of ammunition. On top of that, another 12,000 rounds are currently on hold. Germany bought these from Switzerland some decades ago on the condition that Switzerland would have a veto over future resale or donation. So far, requests to lift the veto have been rejected. The United States has also committed to providing the Vampire system, a laser-guided missile launcher. It is a portable weapon that can be mounted on most pickup-truck beds, even on nontactical vehicles. According to its U.S. manufacturer, the system is relatively small and can be installed within two hours by two people. Only one person is needed for operation.\n\nThe Vampire is effective against unmanned aerial systems but can engage ground targets, too. Delivery is expected in the middle of next year. Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems Additionally, portable missiles (also known as MANPADS) have played an important role in Ukrainian defense. The United Kingdom supplied Starstreak missiles while Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States sent Stinger missiles. Poland provided Piorun missiles.\n\nAll these systems can be transported by foot or vehicle and are shoulder-fired. They are effective against low-flying aircraft such as helicopters at a range of a few kilometers.\n\nStinger and Piorun missiles are so-called \"heat-seekers\". That means they use infrared homing to lock on to the hot engine exhaust that the target produces. Starstreak missiles, on the other hand, are guided by a laser beam.",

It added that a number of Kamikaze drones had also been used.\n\nBrig Gen Oleksiy Hromov said in an operational update that the strikes had been targeted at energy infrastructure across the entire country.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRescue teams examine a damaged home in the Kyiv region\n\nTwo homes in Kyiv were damaged by debris from intercepted missiles, according to the city military administration. Mr Klitschko said 16 missiles were destroyed over the city by air defences.\n\nIn the southern region of Mykolaiv, Governor Vitaly Kim wrote that five missiles were intercepted by air defences, while Mayor Andriy Sadovy said several explosions had been reported in the western city of Lviv.\n\nIn the Odesa region Mr Marchenko said 21 missiles were shot down by the Ukrainian military. He added that missile fragments had hit a residential building but no casualties were reported.\n\nAnd in a village in the western region of Ivano-Frankivsk, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky said a missile had crashed into a resident's home but did not explode. The BBC cannot independently verify the report.\n\nMr Podolyak said the strikes were \"evil\" and accused Moscow of seeking \"to destroy critical infrastructure and kill civilians en masse\".\n\nKyrylo Tymoshenko\n\nThis unexploded missile struck a house in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, according to presidential official Kyrylo Tymoshenko\n\nDozens of Russian attacks have pounded Ukraine in recent weeks, causing repeated power cuts across the country. Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said the latest strikes had damaged power generating facilities and said the situation was \"difficult\" in the Odesa and Kyiv regions.\n\nThe mayor of Lviv said on Thursday that 90% of his city was without power, while Mr Klitschko said that 40% of Kyiv had been left without power.\n\nPower cuts were also reported in the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions.\n\nOleksandr Vilkul, head of the Military Administration in the central city of Kryvyi Rih, said missiles fired at his city had been launched from Russian \"ships and planes from the Black Sea\". Power in the city had been switched off as a \"precaution\", he added.\n\nUkraine's southern command had already issued a warning that Russian forces were preparing to launch up to 20 missiles from positions in the Black Sea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in its missile strikes. However, President Vladimir Putin has recently admitted that Russian troops have been hitting Ukraine's critical energy facilities.\n\nThe admission followed allegations from some international leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, that targeting energy facilities could amount to a war crime.\n\nIn one barrage earlier this month, Ukraine said it shot down 60 of more than 70 missiles fired by Russian forces.\n\nThe government in Kyiv has pleaded with Western leaders to provide it with additional air defences, and US President Joe Biden recently agreed to supply its Patriot system.\n\nThursday's attack came just hours after the Kremlin rejected Ukraine's suggestion that peace talks could begin in 2023.\n\nThe UK's ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, wrote on Twitter that the attacks proved \"Russia does not want peace with Ukraine. Russia wants the subjugation of Ukraine\".\n\nAnd Maia Sandu, president of neighbouring Moldova, condemned the strikes as \"barbaric, unprovoked acts designed to bring about destruction and death\".\n\nUkraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told the BBC that Russia would continue to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure for as long as it could.\n\n\"Continuing that thought, can they do this long?\" he asked, \"No, because there are not many missiles left.\n\n\"The defence industry is incapable of producing enough to provide that many missile strikes. This is another reason why they are now trying to find missile weapons in other countries of the world.\"\n\nEarlier this month, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency that Moscow had been forced to use decades-old ammunition with high failure rates in recent weeks.\n\nAnd the UK's ambassador to the UN said Russia was attempting to obtain more weapons from Iran, including hundreds of ballistic missiles.",

I know darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario,\" he said in an evening video address on Christmas Day.\n\nUkraine has traditionally not celebrated Christmas on 25 December, but 7 January, the same as Russia. However, this year some Orthodox Ukrainians decided to celebrate the holiday on 25 December and Ukrainian officials, starting with Zelenskyy and Ukraines prime minister, issued Christmas wishes on Sunday.\n\nThe Kremlin says it will fight until all its territorial aims are achieved, while Kyiv says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from the country.\n\nAsked if the geopolitical conflict with the West was approaching a dangerous level, Putin on Sunday said: \"I dont think its so dangerous.\"\n\nKyiv and the West say Putin has no justification for what they cast as an imperial-style war of occupation.\n\nBlasts at Engels airbase\n\nBlasts were heard at Russias Engels air base, hundreds of kilometres (miles) from the Ukraine frontlines, Ukrainian and Russian media reported on Monday.\n\nRussias governor of Saratov region, home to the Engels air-base, said law enforcement agencies were checking information about \"an incident at a military facility\".\n\n\"There were no emergencies in residential areas of the (Engels) city,\" Roman Busargin, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. \"Civil infrastructure facilities were not damaged.\"\n\nThe air base, near the city of Saratov, about 730 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, was hit on 5 December in what Russia said were Ukrainian drone attacks on two Russian air bases that day. The strikes dealt Moscow a major reputational blow and raised questions about why its defences failed, analysts said.\n\nUkraine has never publicly claimed responsibility for attacks inside Russia, but has said, however, that such incidents are \"karma\" for Russias invasion.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

Russian state media agency Tass quotes the defence ministry as saying: On December 26, at around 01:35 Moscow time (2235 GMT), a Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down at low altitude while approaching the Engels military airfield in the Saratov region. As a result of the fall of the wreckage of the drone, three Russian technical servicemen who were at the airfield were fatally injured.\" There are reports of Air Raid Sirens and Explosions being heard at Engels Air Force Base in the Saratov Region of Russia, this Air Base is a Major Bomber Base and is the primary Operations Base for the Tupolev Tu-160 \"Blackjack\" Heavy Strategic Bomber. pic.twitter.com/XciJuje56u OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) December 26, 2022 The Guardian has not verified whether the drone was shot down, as opposed to having struck its target as intended. Earlier reports said blasts were heard at Russias Engels airbase hundreds of miles from frontlines in Ukraine. The RBC-Ukraine news agency reported that two explosions took place. The airbase, near the city of Saratov, is about 730km (450 miles) south-east of Moscow more than 600 kilometres (370 miles) from Ukraine. It was also hit earlier this month.\n\nUpdated at 03.28 EST\n\n26 Dec 2022 14.10 EST Further details from the Ukraine foreign ministers interview with Associated Press has revealed that the US government plans to get a Patriot missile battery ready to be operational in the country in under six months. Dmytro Kuleba said he is \"absolutely satisfied\" with the results of president Volodymyr Zelenskiys visit to the US last week, where he secured a pledge by the US for the surface-to-air missile system. Training to operate the Patriots usually takes up to a year. Zelenskiy has sought Patriot missiles to help counter three months of Russian missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure, including Ukraines power grid.\n\n26 Dec 2022 13.35 EST The governor of the north-eastern Kharkiv region, Oleg Sinegubov, said Russian shelling has hit several towns and villages today. On his Telegram channel, he said a 72-year-old woman was hospitalised in Vovchansk, a city in the region, after she sustained a shrapnel wound yesterday. Sinegubov warned people in the region to stay in shelters because of attacks by Russian forces.\n\nUpdated at 13.40 EST\n\n26 Dec 2022 13.03 EST Ukraine aims to have peace summit in February, says foreign minister AP reports that Ukraines foreign minister said today that his government is aiming to have a peace summit by the end of February. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Ukraine will do whatever it can to win the war in 2023, adding that diplomacy always plays an important role. Every war ends in a diplomatic way. Every war ends as a result of the actions taken on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. Kuleba said the Ukrainian government would like to have a peace summit by the end of February. The United Nations could be the best venue for holding this summit, because this is not about making a favour to a certain country. This is really about bringing everyone on board. Kuleba said that UN, with the secretary general, Antnio Guterres, could be the possible mediator for peace talks. He has proven himself to be an efficient mediator and an efficient negotiator, and most importantly, as a man of principle and integrity. So we would welcome his active participation.

Yaroslav Yanushevich told his Telegram channel that 64 people were injured in the attack, 18 people were in a serious condition, and that 11 people had been killed. Yanushevich said: 64 people from Kherson were injured, 18 people are currently in serious condition. Our heroic medical workers are fighting for the lives of each and every one of the wounded at this moment, without giving up their hands. They were at the epicentre of the tragedy to save and help the people of Kherson.\n\nUpdated at 12.16 EST\n\n26 Dec 2022 10.30 EST Ukraine calls for Russia to be expelled from UN security council Ukraine has called for Russia to be removed as a permanent member of the security council, arguing that Moscows \"illegitimate\" presence in the UN has been \"marked by wars and seizures of other countries territories\". In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said: Ukraine calls on the member states of the UN ... to deprive the Russian Federation of its status as a permanent member of the UN security council and to exclude it from the UN as a whole. It argued that Russia had illegally occupied \"the seat of the USSR in the UN security council\" since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. The statement continued: From a legal and political point of view, there can be only one conclusion: Russia is a usurper of the Soviet Unions seat on the UN security council. Three decades of its \"illegal\" presence in the UN \"have been marked by wars and seizures of other countries territories\", Kyiv said. Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said yesterday that the question of Russias veto-wielding permanent seat in the UN security council also held by the US, Britain, France and China was already being discussed around diplomacy circles. 31 years ago Russia abused the UN Charter and usurped USSRs seat at the UN Security Council bypassing the only legitimate procedure set by the Charter. Russias presence at the UNSC and the UN as a whole is illegitimate. Ukraines official statement: https://t.co/rZVC1pV0MY Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) December 26, 2022 Speaking during a national television marathon late on Sunday, Kuleba said: These issues are not yet discussed at press conferences and in public statements by the leaders of states and governments, but at a lower level, people are already asking the question what Russia should become like in order not to pose a threat to peace and security.\n\nUpdated at 10.33 EST",

The debate in Congress over the bill was punctuated by a visit on Wednesday by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who thanked Americans for bolstering his countrys war effort against Russia and argued the US funds were a good \"investment.\"\n\nZelenskyy returned from Washington his first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February with the pledge by the United States of a Patriot surface-to-air missile battery to bolster his hard-pressed air defenses.\n\nHe long has sought Patriot missiles to help counter three months of Russian missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure, including Ukraines power grid. Millions have been left without electricity, heat and water as temperatures plunge below freezing.\n\nUS officials say, however, that the single Patriot battery that Biden promised Zelenskiy during their White House meeting on Wednesday will not change the course of the war.\n\nIn his regular nightly video address, Zelenskyy warned Ukrainians that Russia could launch more strikes over Christmas, urging them to \"pay attention to air raid alarms, help one another and look out for one another.\"\n\n\"With the holiday season fast approaching, the Russian terrorists could again step up their activities,\" he said. \"They have no regard for Christian values or any values for that matter.\"\n\nSwitching to Russian, Zelenskyy warned that \"citizens of Russia must clearly understand that terror never goes without a response.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nHe said that he had met his top commanders to review the military situation and that his government is \"preparing for various scenarios of action by the terrorist state. And we will respond.\"\n\nWashington and its allies have been unwilling to supply Kyiv with modern battle tanks and long-range missiles called ATACMS that could reach far behind frontlines and into Russia itself.\n\nKyiv and the Biden administration are wary that retaining US congressional support for aid could become more complicated when Republicans take a slim majority in the House next year: some rightwing Republicans oppose aid and other lawmakers have called for tighter oversight.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin made a visit on Friday to the city of Tula, known for arms manufacturing, where he was shown telling defence industry chiefs to boost output of weapons for the front.\n\nIn Bakhmut, an eastern Ukrainian city that has become the target of Russian attempts to advance in recent weeks in fighting that has killed thousands of soldiers, Valerii Deriukha, 55, was one of the few residents who have not fled.\n\nHe was chopping twigs for firewood as artillery explosions rang out.\n\n\"You see with your own eyes what life is like here. What life? It is war,\" he said. Two storeys had been blasted off a building nearby. \"How is life? You see for yourself.\"\n\nDTEK, the largest private investor in Ukraines power sector, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian shelling on Friday halted operations at one of its power plants, killed one employee and injured another. The firm, which owns eight thermal power stations, did not identify the plant that was hit.\n\nReported reinforcements\n\nUkraine has driven Russian forces from the areas around its capital Kyiv and second biggest city Kharkiv. Moscow is now focused on holding areas its forces occupy in southern and eastern Ukraine around a fifth of the country.\n\nUkrainian forces repelled attacks on at least 17 eastern settlements, the general staff said early on Friday.\n\nIt added that Kremlin forces had launched 12 missile and air strikes, including on civilian targets, away from the front lines in eastern and southeastern Ukraine.\n\nThe exiled mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol in the south said more Russian troops had been brought into the city and were strengthening fortifications, with residents now only able to leave on foot.\n\nA car bomb exploded in the city earlier in the day, Ivan Fedorov added in his online media briefing.\n\nRussian forces shelled the southern Kherson region 61 times in 24 hours, half of those within Kherson city, killing one person, Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said. Russia withdrew from that city last month.\n\nIn the Russia-held portion of neighbouring Zaporizhzhia region, the Russia-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, said shelling of the nuclear power plant there had \"almost stopped\" but Russian troops would not leave.\n\nUkraine and Russia have accused each other of risking nuclear disaster in fighting near the plant, Europes largest, and the United Nations has called for a safe zone there.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has called for a safe zone around the plant to reduce the risk of nuclear disaster, said talks with the two sides were making progress on the issue.\n\nReuters was not able to confirm the battlefield reports.\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden.\n\n\"It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets,\" retired Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks previously told CNN of the systems capabilities.\n\nThe Patriots radar system combines \"surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,\" a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. The systems engagements with incoming aerial threats are \"nearly autonomous\" aside from needing a \"final launch decision\" from the humans operating it.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly asked for the US Armys Patriot an acronym for Phased Array Tracking Radar for intercept on Target system, as it is considered one of the most capable long-range air defense systems on the market. And though the US did not fulfill the request for the first 10 months of the war, a senior administration official told CNN that the \"reality of what is going on\" on the ground in Ukraine influenced their decision to do so.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Russian military has increasingly attacked Ukraines power grid and infrastructure as winter approached and the temperatures dropped. Zelensky told Biden that \"Russian missile terror\" had knocked out roughly half of Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nThose attacks have only further fueled Ukraines asks for the Patriot. In fact, the Army calls the Patriot system the services \"most advanced air defense system,\" which can intercept \"any aerial threat\" under \"any weather conditions.\"\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of US Army Europe, told CNN that there is likely some unrealistic expectations about what a Patriot battery will be able to do for Ukraine. It wont, for example, be available to use immediately after the US agrees to provide it it takes months to train troops on how to use the complex system, Hertling said, adding that training US troops to serve as maintainers or repairmen takes around a year. And it wont be able to provide blanket cover for the entire country.\n\n\"These systems dont pick up and move around the battlefield,\" Hertling said. \"You put them in place somewhere that defends your most strategic target, like a city, like Kyiv. If anyone thinks this is going to be a system that is spread across a 500-mile border between Ukraine and Russia, they just dont know how the system operates.\"\n\nIndeed, Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, told CNN that the Patriot is \"not a game-changer\" because it is \"still only able to defend a relatively small piece of dirt.\"\n\nNot to mention the significant logistical needs; just one battery is operated by roughly 90 soldiers, and includes computers, an engagement control system, a phased array radar, power generating equipment, and \"up to eight launchers,\" according to the Army.\n\nCSIS recently said in a report that the missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each. Rounds that expensive likely wont be used to shoot down every missile Russia launches toward Ukraine, Hertling said.\n\n\"This is not a system that will go after drones or smaller ballistic missiles,\" he said. \"Can it do that? Absolutely. But when youre talking about knocking down a $20,000 drone, or a $100,000 ballistic missile that Russia buys, with a $3-5 million rocket, that doesnt give you much of a return on the investment. What it can do it free up the low and medium systems to go after those kind of targets.\"\n\nThe system has been purchased by other US allies, including Israel, Germany, and Japan, and was sent to Poland in an effort to help them defend themselves against Russia as it invaded Ukraine on its border. The US military made clear in March when the Patriot system was sent to Poland that it was purely for defensive purposes of NATO territory and \"will in no way support any offensive operations.\"\n\nAnd in Ukraines case, Hertling says offensive operations are far more important than the Patriot system. CNN first reported last month that the US was considering a dramatic increase in the training provided to Ukrainian forces by instructing as many as 2,500 troops a month at a US base in Germany. The Pentagon said this month that combined arms training of battalion-sized elements, which will include infantry maneuvers and live fire exercises, would begin in January.\n\n\"The Patriots are a defensive, anti-ballistic and anti-aircraft weapon system, with the emphasis on defensive,\" Hertling said. \"You dont win wars with defensive capabilities. You win wars with offensive capabilities.\"",

Biden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during the expected visit, a significant boost in aid headlined by the Patriot missile systems within the package, a US official told CNN.\n\nThe new announcement will add to the nearly $20 billion in US security assistance provided to Ukraine since Russias invasion began, and will come at the same moment US lawmakers are considering a sweeping government spending measure that includes an additional $45 billion in emergency assistance to the country.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on a potential visit or Biden announcement or new security assistance announcements.\n\nLawmakers are also planning for Zelensky to visit Capitol Hill to speak on Wednesday evening, though sources say the visit hasnt been finalized as officials work through security preparations.

We just dont know,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN if the invitation had been made to him, she said: \"No. Not until we know if he can come.\"\n\nA visit by the Ukrainian leader to Washington would amount to a significant moment 10 months since Russias war in Ukraine began. Zelensky has emerged as an international personification of Ukrainian resistance to the invasion and has spent much of the year asking nations for support.\n\nHes delivered those appeals virtually, beaming into international summits and global legislatures to make his case for more weapons and funding. He has remained inside his country for the duration of the war, a reflection both of his desire to rally his besieged country and the precarious security situation he would face outside Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of the war, Zelensky remained bunkered down in the capital Kyiv, often addressing the nation from undisclosed locations. More recently, hes traveled to some of the wars fronts, including on Tuesday when he visited the frontline city of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked in brutal battle there for months.\n\nZelensky met with soldiers and handed out awards, according to his office. Video posted by state TV showed the president clad in fatigues and a flak vest presenting awards to troops. Bakhmut has seen some of the most ferocious fighting in the whole of the country since Russian forces launched their siege on the city in earnest in May, turning it into ruins.\n\nPelosi has been making calls to members urging them to show up to the Capitol on Wednesday over fears the chamber would be empty ahead of the holiday recess, one member said. Pelosi asked for members to be in attendance Wednesday night \"for a very special focus on Democracy.\"\n\nThe expectation from members, per several sources, is Zelensky will address Congress on Wednesday. But the sources caution that this may not be final yet over security concerns.\n\nUkraine has been calling for the US to send the advanced long-range air defense system that is highly effective at intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles as it comes under a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks that have destroyed key infrastructure across the country.\n\nA Patriot missile battery would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for NATO nations in eastern Europe. CNN first reported last week that the US was planning to send Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear how many missile launchers will be sent but a typical Patriot battery includes a radar set that detects and tracks targets, computers, power generating equipment, an engagement control station and up to eight launchers, each holding four ready-to-fire missiles.\n\nOnce the plans are finalized, the Patriots are expected to ship quickly in the coming days and Ukrainians will be trained to use them at a US Army base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, officials said.\n\nUkraine has been asking for the system for months but the logistical challenges of delivering it and operating it are immense. Despite those obstacles, \"the reality of what is going on the ground\" led the administration to make the decision, the senior administration official told CNN, noting the continuing intense Russian missile barrages.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

                "cc_text": "With the White House expected to announce the release of a Patriot battery for Ukraines use, there is once again a debate raging in Washington about what new equipment can, or should, be sent to Kyivs aid. In the following op-ed, John Hardie and Bradley Bowman argue that there is another capability the Biden administration should clear for Ukraines defense a fairly cheap weapon with a long-range to strike at Russian targets.\n\nThe Kremlin on Dec. 13 rejected a Ukrainian peace proposal that called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine, instead insisting that Kyiv should simply accept the \"new realities\" and cede its occupied territories to Moscow. Its a clear sign from Moscow: theyre not interested in this war ending anytime soon. To help Ukraine defeat Russias invasion and liberate its land and people, Washington needs to redouble efforts to provide Ukrainians with the weapons they need.\n\nOne way to do that, which is apparently now under consideration, is sending Kyiv the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB). This system, which integrates an existing munition and rocket at a relatively low cost, would enable the Ukrainian military to strike high-value Russian targets well beyond the range of current Western-supplied munitions. That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory. For this reason, the Pentagon should move without delay to provide Kyiv with the GLSDB.\n\nA joint project by Saab and Boeing, the GLSDB marries two affordable, combat-proven systems: the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, a 113 kg precision-guided munition that is relatively cheap at around $40,000 each, and the M26, a low-cost, formerly demilitarized rocket. The system could include a multi-purpose warhead tailored for fixed, hardened, low collateral damage, and moving targets.\n\nThe GLSDB would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian military targets up to 150 km away with an accuracy of around one meter. With integration, the GLSDB can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS rocket artillery systems already supplied to Ukraine by the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nBut it can also be fired by non-traditional launchers, such as from the back of an ordinary-looking truck or from a nondescript shipping container hidden in plain sight. That would make it more difficult for Russian forces to find and destroy the system. The non-traditional launcher also makes the system a low-cost option to augment HIMARS, which US industry is currently racing to produce in order to both replace US launchers sent to Ukraine and meet demand from allies.\n\nOne of the great advantages of the GLSDB is that the munition and rocket already exist in the US arsenal. Industry would only need to integrate the munition and rocket rather than undertaking the time-consuming process of establishing a new production line. Accordingly, depending on several factors, Ukraine could receive an initial delivery of two launchers and 24 weapons in as little as nine months after the Pentagon approves the plan. If industry and the Pentagon move with a sense of urgency and Congress provides assertive oversight, a decision now by the Department of Defense could see an estimated 750 GLSDBs and 12 launchers delivered to Ukraine by the end of 2024. That dramatic ramp up in production is possible because industry simply needs to integrate existing bombs and rockets rather than build new ones.\n\nThats the how. Heres the why: Providing the GLSDB would enhance Ukraines ability to weaken Russian forces by hitting high-value targets deep behind the front lines.\n\nUkraine has employed this strategy to great effect since it received its M142 and M270 systems over the summer, striking key bridges, ammunition and fuel depots, command-and-control nodes, and other high-value targets in Russias rear. This has helped Ukraine halt Russias advances and played a critical role in Ukraines successful counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts.\n\nBut whereas the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets provided for Ukraines M142 and M270 systems can hit targets from around 85 kilometers away, the GLSDB would enable the Ukrainian military to strike targets at almost double that range. For example, the key Russian logistics hub in Luhansk city and its environs, just out of reach of GMLRS, would be well within the GLSDBs range. The same goes for the critical rail hub in the Crimean city of Dzhankoi, which supplies Russias grouping in southern Ukraine. Nearby settlements house major vehicle parks ripe for targeting.\n\nIf Ukraine had the GLSDB, Russia would be forced to move its depots even farther back from the front line, making it more difficult for Russian logistics to provide combat units with sufficient ammunition and other supplies to hold back Ukrainian forces, let alone take ground themselves. Likewise, Ukraine could strike various airbases from which Russian aircraft provide close air support to Russian troops or launch missiles targeting Ukraines critical infrastructure. GLSDB would also help Kyiv target bases in Ukraine from which Russian forces are launching Iranian drones.\n\nIndeed, the best form of air and missile defense includes an offensive strike capability.\n\nThe GLSDB could fulfill some of the missions that would be assigned to ATACMS missiles, which are also fired by the M142 and M270 but have a 300-kilometer range. For months, Kyiv has pleaded for ATACMS. But the White House has refused, fearing that providing these missiles could invite further provocation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis risk is overstated when it comes to ATACMS, and the Biden administration should not let similar fears deter it from sending the GLSDB. Thus far, Moscows reaction to the Wests provision of military aid to Kyiv has featured lots of bark but little bite. Western materiel has enabled Ukraine to stay in the fight and eventually retake large swathes of land, including Ukrainian territory Putin has cynically labeled as part of Russia.\n\nWhile Moscow has escalated attacks in Ukraine, the Kremlin has assiduously avoided attacking any NATO member, despite the Western weapons flowing into Ukraine. Theres little doubt why: Doing so would risk a direct conflict with the United States, something Putin appears keen to avoid, particularly when the bulk of his military is tied down in Ukraine and badly battered.\n\nAs an extra precaution, the Biden administration could condition its provision of the GLSDB on a Ukrainian commitment to use the system only against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Kyiv has honored a similar promise made with respect to HIMARS, and theres every reason to believe the Ukrainians would keep their word with the GLSDB.\n\nThe Kremlin wants Kyiv and the West to accept \"new realities\" in Ukraine following Russias unprovoked invasion. That would be a disaster, inviting more aggression in the future from authoritarian regimes seeking to bully beleaguered democracies and seize territory by force.\n\nIn Ukraine, the United States has a partner willing to fight for our shared interests and principles. They arent asking Americans to do the fighting for them. They are simply asking for the means to defend their homes.\n\nThe GLSDB would provide Ukraine with a powerful tool to advance US and Ukrainian interests. Every day the Pentagon delays its decision on the GLSDB is another day Ukraine will go without this valuable capability. There is no time to waste.\n\nJohn Hardie is deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), where Bradley Bowman is senior director of FDDs Center on Military and Political Power.",

That follows Sunak's meeting on Monday in Latvia with members of a U.K.-led European military force.\n\nForeign ministers in the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation are also due to meet Tuesday.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will hold virtual talks sometime this month, according to Russian news reports.\n\nAnd Ukrainians and Russians are heading into their first Christmas or Hanukkah festivities since the Kremlin launched its full-on invasion of Ukraine in late February.\n\nWhat happened last week\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said Dec. 13 it made an agreement with Ukraine's government to send nuclear safety and security experts to each of the country's nuclear power plants.\n\nRussia launched waves of attacks on Kyiv, including on Dec. 14, Dec. 16 and again before dawn on Monday. Ukraine said it managed to shoot down many of the incoming explosive drones, but some caused destruction.\n\nAn American was freed from Russian-controlled territory as part of a 65-person prisoner exchange. Suedi Murekezi told ABC News he spent weeks in a basement, where he was tortured, and months in a prison in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.\n\nEU lawmakers approved about $19 billion in financing for Ukraine, Dec. 14, and more sanctions on Russia. The aid package followed pledges earlier in the week from dozens of countries and global institutions to support more than $1 billion in winter relief funds for Ukraine, helping the country with power, heat, food and medical supplies.\n\nThe United States is expected to provide Patriot missiles to Ukraine, an apparent response to the Ukrainian government's urgent call for more weapons to shoot down Russian missiles, according to several U.S. news reports. The surface-to-air guided missile system can target aircraft and missiles. While the single battery the U.S. is expected to supplied would help, some analysts say, it may not be a game changer.\n\nIn-depth\n\nThe Ukraine war isn't new. These intimate photos show 3 families enduring it for years.\n\nUkraine warns Russia is preparing for a major ground offensive this winter.\n\nRussia launches new wave of air attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA century and counting: Ukraine's ongoing fight to free itself from Russia.\n\nThese are the humanitarian crises expected to worsen in 2023.\n\nSpecial report\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is changing the world: See its ripple effects in all corners of the globe.\n\nEarlier developments\n\nYou can read past recaps here.

The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L., was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It said police also raided his flat and workplace as well as those of another person. The statement reads: The accused is suspected of state treason. In 2022, he shared information that he came by in the course of his work with a Russian intelligence agency. The content is considered a state secret. The man was brought today before a judge, who ordered him held in custody pending a possible indictment, prosecutors said. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen whom it suspects of spying for Russia.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Aleksey Rakhmanov, head of the state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) which is overseeing a refit of the carrier, was cited as saying the blaze was quickly extinguished and caused no casualties. Tass cited an emergency service source as saying 20 people had been evacuated. The Admiral Kuznetsov has been out of service and in dry dock for repairs since 2018. Rakhmanov told Russian media in June that he expected the 43,000-tonne, 1,000ft warship to return to service in early 2024.\n\nUpdated at 08.21 EST",

Otherwise, the issue will be decided by the Russian army.\"\n\n'US and NATO want to weaken or destroy Russia'\n\nPutin launched his full-scale invasion on 24 February, claiming the aim was to \"denazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine, which he said was a threat to Russia.\n\nKyiv and the West say Putin's invasion was merely an imperialist land grab. The US and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for its invasion and sent billions of dollars in assistance to the Ukrainian government.\n\nJust last week, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was visiting Washington, the US announced another $1.85 billion (1.69bn) in military assistance for Ukraine, including a transfer of the Patriot Air Defence System, angering Moscow.\n\n\"It is no secret to anyone that the strategic goal of the United States and its NATO allies is to defeat Russia on the battlefield as a mechanism for significantly weakening or even destroying our country,\" Lavrov further told TASS.\n\nHe reiterated that Moscow and Washington could not maintain a normal connection, blaming the administration of US President Joe Biden.\n\nWhile Moscow had planned a swift operation to take over its neighbour, the war is now in its 11th month, marked by many embarrassing Russian battlefield setbacks.\n\nIn the latest attack to expose gaps in Russia's air defences, a drone believed to be Ukrainian penetrated hundreds of kilometres through Russian airspace on Monday, causing a deadly explosion at the main base for its strategic bombers.\n\nMoscow troops keep bombarding Ukraine\n\nRussian forces have been engaged for months in fierce fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, to defend the lands Moscow proclaimed it annexed in September and which make up the broader Ukrainian industrial Donbas region.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have repelled Russian attacks in the areas of two settlements in the Luhansk region, and six in the Donetsk region, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Tuesday.\n\nIn his nightly video message on Monday, Zelenskyy called the situation along the frontline in Donbas \"difficult and painful\".\n\nOleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv, said heavy fighting was going on around elevated areas near Kreminna in the Luhansk region.\n\nHe also said that fighting has picked up along the Bakhmut and Avdiivka, a line of contact further south in the Donetsk region, after a brief easing in previous days.\n\n\"The arc of fire in Donetsk region continues to burn,\" Zhdanov said in a social media video post.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZelenskyy said as a result of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, nearly nine million people were without power. That figure amounts to about a quarter of Ukraine's population.\n\nSergey Kovalenko, head of YASNO, which supplies electricity to Kyiv, said late on Monday that while the power situation has been improving in the city, blackouts will continue.\n\n\"While repairs are underway, emergency shutdowns will continue,\" Kovalenko said on his Facebook page.\n\nPutin hosted leaders of other former Soviet states in St Petersburg on Monday for a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States group, which Ukraine has long since quit.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has been a test of Russia's longstanding authority among other ex-Soviet states.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn televised remarks, Putin made no direct reference to the war while saying threats to the security and stability of the Eurasian region were increasing.\n\n\"Unfortunately, challenges and threats in this area, especially from the outside, are only growing each year,\" he said. \"We also have to acknowledge ... that disagreements also arise between member states of the commonwealth.\"",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has captivated the world by rallying his country against a Russian invasion, visited Washington on Wednesdayhis first trip out of the country in three hundred days of war. With stops at the White House and the Capitol, what messages did Zelenskyy send to US President Joe Biden, members of Congress, and the American people? What does this trip mean for him and for Ukraine? Heres your expert guide to this historic visit. Well continue updating it as contributions roll in.\n\nWatch Zelenskyys address to Congress\n\nClick to jump to an expert reaction:\n\nAnalysis of Zelenskyys appearances at the White House and Congress\n\nJohn Herbst: A powerful message sent to Moscow, with one awkward moment\n\nRachel Rizzo: Dont expect a shift from Biden on long-range weapons\n\nMelinda Haring: Zelenskyys shrewd speech should make an impression on Congress\n\nDoug Klain: Zelenskyy strikes another contrast with Putin on the world stage\n\nYevgeniya Gaber: In the global war for democracy, Ukraines patriots need American Patriots\n\nAnalysis ahead of Zelenskyys arrival in Washington\n\nJohn Herbst: Zelenskyy wants more advanced weapons and explicit support for a Ukrainian victory\n\nDaniel Fried: The visit shows why the US is still the leader of the Free World\n\nMelinda Haring: An attempt to defuse the problem at the White House\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk: A courageous Zelenskyy arrives at a pivotal moment in the war\n\nPeter Dickinson: A plan to consolidate US support for a long struggle\n\nIan Brzezinski: A time for Washington to shed its exaggerated fear of escalation\n\nMatthew Kroenig: Ukraine wants to be able to shoot the archer, not just the arrows\n\nA powerful message sent to Moscow, with one awkward moment\n\nZelenskyys visit was a success for presidents Biden and Zelenskyy and strengthened the US-Ukraine relationship. With this visit, Ukraine received the Patriot air-defense system, the most advanced weapon system that the United States has yet to provide. This served as a clear message to Moscow that US investment in Ukraines defense will only grow. Zelenskyys cordial meeting with Biden and enthusiastically received address to Congress further underscored this.\n\nAt the same time, the visit also made clear the ongoing nuances in the bilateral relationship. The decision to provide Patriots is very important, but the United States is still reluctant to provide the longer range artillery, tanks, and fighter jets that would expedite Ukraines victory. That victory is very much in US interests, because Vladimir Putins revisionist objectives go beyond Ukraine and threaten NATO allies. Bidens one awkward moment during this visit came in the press conference when he was trying to explain why the United States would not provide offensive weapons. Zelenskyy came to the United States to enhance his relationship with Biden, so he did not directly challenge him on this; but in his congressional address he made a low-key pitch for more advanced weapons.\n\nMany commentators are referring to Zelenskyys visit as an historic one. That is true only if Ukraine wins this war. Ukraine will win if US support for Ukraine does not wane; and that victory will come faster if the White House decides to send the weapons Ukraine is requesting. Zelenskyys visit was certainly a contribution to such an outcome.\n\nJohn Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Councils Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nDont expect a shift from Biden on long-range weapons\n\nZelenskyy comes to Washington at the right time: The 118th Congress (with Republicans at the helm at the House of Representatives) commences on January 3, and the one-year anniversary of Russias invasion is just around the corner. To be clear, he deserved a heros welcome, and he got one. Zelenskyy hoped for two things during his visit: to thank the American people and ensure continued unity within the next Congress in terms of military and financial support to Ukraine, and to convince the Biden administration to send increasingly lethal weaponry, including the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).\n\nDuring his visit, the Biden administration formally announced the shipment of the Patriot missile-defense system to Ukraine, which is good news (and something the Ukrainians have sought over the last few months). But the aim of the United Statesto both support Ukraine while ensuring the United States and NATO dont get pulled into a broader warwill continue to preclude the shipment of the sort of weaponry Zelenskyy really wants. At a White House press conference alongside Zelenskyy, Biden said about Ukraine: \"Ive never seen NATO and the EU more united about anything at all, and I see no sign of there being any change.\" However, when asked about the ATACMS, Biden said that NATO is \"not looking to go to war with Russia\" and that that specific weaponry could shatter NATO unity. That should give us at least somewhat of a clear sense of where the Biden administration is (and has been) drawing the line in terms of support. I dont expect that to change significantly in the coming months.\n\nRachel Rizzo is a nonresident senior fellow at the Europe Center.\n\nZelenskyys shrewd speech should make an impression on Congress\n\nZelenskyy and Biden are the undisputed leaders of the free world. While Biden is a clunky speaker, his deep empathy and support for Ukraine will be his presidential legacy.\n\nZelenskyy is not a fluent speaker of English. Nevertheless he both delivered off-the-cuff remarks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and gave prepared remarks before Congress in English. Zelenskyys prepared remarks were shrewd: He thanked Congress repeatedly, reminded them that the fight for Ukraine is not just Kyivs problem, and dangled red meat in front of Republicans as he warned than Irans provision of drones for Russian use in Ukraine cannot be overlookedor Tehran will threaten other allies.\n\nZelenskyy and his team know that Congress and the American people control the purse. In his remarks with Biden, he thanked the American people first and repeatedly thanked Americans for their sacrifice and appealed to their decency.\n\nHis speech before Congress wasnt his bestbut blame the speechwriters. His historical references fell flat, but he did manage to elicit laughter at least once.\n\nZelenskyy was at his best when he teased Congress and said Ukrainian soldiers are more than capable of using American tanks and planes, and said directly that all US assistance is \"not charity\" and its used \"in the most responsible way.\"\n\nIn sum, Zelenskyy guaranteed that US assistance will continue \"as long as it takes,\" as Biden has repeatedly pledged, and undercut skeptical arguments on the American right.\n\nMelinda Haring is the deputy director of the Eurasia Center.\n\nZelenskyy strikes another contrast with Putin on the world stage\n\nThe key takeaway from Zelenskyys historic visit to Washingtonhis first time leaving Ukraine since the February invasionis that Ukrainians do not stand alone in their fight for survival. The images of Zelenskyy being embraced in the White House by Biden stand in stark contrast to Putins recent public appearances with the dictator he propped up in Belarus and the propagandists convincing more Russians to die in Ukraine.\n\nDespite fears that a Republican-led US House could stall further aid, support for Ukraine remains bipartisan and overwhelmingly popular with the American public. Perhaps Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it best on Wednesday: \"Continuing our support for Ukraine is morally right, but it is not only that. It is also a direct investment in cold, hard, American interests.\" It was important for Congress, and Americans, to finally hear first-hand from Zelenskyy why their support matters.\n\nWashington has provided historic and nation-saving aid to Ukraine, now totaling more than one hundred billion dollars. But the United States still needs to step upboth by catching up with other nations by rightly recognizing Russias crimes in Ukraine as genocide, but also by showing that giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to win wont provoke Moscow into starting a new war on top of the one its already losing. Ukraine is asking for critical weapons and armor, and allies such as Germany can be nudged in the right direction by a strong example from the United States, which continues to limit Kyivs ability to end this war sooner. For fear of provoking Putin, the White House said earlier this year it wouldnt send HIMARSthe game-changing system with which one Ukrainian officer earned a medal, which he sent with Zelenskyy to give to Biden as a thanks. All thats happened since the United States sent HIMARS is that Ukraines victories on the battlefield are more numerous.\n\nDoug Klain is a nonresident fellow at the Eurasia Center.\n\nIn the global war for democracy, Ukraines patriots need American Patriots\n\nThree hundred days into the war, the situation in Ukraine has approached a use-it-or-lose-it moment. With Russian massive attacks on critical infrastructure, millions of Ukrainians struggling to survive through the cold winter, and Ukrainian armed forces holding the front line despite the overwhelming Russian firepower, the war has entered a new phase. So far, Ukrainians have proved to be super effective and efficient in using the limited arsenal of arms supplied by their partners, oftentimes outperforming expectations and showing miracles of creativity and resilience. Reaching one hundred thousand Russian casualties and taking back more than a half of the initially occupied territories speaks for itself.\n\nHowever, all miracles have their limits, and the reality is grim. Though undertrained and underequipped, thousands of Russian soldiers have been mobilized in an ambitious plan to increase its military to 1.5 million. Despite international pressure, Russia has bolstered its attack capabilities with new batches of Iranian drones (and, potentially, ballistic missiles) and created multiple new units in Belarus to renew its assault on Ukraine from the north. To deter future waves of Russian aggression, let alone to start the counter-offensive, Ukrainian armed forces critically need to boost their air and missile defense, get longer-range weapons, and increase their rear-area attack capabilities.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor the world can afford the luxury of a protracted or postponed conflict. While Russia cannot obviously win this war on the battlefield, Ukraines victory is possible. Yet it is not irreversible, as the Kremlin is still strong enough to maintain its terror on Ukrainian cities, continue killing civilians, and disrupt international supply chains. Zelenskyys key message was clear: the only force that can put an end to the Russian war on global peace and security is Ukrainian patriots. But to succeed in defending global freedoms, they must be backed by American \"Patriots\"the advanced air-defense systemdefending Ukrainian cities.\n\nRallying the support of the American people and the US Congress remains crucial to ensure the victory of the democratic world. The display of the battle flag from Bakhmut in the US House chamber is a good reminder of where the front line of the global war for democracy runs.\n\nYevgeniya Gaber is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council IN TURKEY and was previously a foreign-policy advisor to the prime minister of Ukraine.\n\nWatch Zelenskyy at the White House\n\nZelenskyy wants more advanced weapons and explicit support for a Ukrainian victory\n\nIt looks like Zelenskyy is coming to DC as the Biden administration officially announces that it isfinallysending advanced Patriot air-defense systems to Ukraine. In light of the massive Russian bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure designed to make life in the winter intolerable, the Patriots are well worth Zelenskyys visit, although the leak last week of the Patriot decision makes this a bit of an anticlimax. The visit gives Zelenskyy and Biden the chance to sit down and talk about the war, and Zelenskyy the opportunity to address Congress and thank the American people for the massive support that has made it possible for Ukraine to withstand the Russian invasion. But Zelenskyy would like the Biden administration to publicly express its support for a Ukrainian victory in this war and to provide the more advanced weapons systemsaccurate artillery and missiles with a range up to three hundred kilometers (186 miles), tanks, and fighter jetsthat would enable Ukraine to take back all of its territory more quickly. Unfortunately, hesitation in the White House makes that outcome, which would serve American interests, a long shot.\n\nJohn Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Councils Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe visit shows why the US is still the leader of the Free World\n\nWhile in Washington, Zelenskyy will probably urge intensified US assistance to cope with Russias ongoing attacks on Ukraines civilian infrastructure and more deliveries of powerful weapons to defend his country, such as air defenses, longer-range accurate artillery and missiles, and possibly tanks and aircraft. The omnibus spending bill that Congress is considering and may pass this week contains nearly $45 billion of additional assistance, and Zelenskyy may hope that his address can help get that assistance over the line.\n\nBut hes also after something more important: Ukrainians look to the United States as the leader of the Free World without irony or mixed feelings. They know that US supportin deed as well as wordhas thwarted Putins plans of national extermination and given Ukraine a fighting chance to win this war of survival. They didnt get the memo about supposed US disengagement, decline, or indifference. Zelenskyy is coming to Washington, not to Brussels, Paris, Berlin, or London, because when the chips are down, its the United States that has the power to make the difference in matters of war and peace. He knows this as much as Winston Churchill did in 1940, as Adolf Hitler battered Britain.\n\nLike Churchill, Zelenskyy also knows that some in the United States, a few on the left and more on the Donald Trump-aligned right, reject the Biden administrations commitment to Ukraine and to the Free World generally. Whether they are called neo-isolationists, America-firsters, or \"realists,\" they are willing, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, to do a sphere-of-influences deal with Putin that would force Ukraine to surrender people and land to Russia, indifferent to the human and strategic disaster this would mean for Ukrainians and, soon thereafter, for others in Europe and for ourselves, as Putin consolidated such a prize and prepared his next aggression.\n\nZelenskyy is also coming to warn the United States against bad deals with dictators. He will not just thank the United States and the American people for their support. He will extoll our support for freedom over the past century, seeking to help us recall our best strategic traditions of helping those fighting for their freedom and ours.\n\nDaniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former US ambassador to Poland.\n\nAn attempt to defuse the problem at the White House\n\nZelenskyy is taking a much-deserved victory lap in Washington today and is here to rally Congress to do more. Zelenskyy is not only commander in chief, hes also communicator in chief. With his pitch-perfect performance and gravelly voice, theres no one more convincing in Kyiv than the Ukrainian president. Hes also coming to defuse the problem at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House remains convinced that Ukraine cant win and that sending long-range missiles and planes would escalate the conflict. Zelenskyy is coming to change minds and burst the myth of these self-created limitations. Hes also coming to rally the world to give more and do more for Ukraine during the holiday season. His visit underscores the physical courage, conviction, and gravitas he has become known for around the worldthe opposite of Vladimir Putinsince the war began.\n\nMelinda Haring is the deputy director of the Eurasia Center.\n\nA courageous Zelenskyy arrives at a pivotal moment in the war\n\nIn the foreign affairs community, a first visit is very symbolic. The full-scale war marked a new era in Ukraine, so the fact Zelenskyys first visit after February 24 is to the United States underlines the decisive US role in Ukraines resistance. The United States is a crucial ally of Ukraine; it is a driver of the Ramstein format for international defense cooperation, provides most of the essential military assistance, supplies economic help, and deters Russian nuclear threats.\n\nUntil now, all post-February communication between US and Ukrainian leaders has been via calls and virtual meetings. That communication cannot replace in-person meetings. Thus, the visit had to occur at the earliest convenience, which was very difficult from a security perspective. Traveling around Ukraine and now abroad, Zelenskyy is showing he is ahead of Russia. He is demonstrating his commitment to personal presence, involvement, and initiative. The fact that Zelenskyy is making this trip, and his earlier trip to Bakhmut (perhaps the most dangerous place on our planet today), speaks to his courage.\n\nThe trip is necessary after the US midterm elections and just before Christmas. As the world enters a new year, US and Ukrainian leaders will outline their essential plans for 2023. Next year will be crucial for this war with the right amount of support. It may mark the wars end, with Ukraine able to push Russian occupants out of its territory. It will also be a year of commencing legal trials against Putin and his government and claiming damages. Thus, next years events may seriously damage and even end Putins regime. Today Putins plans are not working out, his troops have retreated from over half of the initially occupied territory, and he is desperate. To recover the lost initiative, he is planning a new mobilization and another offensive in the first quarter of 2023. That makes it critical for Ukraine to secure the right amount of military assistance.\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk is a distinguished fellow at the Eurasia Center and a former minister of defense of Ukraine.\n\nA plan to consolidate US support for a long struggle\n\nZelenskyys decision to visit the United States on what is his first wartime trip abroad highlights the critical importance of continued US support for the Ukrainian war effort. Following a relatively favorable outcome during the recent US midterm elections, there are no major concerns in Kyiv over the strength of the United States commitment to Ukraine. Nevertheless, there is an eagerness to win over skeptics within the Republican Party and consolidate US backing for what promises to be a protracted struggle.\n\nZelenskyy is well aware of his own star quality and knows that a personal presence in Washington will resonate with members of Congress and wider US audiences. One of the most important aspects of his wartime leadership has been his ability to rally international support. He is clearly hoping that such a high-profile visit to the United States will succeed in securing the political support Ukraine needs to continue fighting through 2023.\n\nThe visit will also send a powerful message to Ukraines other allies and to Russia that the United States stands firmly with Ukraine and will continue to do so in the coming year. This is crucial at a time when the Kremlin hopes to secure a ceasefire in order to rearm and is looking for signs that the West may be ready to compromise. Ukrainian leaders understand the importance of demonstrating to Moscow that such hopes are futile. Nothing could make this clearer than the fanfare of an official visit to the United States.\n\nPeter Dickinson is the editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert section.\n\nA time for Washington to shed its exaggerated fear of escalation\n\nZelenskyys dramatic visit to Washington occurs as the war has entered a crossroads, one that will determine if the war will decisively follow the path of Kyivs recent battlefield successes or bog down into a long-term, violent stalemate with immeasurable costs to Ukraine as well as growing economic burdens on the West.\n\nThe Biden administration has reportedly approved giving Ukraine Patriot air-defense systems to help defend against Putins indiscriminate missile barrages. Zelenskyy will express gratitude for that, but Kyiv also seeks offensive capabilities to push Russian forces off of Ukraines territorytanks, infantry fighting vehicles, aircraft, and longer-range artillery and missiles. All of those are required in short order to bring this war to a just and decisive end.\n\nToward that end, Zelenskyy will have to convince Washington to shed its exaggerated fear that a swift Ukrainian victory would cause Russia to escalate the war with nuclear weapons. Face-to-face meetings with Biden provide the most direct opportunity to make that case. That and an address to a joint session of Congress provide a global podium through which to immediately increase the US and Western commitment to Ukraines battle for survival.\n\nIan Brzezinski is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Councils Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and previously served as US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO policy.\n\nUkraine wants to be able to shoot the archer, not just the arrows\n\nZelenskyys surprise visit to Washington comes with huge risks and opportunities. Zelenskyy is the Winston Churchill of our time, and his personal wartime leadership has been an essential ingredient to Ukraines successful defense in the face of Putins war of aggression. Coming to Washington entails operational dangers to his personal safety; getting him in and out of Kyiv unharmed will be no easy task. And there are huge risks to Ukraines wartime effort if anything were to go wrong. It is doubtful that a successor would be nearly as charismatic or effective.\n\nBut the visit also brings huge potential opportunity. US aid and arms have been the other essential ingredient to Ukraines wartime success, and he hopes to get more of both with an in-person appeal to the US president, Congress, and people. With a planned prime-time address, Zelenskyy will attempt to persuade the American public and a new Congress that they benefit from supporting Ukraine. At the White House, Zelenskyy will attempt to convince Biden that he should lift arbitrary restrictions on weapons sales and give Kyiv the weapons it needs to shoot the archer, not just the arrows.\n\nIt should be a straightforward case to make. The United States greatest national security challenge is that, for the first time in its history, it faces two near-peer nuclear armed adversaries, Russia and China. By arming Ukraine, the United States can significantly blunt the Russian military threat without risking American lives. Here is hoping Zelenskyys trip, and the Ukrainian war effort, succeed.\n\nMatthew Kroenig is the acting director of the Councils Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, and a former US Department of Defense and intelligence community official.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: John E.

These are the only words that come to mind seeing Russia launch another missile barrage at peaceful Ukrainian cities ahead of New Year,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\nUkraine's military said it had shot down 54 missiles out of 69 launched by Russia. Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine - for five hours in the capital Kyiv. Officials had earlier said more than 120 missiles were fired during the assault.\n\nReuters footage showed emergency workers pouring through the smouldering wreckage of residential homes in Kyiv destroyed by a blast and smoke trails of missiles in the sky.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, firefighters worked to extinguish a large blaze at an electricity station. In the southern central city of Zaporizhzhia, houses were damaged and a missile left a huge crater.\n\n\"I woke up to everything shaking, crumbling. I got up and screamed, 'Vitia, Vitia (my husband), where are you?' I ran barefoot on glass. He appeared and glass was falling off him,\" said 60-year-old local resident Halyna.\n\nUkraine's military said Russia had launched air and sea-based cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles at energy infrastructure facilities in eastern, central, western and southern regions. The attacks followed an overnight assault by \"kamikaze\" drones.\n\nMore than 18 residential buildings and 10 critical infrastructure installations were destroyed in the latest attacks, the defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nWaves of Russian air strikes in recent months targeting energy infrastructure have left millions without power and heating in often freezing temperatures.\n\n'SKILL AND EFFICIENCY'\n\n\"The enemy placed a high stake on this attack, preparing for it for two weeks. Ukrainian air defence forces demonstrated an incredible level of skill and efficiency,\" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nEmergency shutdowns of power could be applied in some areas to avoid accidents in the networks, Shmyhal said.\n\n[1/7]Rescuers work at a site of private houses heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine December 29, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko via Telegram/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nKyiv authorities said two private houses in Darnytskyi district were damaged by the fragments of downed missiles and a business and a playground were also damaged. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said 16 missiles were shot down and three people injured in the attacks.\n\nThe mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said on Telegram that 90% of his city near the Polish border was without electricity. The missiles damaged an energy infrastructure unit.\n\nIn the Odesa region, the fragments of one missile hit a residential building, though no casualties were reported, its governor Maksym Marchenko said.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, but Ukraine says its daily bombardment is destroying cities, towns, and the country's power, medical and other infrastructure.\n\nFor months Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked Western countries for further air defence help. The United States last week announced nearly $2 billion in more military aid, including the Patriot Air Defense System, which offers protection against aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles.\n\nBelarus protested on Thursday to Ukraine's ambassador after saying it had downed a Ukrainian S-300 air defence missile. TV footage released by Belarus' state-run BelTA news agency showed what looked like missile debris in a field. A Ukrainian military spokesman in effect acknowledged that the missile was a Ukrainian stray, saying the incident was \"nothing strange, a result of air defence\" and something that \"has happened more than once\".\n\nUkraine's defence ministry said it was ready to invite authoritative experts from countries that do not support \"the terrorist state of Russia\" to participate in an investigation.\n\n\"The worst of it is that peaceful people have suffered again,\" a ministry statement said, citing Russia's bombardment.\n\nIn Russia, a regional governor said air defences had shot down a drone near the Engels air force base, hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines in Ukraine and home to long-range strategic bombers. Russia says Ukraine has already tried to attack the base twice this month.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what President Vladimir Putin calls a \"special military operation\" to demilitarize its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies have denounced Russia's actions as an imperialist-style land grab.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that Zelenskiy's idea of driving Russia out of eastern Ukraine and Crimea with Western help and getting Moscow to pay damages is \"an illusion\", the RIA news agency reported.\n\nThere is still no prospect of talks to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy is pushing a 10-point peace plan that envisages Russia respecting Ukraine's territorial integrity and pulling out all its troops.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters TV team in Zaporizhzhia and by other Reuters bureaux; Writing by Alexandra Hudson, Nick Macfie and Grant McCool; Editing by Gareth Jones\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Peskov branded such allegations of Kyiv as \"groundless and stupid speculations.\"\n\nKyiv puts little store in what the Kremlin says, however.\n\nOn Sunday, the commander of Ukrainian joint forces Serhiy Nayev said in a video statement that Putin last week held an official meeting with the leadership of the Russian army, during which, \"he considered the proposals of the military command for the near and medium term.\"\n\n\"Immediately after that, he announced a meeting with the leadership of Belarus In our opinion, during this meeting, the issues of further aggression against Ukraine and wider involvement of the Armed Forces of Belarus in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, on land, will be worked out,\" Nayev said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting of the staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief on Sunday, during which its members \"considered the situation in Belarus.\"\n\n\"Information was heard about the actual number and armament of enemy military groups. The commanders noted the readiness of the defense forces to respond to any developments,\" the presidential media office said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting between Putin and Lukashenko was held against the background of a massive attack of Iranian-made drones on the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday, which damaged more energy infrastructure in the city.\n\n\"These are [drones] Shaheds from the new batch that Russia received from Iran. 250 items thats how many Shaheds have now been received by the terrorist state,\" Zelenskyy told the meeting of the leaders of the U.K.s Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) the same day.\n\nThe Ukrainian president urged British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak \"to increase the possibility\" of supplying air defense systems to help speed up decisions by other partners.",

This tactic follows a broader strategy of undermining Ukrainian morale and capabilities by destroying the country's energy infrastructure and causing widespread disruptions to civilian life, as the military fails to achieve significant advances on the battlefield (2,5).",
                "summary": "The Russian military's persistent shelling of the Kherson region appears to be multifaceted, with objectives including targeting civilians and infrastructure, such as heating systems and water supply, to exacerbate the hardships of winter and displace the population (1). After withdrawing from Kherson city, the attacks serve both to terrorize the liberated population and to undermine any sense of security or normalcy they might have regained (4). The strategy also seems to be a response to Russia's inability to generate significant military gains or to counter Ukraine's successful counterattacks, by shifting focus to long-range missile and drone attacks to cripple civilian life and infrastructure (2). The relentless shelling and destruction of infrastructure, such as power and heating services, is believed to be part of a wider tactic to punish civilians and create a humanitarian crisis during the harsh winter months (3,5).",
                "more_detailed": "The Russian military's persistent shelling of the Kherson region appears to be part of a strategy to instill fear and disrupt daily life following the withdrawal of their forces from the city. The bombardment has been targeting civilian infrastructure, including heating systems, water supplies, and residential areas, causing casualties among the local population (1,3,7,9). The relentless shelling has intensified since the region's recapture by Ukrainian forces in November, with local officials reporting dozens of attacks daily, resulting in deaths, injuries, and significant damage to the city and its surroundings (1,3,4,6). The attacks have not only inflicted physical harm but have also forced civilians to flee, further destabilizing the recently liberated region (4,8).\n\nThe strategic objectives behind these attacks seem to be multifaceted. On the one hand, they serve to maintain pressure on Ukrainian forces and the civilian population, effectively punishing the region for being reclaimed by Ukraine and also attempting to weaken Ukrainian morale (3,4,5). On the other hand, the shelling and targeting of infrastructure seem to be part of a broader Russian tactic to create difficult living conditions for civilians during the winter months by disrupting essential services such as electricity and heating, thereby compounding the humanitarian crisis in the region (2,5,7). Additionally, the shelling may be intended to prevent Ukrainian forces from consolidating their control over the region and to keep them on the defensive, as well as possibly setting traps for Ukrainian forces on the east bank of the Dnipro River (4,10)."

To combat the contamination risks from disrupted water supplies, Kherson residents have been advised to boil water and continue precautionary measures even after repairs on the main water line have been completed (4). These restoration initiatives are critical as Ukraine continues to face a growing electricity deficit due to shelling, with state power utility Ukrenergo reporting nine missile and 12 UAV attacks on the power grid in the last three months, emphasizing the need for controlled consumption to avoid emergency outages (6)."

The persistent shelling has inflicted colossal infrastructural damage, prompting local authorities to establish \"invincibility points\" to provide essential services amid power outages (6). Despite the ongoing Russian offensive, Ukrainian officials maintain that the dynamics of the conflict continue to favor Ukraine, with Russia experiencing a net loss in strength, capability, and territory over time (9). However, the sustained shelling of Kherson and its vicinity since the Ukrainian liberation of the west bank in November underlines the continued Russian focus on the region, with the pattern of attacks remaining fairly steady, marked by repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure and residential areas (3,7,10)."

By targeting Kherson's city center and other recently liberated settlements with frequent shelling, Russian forces aim to challenge Ukrainian control of the area and possibly to prepare for further offensive operations. These bombardments also serve as a deterrent, hindering the ability of Ukraine to consolidate its gains and rebuild critical infrastructure in the region, as well as forcing Ukraine to divert resources to defend against these persistent attacks (3,7,9)."

Yaroslav Yanushevych, head of the Kherson region military administration, said that the Russians \"shelled the territory of Kherson region 61 times. The invaders attacked peaceful settlements of the region with artillery, MLRS, mortars and tanks.\" About half the strikes hit the city of Kherson, including private and apartment buildings, he said. One person was killed in action, while two residents of Kherson region sustained injuries. Russian shelling of Kherson city and areas along the Dnipro has been sustained since Ukrainian forces liberated the west bank in November. Serhiy Khlan, a member of Kherson regional council, said the number of attacks was increasing. \"The occupiers have now started using S-300 missiles and more precise rockets. They are destroying administrative buildings, shelling educational facilities, humanitarian aid centers,\" he said. \"The occupiers are randomly shelling residential areas of the city of Kherson with multiple rocket launchers,\" Khlan said. The strikes were also impeding efforts to restore power to the city. \"Within a month we have managed to restore almost 100% of electricity supply to Kherson region,\" he said. \"However, constant shelling, including of critical infrastructure, does not allow the city of Kherson to have permanent electricity supply.Kherson city is without electricity again,\" added Khlan. Ukrainian forces are retaliating and say they hit a concentration of Russian weaponry in the town of Kakhovka on the east bank. But they say the Russians are digging in along the west bank, creating fortifications. Khlan said that in a strip of land known as the Kinburn Spit, close to the Black Sea, the Russians are using mobile mortar groups that are difficult to hit. Yurii Sobolevskyi, first deputy head of Kherson regional council, said that occupying forces were taking harsher action against Ukrainian civilians still living in occupied areas of the region. \"Recently, the occupiers have carried out a series of filtration raids in the Henichesk district of Kherson region,\" he said, adding that they had been more aggressive than usual. Sobolevskyi claimed that Russian troops are \"experiencing mounting problems with morale and discipline.\"",

The Monroe County Department of Health then reviewed the samples and tests, and deemed the water safe to drink.\n\nHowever, work is still needed to repair the physical damage from the broken water main. Officials said drivers heading through the area of Ford and Favor Streets where the three-foot water main ruptured Wednesday evening should allow for extra time as road damage and repairs will impact traffic flow for at least the remainder of the holiday weekend.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC) Following a large water main break, the City of Rochester has issued a boil water advisory for a large portion of the city, likely in effect until Saturday December 24.\n\nThe break was repaired Friday afternoon, but water tests will continue through Saturday. As of Friday evening, city officials said water had been restored to all who were impacted, except one church.\n\nRepresentatives said all RCSD schools and buildings were closed on Thursday, December 22, and will remain closed on Friday, December 23, due to the water break. School-related activities are also canceled, staff is not expected to report, and no transportation will be provided.\n\nAt around 5 p.m. Wednesday a water main broke in the area of West Main Street and Ford Street, on Favor Street. The break impacted water pressure, meaning untreated water and harmful microbes have a chance to enter the water supply.\n\nMonroe County and New York State Departments of Health are warning residents to bring all water meant for the following tasks to a rolling boil, and boiling for one minute:\n\nWashing dishes\n\nEating\n\nBrushing teeth\n\nMaking ice\n\nPreparing food\n\nOfficials recommend boiling and cooling water before use, or purchasing bottled water certified for sale by the NY Department of Health. The advisory will be lifted when tests confirm any danger has passed.\n\nAs a result of the break, several homes are currently without water. The 36-inch water main was originally installed in 1899, and suffered an \"extensive\" break, officials said. At its peak, it was losing more than 35,000 gallons of water per minute.\n\nA pastor of the Greater Bethlehem Temple Pentecostal Church says she is concerned because the building sits below where the water was running off from the break, adding that it is historic property as it was a stop on the Underground Railroad through Rochester.\n\nFlooding near the intersection of Troup Street and Ford Street at 7:30 p.m. on December 21 (News 8 WROC)\n\nAccording to the Rochester Police Department, the area of Ford Street between West Main St. and Troup St. is anticipated to be closed to traffic for the majority of the day.\n\nAffected Areas\n\nGenesee River to Flint Street\n\nFlint Street to Genesee Street\n\nGenesee Street to Arnett Boulevard\n\nArnett Boulevard to Westfield Street\n\nWestfield Street to Chili Avenue\n\nChili Avenue to Lee Road\n\nLee Road to NYS Route 104\n\nNYS Route 104 to Genesee River\n\nGenesee River to Inner Loop\n\nInner Loop to University Avenue\n\nUniversity Avenue to North/South Goodman Street\n\nSouth Goodman Street to Linden Street\n\nLinden Street to Mount Hope Avenue\n\nMount Hope Avenue to McLean Street\n\nMcLean Street to Genesee River\n\nThis is a massive project for the @CityRochesterNY water.

Later Tuesday, the sheriffs website stated that \"multiple reports of additional injuries have been received and are being verified,\" but was not more specific.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff said there are widespread damages reported to roads and homes. Residents are being told to prepare for more aftershocks and check gas and water lines for damage and leaks.\n\nKRON ON is streaming live\n\nThe Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is working on responding to gas and electric hazards, checking equipment to minimize outages. This earthquake comes just days after a 3.6-magnitude earthquake hit El Cerrito, causing minor damage.",

He said crews have been working nonstop to stabilize the energy grid to restore heat and water supplies.\n\nThe most difficult situation, he said, is in \"Kyiv and the region, Vinnytsia and the region, Lviv and the region.\" But large-scale power outages are affecting many other regions, as well, including Dnipro and Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraines ambassador to the United States, told ABC Newss \"This Week\" show, \"We see what happens when we dont have enough air defense.\"\n\nMarkarova said half of Ukraines energy grid has been destroyed by Russian missiles. \"We have to stop it. And the only way to do it is with increased number of air defense everywhere in Ukraine,\" she said.\n\nU.S. officials say they are planning to send a Patriot missile air defense battery to Ukraine to help shoot down incoming Russian airstrikes, but no official announcement has been made. Russia has condemned the anticipated U.S. action and called it a provocation heightening U.S. involvement in the conflict.\n\nNonetheless, the United States will provide additional security assistance to Ukraine, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told VOA in an interview on Friday.\n\nAsked if Washington would heed Russias warning not to deliver sophisticated Patriot air defense missiles or risk the consequences, Kirby replied, \"Russia will not dictate to the United States or any other country what security assistance we provide to Ukraine.\"\n\nThe U.S. official said Washington is in \"lockstep with the Ukrainians, talking to them almost every day about what their needs are, and making sure that we are best meeting those needs.\"\n\nZelenskyy thanked the European Union and United States for decisions to provide defense, energy and financial support to Ukraine in the coming year. He added there is more to be done and urged \"a reliable air defense shield,\" that will protect the Ukrainian people from \"the main form of Russian terror missile terror.\"\n\nIn an intelligence update Saturday, Britains Defense Ministry said, \"In recent days, there has been an uptick in Russia's campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraine's critical national infrastructure.\"\n\nThe ministry tweeted, \"The waves of strikes have largely consisted of air and maritime launched cruise missiles but have almost certainly also included Iranian-provided unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being launched from Russia's Krasnodar Region.\"\n\nUkraine has said that restoring its pre-2014 border with Russia is its goal in defending against Russias nearly 10-month war, including retaking the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014.\n\nMarkarova acknowledged that \"taking everything back is difficult,\" but added, \"There is no other option.\"\n\nRussia last week announced the formation of creative brigades to boost the morale of troops on the front line, with plans to send opera singers, actors and circus performers. In a new intelligence update Sunday, however, the British defense ministry said that while \"fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force,\" the soldiers concerns lie elsewhere.\n\nThe ministry said, \"Soldiers concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war's objectives.\"\n\n\"The creative brigades' efforts are unlikely to substantively alleviate these concerns,\" the British report concluded.\n\nSome information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

The Russian leader was speaking at the start of the meeting with defence industry officials gathered from across the country in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing. Putin said: The most important key task of our military-industrial complex is to provide our units and frontline forces with everything they need: weapons, equipment, ammunition, and gear in the necessary quantities and of the right quality in the shortest possible timeframes. Its also important to perfect and significantly improve the technical characteristics of weapons and equipment for our fighters based on the combat experience we have gained. He added that he was looking forward to their \"proposals on addressing the problems that are inevitable in this large piece of work and how we will move forward and make sure there are fewer of them\". Putins remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russias top military officials. Speaking in Moscow at the closing session of the expanded board of the ministry of defence on Wednesday, he said there were no \"funding restrictions\" for the military. He added: The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything. Russia is expected to dramatically increase its spending on the military in the next two years, as Putin signals that he is preparing for a prolonged and costly war with Ukraine. Earlier this month, he said the conflict could turn into a \"long-term process\", and the Kremlin shows no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine.\n\n23 Dec 2022 12.56 EST Deeply personal Zelenskiy-Biden meeting cemented their bond, says top adviser Volodymyr Zelenskiys visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are \"strategic partners\" for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leaders most senior adviser has said in an interview on his return home. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan presidents office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiys bond with the US president, Joe Biden and with senior US Republicans, despite \"dirty\" comments made by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. US President Joe Biden welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the South Lawn at the White House in Washington. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters The summit and press conference between the two leaders this week demonstrated \"how deeply in personal attitude President Biden feels everything which is connected to Ukraine\", Yermak said, and that the US was \"a real leader of the free world and democracy\". Yermaks emphasis on the personal links forged by the surprise visit, the first time Zelenskiy had been outside Ukraine since the start of the war, comes despite a failure to immediately obtain the US Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range army tactical missile system ATACMS that Ukraine has said it needs to defeat Russia. But it demonstrates a belief in Kyiv that Ukraine must emphasise the moral dimension of its fight against the invading Russian army and its faith in its relationship with the US to unlock more and more of the military aid it badly needs as the war heads towards its first anniversary in February. Yermak, who was by Zelenskiys side during the trip, said: Its [the] first time in history that Ukraine and [the] United States are close as strategic partners. There is a very warm, very friendly relationship, [a] personal relationship between [the] two presidents. As well as the meeting with Biden, Yermak highlighted meetings Zelenskiy had with US congressional leaders, including those with senior Republicans Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, and Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate to become House speaker next month.

Speaking at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We are already rebooting relations with dozens of African countries. Next year, we have to strengthen them. Ten countries have already been designated in Africa where new embassies of Ukraine will be opened. There are also plans to develop a \"Ukraine-Africa trade house\" with offices in the capitals of \"the most promising countries\" on the African continent, he added.

Iran (drones/missiles), North Korea (ammunition/weapons), Belarus (infrastructure/territory/equipment). Factually & legally confirmed allies of RF in the war of aggression, mass murders of civilians & deliberate destruction of Ukrainian cities. There will be joint accountability. (@Podolyak_M) December 23, 2022 Podolyaks tweet came a day after the White House accused North Korea of supplying arms to the private Russian mercenary firm the Wagner Group to help bolster Moscows troops in Ukraine. Kyiv has accused Tehran of supplying thousands of its drones to Moscow, which used them in deadly attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. After initially denying the presence of Iranian drones in Ukraine, the Tehran government has admitted that it had supplied a \"small number\" of the unmanned aircraft to Russia months before Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight.\n\nUpdated at 11.36 EST\n\n23 Dec 2022 11.07 EST Russia accused of demolishing Mariupol theatre to hide war crimes Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the citys exiled Ukrainian mayor. Petro Andryushchenko accused the occupying authorities of attempting to cover up the Russian bombing of the theatre, which was being used as an air raid shelter when it was hit on 16 March. An investigation by Amnesty International into the Mariupol theatre strike concluded that Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there. Video posted on social media appears to show diggers demolishing the last remaining walls of the theatre. Ukraines culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an \"attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians\". Drama Theater in Mariupol does no longer exist. This is attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by russians.

The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the groups expanding role in the war. Pyongyangs transaction with the Wagner Group \"clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions\", Canadas foreign ministry said. Mlanie Joly, Canadas foreign minister, said in a statement: We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place. The Wagner groups owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied the White Houses accusation as \"gossip and speculation\". North Koreas foreign ministry also denied it had supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner.\n\nUpdated at 10.55 EST\n\n23 Dec 2022 10.18 EST Lorenzo Tondo If one battle more than any other has defined the brutality of Russias war in Ukraine, it is the three-month siege of Mariupols steelworks this spring, and the harrowing experience of its last defenders. Holed up in Azovstal, one of Europes largest metal-producing plants, hundreds of outnumbered, outgunned, wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers, and more than 1,000 civilians, resisted one of Moscows fiercest military attacks for more than 80 days. \"No one came out of there unchanged,\" says Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name. They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out. Injured soldier Mykhailo Dianov inside the Azovstal steelworks in May. He is now safe in the US. Photograph: Dmytro Orest Kozatskyi/AFP/Getty Images Soon after the Russian invasion in late February, Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as \"apocalyptic\". The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 22,000 people died during the fighting. Some survivors took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks, an industrial site covering an area of about four square miles, including a network of underground tunnels. With the civilians were about 3,000 soldiers, many of whom were members of the notorious Azov brigade, which, at its inception in 2014, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, but for President Vladimir Putin it was the perfect propaganda opportunity to convince the public that his narrative about the \"nazification\" of Ukraine was true, and that his army would hunt them down like rats. Never would Putin have imagined that the last defenders of Mariupol would defy his plan for so long. Cut off from the world and low on food, the defenders of Azovstal were holed up in the tunnels of the steelworks for over two months while the Russians launched rockets and incendiary bombs at the site.

(@Hromadske) December 23, 2022\n\n23 Dec 2022 08.13 EST A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putins use of the word \"war\" to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin yesterday publicly acknowledged the situation as a \"war\" for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a \"special military operation\". In March, Putin formally signed a law that would impose harsh jail terms for people who intentionally spread \"fake\" information about Russias armed forces, including calling the war by its name. But the Russian leader said at a news conference on Thursday: Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of a military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war. This is what we are striving for. Nikita Yuferev, an opposition councillor in St Petersburg, has asked prosecutors to investigate Putin for using the word \"war\", and accused the president of breaking his own law. In an open letter, he asked the prosecutor general and interior minister to \"hold (Putin) responsible under the law for spreading fake news about the actions of the Russian army\". He told Reuters that he knew his legal challenge would go nowhere, but he had filed it to expose the \"mendacity\" of the system. Yuferev said: Its important for me to do this to draw attention to the contradiction and the injustice of these laws that he (Putin) adopts and signs but which he himself doesnt observe. I think the more we talk about this, the more people will doubt his honesty, his infallibility, and the less support he will have.",

While GlobalSecurity.org takes utmost care to accurately report this news story, we cannot independently verify the authenticity of all statements, photos and videos.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Ukraine was suddenly and deliberately attacked by land, naval and air forces of Russia, igniting the largest European war since the Great Patriotic War. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" (SVO - spetsialnaya voennaya operatsiya) in Ukraine in response to the appeal of the leaders of the \"Donbass republics\" for help. That attack is a blatant violation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Putin stressed that Moscow's goal is the demilitarization and denazification of the country. The military buildup in preceeding months makes it obvious that the unprovoked and dastardly Russian attack was deliberately planned long in advance. During the intervening time, the Russian government had deliberately sought to deceive the world by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\n\n\"To initiate a war of aggression... is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\" [Judgment of the International Military Tribunal]\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence reported that on 21 December, President Putin was presented with plans to expand the Russian military by around 30% to 1.5 million personnel. It isn't clear when this level would be achieved.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shigou explained that the expansion would involve at least two brigades in north-western Russia growing to divisional strength. He cited the supposed threat from Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO.\n\nThis constitutes one of the first insights into how Russia aspires to adapt its forces to the long-term strategic challenges resulting from its invasion of Ukraine. It remains unclear how Russia will find the recruits to complete such an expansion at a time when its forces are under unprecedented pressure in Ukraine.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that during the day, Russian forces launched 1 missile, 4 air strikes, and also carried out 16 MLRS attacks.\n\nRussia has increased the volume of railway transport of personnel, military equipment and ammunition to the areas of hostilities. Russia continues to focus its efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Lyman, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka areas. On Kupiansk - trying to improve the tactical position. On Novopavlivsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - it is being defended.\n\nThere is still a threat of air and missile strikes on critical infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine.\n\nIn the Volyn, Polissya, Siverskyi and Slobozhanskyi directions, the situation has not changed significantly, and no signs of the formation of offensive groups of the Russian forces have been detected. The Russian occupiers plan to deploy a field hospital on the territory of belarus.\n\nAreas of fifteen settlements were hit by tank, mortar and artillery shelling in the Slobozhanskyi direction. Among them are Hoptivka, Kudiivka, Krasne, Zelene, Hatyshche, Vovchansk, Varvarivka, Zybyne, Dvorichna and Zemlyanka of the Kharkiv oblast.\n\nIn the Kupyansk direction, Russian forces shelled the areas of fourteen settlements. In particular, these are Vyshneve, Ivanivka, Zapadne, Kupyansk and Synkivka in the Kharkiv oblast and Kislivka, Yahidne, Kotlyarivka, Kuzemivka and Kolomiychykha in the Luhansk oblast.\n\nIn the Lyman direction, the Russian occupiers again inflicted fire damage on the areas of Makiivka, Ploshchanka, Chervonopopivka, and Dibrova in the Luhansk oblast.\n\nIn the direction of Bakhmut, Russian forces shelled the districts of twenty-two settlements. Among them are Bilohorivka, Yakovlivka, Bakhmut, Klishchiivka, Bila Hora, Kurdyumivka, Druzhba, Zalizne and Vesele of the Donetsk oblast. In addition, airstrikes were recorded near Spirne and Bilohorivka.\n\nVodyane, Pervomaiske, Nevelske and Maryinka in Donetsk oblast were affected by Russian fire in the Avdiiv district.\n\nIn the direction of Novopavlivsk, Russian forces fired tanks and artillery at the districts of Paraskoviivka, Vuhledar, Zolota Nyva, and Velyka Novosilka of the Donetsk oblast.\n\nIn the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson directions, the Russian occupiers continue to terrorize civilians living along the right bank of the Dnipro River. More than forty settlements were shelled by rocket and barrel artillery. In particular, these are Zaliznychne, Charivne, Orihiv, Mahdalynivka, and Kamianske in the Zaporizhzhia oblast, and Kherson, Respublikanets, Dniprovske, Yantarne, Bilozerka, and Stanislav in the Kherson oblast. Russian forces also carried out an airstrike near Kamianske.\n\nIn order to strengthen administrative and police measures in the temporarily occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia oblast, about 500 servicemen from the Russian Guard arrived in the city of Berdyansk.\n\nDuring the day, the Ukrainian aviation carried out 7 strikes on areas where the Russian forces' personnel, weapons and military equipment were concentrated. And Ukrainian units of missile troops and artillery hit 2 control points, 2 ammunition warehouses and 11 areas of concentration of the Russian occupiers' manpower. Information on Russian losses is being clarified.\n\nStatements of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense in a daily briefing reported that strongholds in the areas of Kislovka, Krakhmalnoye and Berestovoye (Kharkov region) in the Kupyansk direction were hit during the day. More than 30 Ukrainian servicemen, 2 infantry fighting vehicles and 4 vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIn the Limansky direction in the areas of Nevsky and Novolyubovka (Lugansk People's Republic, LPR), strikes were made on accumulations of manpower and equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the areas of the tract Medvezhye and Serebryansky forestry, 2 sabotage and reconnaissance groups were destroyed. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine amounted to more than 40 military personnel and mercenaries, 3 armored vehicles and 2 pickup trucks.\n\nStrongholds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were hit in the Donetsk and South-Donetsk directions, about 125 Ukrainian servicemen and mercenaries, 2 tanks, 5 armored vehicles, 4 armored personnel carriers, 6 cars and 3 pickup trucks were destroyed.\n\nAviation, missile forces and artillery hit 62 artillery units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, manpower and military equipment in 87 districts, 2 artillery ammunition depots. In the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), a US-made AN / TPQ-50 counter-battery warfare station was destroyed, in the Kharkov region - a radar station of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system.\n\nDuring the counter-battery fight in the DPR, 2 artillery systems M777, 2 Ukrainian combat vehicles of the Grad multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) were destroyed, from which the settlements of the republic were shelled.\n\nFighter aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down a Su-25 aircraft and a Mi-8 helicopter of the Ukrainian Air Force in the DPR. 10 unmanned aerial vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were destroyed by means of air defense, 2 shells of MLRS HIMARS were intercepted.\n\nZaporozhye region\n\nThe authorities of the Zaporozhye region do not see the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for an offensive, and the RF Armed Forces have enough forces and means to hold the front. This was stated by the Acting Governor of the region Yevgeny Balitsky.\n\nThe official also said that the shelling of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant by the Armed Forces of Ukraine had practically ceased, the situation around the plant was completely controlled. 2 reactors operate at the facility - mainly for heat energy, which is necessary to provide Energodar with heat. Balitsky added that the authorities of the region hope for the complete liberation of the region from Ukrainian troops.\n\nA car exploded in the center of Melitopol during the day, 2 people were injured as a result of the incident. According to Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the regional administration, the incident is classified as a terrorist attack, behind which Ukrainian militants stand.\n\nDPR\n\nDuring the day, Ukrainian troops opened fire on Donetsk, as well as the settlements of Gorlovka, Makeyevka, Mayorsk, Kashtanovoe, Krasny Partizan, Yasinovataya, and Shirokaya Balka. As a result of attacks in Horlivka, residential buildings were damaged.\n\nAndrey Baevsky, an officer of the People's Militia of the DPR, said that the intensity of shelling of the central regions of Donetsk by the Armed Forces of Ukraine has noticeably decreased. According to the soldier, this is primarily due to the success of the Allied forces in the counter-battery fight.\n\nLC\n\nAndrey Marochko, an officer of the People's Militia of the LPR, said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are deploying engineering units reinforced with armored vehicles to the Liman direction. In addition, in the area of responsibility of the 2nd Army Corps of the LPR, an increase in the conduct of electronic intelligence by Ukrainian formations was noted.\n\nThe commander of the battalion of the 2nd Corps with the call sign Chechen said that Kyiv was transferring Western mercenaries to the Lisichansk Front against the backdrop of the flight of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from positions. According to the battalion commander, the Ukrainian military cannot withstand the tension, they are being replaced by mercenaries from NATO countries and militants of the national battalions.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",

A day later, so did Kherson.\n\nThousands of Russian troops, sweeping up from the Crimean Peninsula on Feb. 24, captured the city on the Dnieper River so rapidly that many residents say they felt abandoned by the Ukrainian military and its quick withdrawal, leaving the city without an adequate defense.\n\nBut was the doomed stand in Lilac Park a futile, early act of resistance to what became a bloody Russian occupation of Kherson? Was it due to the hasty retreat by Ukraine's military so it could regroup to fight another day indeed later retaking the city in November? Or was it the result of a betrayal by high-level Ukrainian security officials collaborating with Moscow?\n\nIt's possible it was a combination of all of those.\n\nNow that Russia has retreated from Kherson following Ukraine's counteroffensive in the south, residents want to know why Moscow's forces were able to overrun the city so easily.\n\n\"There are more questions than answers to this story,\" said Svetlana Shornik, standing at her ex-husband's grave for the first time because the Russians had blocked access to the cemetery while they had occupied the city.\n\nBesides the volunteers killed in the park, about five others were slain that day at a roundabout nearby.\n\nFamilies of the dead say they have been trying in vain for months to get information from the military and the government so they can have some closure about the deaths of their loved ones.\n\n\"I know very little,\" said Nadiia Khandusenko, recounting what few facts she knows about the death of her husband, Serhii, who also was killed in Lilac Park.",

According to the Washington Post, around 100,000 service members have been killed or wounded. Many Ukrainian soldiers have lost limbs. Their country does not have the funds or the expertise to equip its growing number of amputees with prosthetics, so they are turning to Western countries for help.\n\nCharitable donations have been pouring in allowing Ukrainian soldiers access to state-of-the-art prosthetics equipment. The Washington Post accompanied three Ukrainian soldiers in a U.S. rehabilitation center near Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland.\n\nThe support Ukrainian personnel have received reflects significant advancements in combat medicine made by the United States and NATO allies over 20 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n10:15 a.m.: Ukraines presidential office is criticizing FIFA for refusing to air a message from President Volodymyr Zelensky in Qatars Lusail Stadium ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday.\n\nThe video, which was recorded in English, is meant to be an \"appeal for peace,\" Ukraines presidential office said in a written statement to CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"Qatar supported the Presidents initiative, but FIFA blocked the initiative and will not allow the video address of the president to be shown before the final game,\" the statement said.\n\nCNN reached out to FIFA but has not received a comment. The world football governing body has gone to extreme lengths to keep political messaging out of its showcase tournament in Qatar, the first Middle Eastern nation to ever stage the event.\n\nQatar has not publicly commented on the request from Ukraine.\n\n9:45 a.m.: Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu inspected the country's troops involved in Moscow's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, the Russian defense ministry said on Sunday.\n\n\"The head of the Russian military flew around the areas of deployment of troops and checked the advanced positions of Russian units in the zone of the special military operation,\" the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nMoscow calls its invasion in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" to \"demilitarize\" and \"denazify\" its neighbor. Kyiv and its allies call it an unprovoked act of conquest.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the ministry said in the statement that Shoigu spoke with troops \"on the frontline\" and at a \"command post.\" However, it was not immediately clear when the visit took place or if Shoigu had visited Ukraine itself.\n\nA short video posted with the statement showed Shoigu in a military helicopter and a couple of aerial shots of empty swaths of land.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after Russia's President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with the country's top military leaders, including Shoigu, seeking proposals on how they think Russia's military campaign in Ukraine should proceed.\n\nThe conflict, Europe's deadliest since World War II, has killed thousands, displaced millions, and turned cities to rubble.\n\n9:15 a.m.: The time is coming for a negotiated peace in Ukraine to reduce the risk of another devastating world war, but dreams of breaking up Russia could unleash nuclear chaos, veteran U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger said.\n\n\"A peace process should link Ukraine to NATO, however expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,\" Kissinger wrote in the Spectator magazine in an article entitled \"How to avoid another world war.\"\n\nThe Kremlin says Kyiv must acknowledge Moscow's annexation of southern and eastern regions. Ukraine says every Russian soldier must leave its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Kyiv applied to join NATO after Moscow announced the annexations in September.\n\nCIA director Bill Burns said in an interview with PBS published on Saturday, while most conflicts end in negotiation, the CIA's assessment was Russia was not serious yet about a real negotiation to end the war.\n\nUkraine and the West say Putin has no justification for what they cast as an imperial-style war of occupation.\n\n8:40 a.m.: Russian military forces have shelled the center of Kherson. The city was liberated after Russian soldiers withdrew last month in one of Moscows biggest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine. Three people were wounded in the attacks, said presidential deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko. The southern city and its surrounding region have come under frequent attack since the Russian pullback.\n\nRegional governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said Sunday that Russia carried out 54 attacks with rocket, mortar and tank fire over the previous day, killing three people and wounding six, The Associated Press reported.\n\n7:45 a.m.: One person was killed and at least four people were wounded by Ukrainian shelling in the southern Russian region of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine on Sunday, the governor of the region said, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Our air defense system was activated over Belgorod and the Belgorod region,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\n\"Four people are known to have been injured. Medical teams are taking them to hospital,\" he said.\n\nA poultry plant has been damaged and windows in several residential buildings and cars have been hit, he added.\n\nThree witnesses told Reuters that loud blasts were heard in the city on Sunday.\n\nBelgorod is one of several southern Russian regions where targets such as fuel and ammunition stores have been rocked by explosions since the start of what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\n5:20 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that a New York Times investigation of Russian military documents from early in the war supports ISWs longstanding assessments about how flawed Russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued Russias invasion of Ukraine from its onset.\n\nUkrainian forces conducted counterattacks near Svatove and Kreminna and continue to strike Russian rear areas, the assessment said, while Russian forces continued offensive operations near Bakhmut and Avdiivka-Donetsk City. Ukrainian officials warned that Russian forces may be attempting to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east bank of the Dnipro River.\n\n4:11 a.m.: The Kyiv Independent reported that Austria has adopted a resolution callling the Holodomor, a Soviet-created famine in the 1930s, a \"terrible crime.\" The resolution also notes the \"use of hunger as a weapon in the current Russian war against Ukraine.\"\n\n3:06 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said Russia is attempting to shore up its troops' morale with music and entertainment for troops. \"However,\" the update noted, \"soldiers concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the wars objectives. The creative brigades efforts are unlikely to substantively alleviate these concerns.\"\n\n2:07 a.m.: Moscow is trying to seize more territory in Ukraine's Donetsk region, currently one of the war's hottest areas. Russian forces are said to be sending small reconnaissance units to probe for weaknesses in Ukraine's defenses. Despite being outgunned, Ukrainian troops are pushing back against enemy attacks. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n12:02 a.m.: The Kyiv Independent tweets: CIA Director: China has been paying close attention' to Russia's poor military performance. CIA Director Bill Burns told PBS that no other foreign leader \"has paid more careful attention to that war and Russia's poor military performance than Xi Jinping has.\"\n\nSome information came from Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press and Reuters.",

The 67-year-old has been the target of intensive criticism from hawkish commentators, who have accused him of being too cautious.\n\nAir Force General Sergei Surovikin who was appointed as Russias commander in Ukraine in October was also present at the meeting, photos released by state media showed.\n\nThe meeting followed claims by the commander of Ukraines military, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, that Moscow could seek to launch a new offensive in early 2023. He warned that Russia was preparing around 200,000 troops for the attack.\n\n\"I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv,\" he added. \"I know how many combat units I have right now, how many combat units I have to create by the end of the year and, most importantly, not to touch them in any way now. No matter how hard it is.\"\n\nHe added that the attack could originate \"in the direction of Kyiv\" and may be launched from Belarus.\n\nIn February, Russian troops advanced towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after crossing the border from Belarus.\n\nWhile the countrys leader Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that his forces will join in the invasion, thousands of Russian troops are currently in the country taking part in what Moscows defence ministry called \"intensive combat training\".\n\nMr Putin will visit his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk on Monday.\n\nBut analysts have questioned Russias ability to launch a new offensive on the Ukrainian capital, and White House spokesperson John Kirby said that US intelligence officials \"arent seeing any indication that theres an imminent move on Kyiv\".\n\nSenior US defence officials told the Reuters news agency that Russia had been forced to use decades-old ammunition with high failure rates as it burns through its supplies.\n\nThey added that \"the rate of fire that Russia has been using its artillery and rocket ammunition\" could see them run out of reliable munitions by early 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian workers have spent much of Saturday trying to restore power supplies after a wave of Russian strikes hit the countrys energy grid on Friday.\n\nPart of Kyiv remained without power, but mayor Vitali Klitschko said the citys metro system had restarted and the water supply had been restored.\n\nHe also posted photos on Telegram of a large Christmas tree thats been adapted to meet the constraints of a wartime winter. The tree will be lit with energy-saving bulbs run off a generator, he said.\n\nPower has been restored in the countrys second city of Kharkiv, authorities said, after it was left without electricity for hours following Fridays wave of strikes that targeted energy stations across the country.\n\nRussia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones since the wave of strikes on power infrastructure began on 10 October. International leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron have said the strikes amount to a war crime.\n\nThe UKs Ministry of Defence says there had been an \"uptick\" in Russias campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraines critical infrastructure in recent days.",

For example, in the city of Starobilsk, Luhansk region, in the military hospital equipped by the occupiers, about 50 seriously wounded enemy servicemen have recently been delivered. In the city of Horlivka, Donetsk region, due to the lack of donor blood, all employees of medical institutions were obliged to donate blood according to the established schedule. {The damage to the invaders manpower and equipment in the previous days has been confirmed.

[]\n\nIt is not clear how many of the Iskander systems which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons have been deployed to Belarus after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that Moscow would supply Minsk with them and the air defence systems.\"\n\nAccording to British Defence Intelligence, (last 24 hours):\n\nRussian forces have largely focused on constructing defensive positions along many sections of the front line in Ukraine since October. This includes laying additional fields of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, almost certainly going beyond Russian doctrinal guidelines.\n\nalong many sections of the front line in Ukraine since October. This includes laying additional fields of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, almost certainly going beyond Russian doctrinal guidelines. Minefields only present an effective obstacle for trained troops if covered by observation and fire. A major challenge for the Russian forces will likely be a shortage of surveillance assets and trained personnel to effectively monitor large areas of the new minefields.\n\nLosses of the Russian army\n\nAs of Monday 26 December, the approximate losses of weapons and military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces from the beginning of the invasion to the present day:\n\nPersonnel about 102600 (+550),\n\nTanks 3016 (+5),\n\nArmored combat vehicles 6017 (+7),\n\nArtillery systems 1996 (+5),\n\nMultiple rocket launchers MLRS 418 (+0),\n\nAir defence means 212 (+0),\n\nAircraft 283 (+0),\n\nHelicopters 267 (+0),\n\nAutomotive technology and fuel tanks 4647 (+12),\n\nVessels/boats 16 (+0),\n\nUAV operational and tactical level 1707 (+1),\n\nSpecial equipment 178 (+0),\n\nMobile SRBM system 4 (+0),\n\nCruise missiles 653 (+0)\n\nRussian enemy suffered the greatest losses (of the last day) in the Kupiansk, Avdiivka, and Bakhmut directions.\n\nRussians lost thousands of soldiers at Bakhmut, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Serhii Haidai, Head of Luhansk Oblast Military Administration. \"As for Bakhmut, it is no longer even a strategic military plan, although there is such a thing, but a rather symbolic matter, which the Kremlin regime loves very much.\n\nPlus, the Kadyrovites [the Chechen forces led by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and fighting as part of the Russian army -ed.] and Wagnerites [and inmates recruited by Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the founder of the Wagner Group private military company -ed.] want to prove themselves and show the bunker grandpa[Putin] that they are capable of something. But so far, they are losing thousands of their soldiers, who stay there for life.\"\n\nPutin still tells tales of 99.9% of Russians \"ready to put everything on the line for Motherland\", Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the vast majority of Russians are ready to \"put everything on the line\" for the sake of their country.\n\nIt simply reassures me once again that Russia is a special country. And special people live here. According to him, this is allegedly confirmed throughout the entire history of Russias existence, and once again today.\"\n\nDuma prepares higher taxation for Russians who left country (which is ironic in view of Putins claim above), Reuters reports. \"Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Duma, said the Russian lower house of parliament was preparing a law to introduce higher taxation for people who have left the country, as many have since the war in Ukraine began in February. It is right to cancel preferences for those who have left the Russian Federation and to introduce an increased tax rate for them, Volodin wrote on the Telegram messaging app. We are working on appropriate changes to the legislation.\n\nThe number of Russians who have left since the start of the war is unclear. By early October, some local media had reported that as many as 700,000 had fled following the September announcement of a mobilisation drive to call up as many as 300,000 to fight. The government rejected that figure at the time.\"\n\nHumanitarian\n\nRussians hold people at Vasylivka checkpoint, Zaporizhzhia Oblast for ten days, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Ivan Fedorov, Mayor of Melitopol. \"The Ruscists made a reservation out of the occupied territories and are holding people hostage. For the last 10 days, the Russians have not released residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts leaving towards the city of Zaporizhzhia through Vasylivka checkpoint.\n\nAccording to the mayor, over the course of 10 months, the occupiers intensified terror and made evacuation difficult; they artificially created thousands of queues at checkpoints and introduced a system of special travel passes, for which it was necessary to wait up to a month at the occupation commandants office.\n\nA month ago, the invaders stopped releasing men fit for military service, and now they are not releasing even children, women, and the elderly. For people who want to drive through, the invaders offer to leave their cars and go to Zaporizhzhia on foot. The occupiers note that the road is closed until January 15.\"\n\nMore than 15M tonnes of grain exported from Ukrainian ports Turkish defense minister, Ukrinform reports. \"Thanks to the work of the Joint Coordination Center established in Istanbul, more than 15 million tonnes of food were safely sent from Ukrainian ports to countries in need. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said this during a trip to Gaziantep province, Ukrinform reports, citing DHA.\n\nOn November 17 in Istanbul, Ukraine, the United Nations and Trkiye agreed to extend the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports (the Black Sea Grain Initiative) for another 120 days. The initiative was launched on July 22, and the first vessel with Ukrainian grain left the port of Odesa on August 1.\"\n\nLegal\n\nRussian Army destroys church in Kherson Oblast, Euromaidan Press reports. \"Attacks of Russian troops which target religious buildings in Ukraine violate international laws, Ukraines Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Christmas Day on 25 December.\n\nThe only Kyselivka village (Kherson Oblast) church was fully destroyed by Russian shelling. The Hague Convention IV protects religious buildings during hostilities, but for Russian war criminals there is no God, nor any respect for religion, the minister wrote on Twitter.\"\n\nTwo hospitals hit in Russias deadly attack on Kherson, Ukrinform reports, citing by Kherson Regional Military Administration Head, Yaroslav Yanushevych. \"Two hospitals were hit in Russias deadly attack on the city of Kherson yesterday. Fortunately, no casualties were reported.\n\nRashists continue to attack hospitals in the Kherson region. These are deliberate terrorist attacks on the facilities providing aid to civilians. Yesterday, the enemy struck two health facilities in Kherson, Yanushevych wrote.\"\n\n450 children were killed, 867 children injured the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reports as of period 16-23 December. 3,126 educational establishments are damaged as a result of shelling and bombings, 337 of them are destroyed fully. 56,330 crimes of aggression and war crimes, and 18,404 crimes against national security were registered.\n\nSupport\n\nBolting random weapons on random chassis, the Ukrainian army proves its ingenuity and desperation, Forbes reported on 19 December. \"A slightly odd-looking Ukrainian infantry fighting vehicle, churning through the cold mud thats typical of Ukraines early winters, tells a profound story. One of desperation. And improvisation. The Ukrainian military and its supporting industry for months have been taking bits and pieces of wrecked armored vehicles and combining them with museum-quality antique weapons and even pickup trucks. The result is a dizzying array of improvised armour, rocket-launchers and air-defense systems. Each the military equivalent of Frankensteins monster.\n\nSome obviously work just fine. Some probably dont. All are indicative of Ukrainian ingenuity. But they also underscore vexing shortages in the Ukrainian arsenalshortages that Ukraines foreign allies are unwilling or unable to fill as Russias wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 10th month. []\n\nDespite the shortfall, Ukraines NATO allies have donated just a few hundred IFVsall of them BMPs. Ukraine hasnt received a single non-Soviet IFV from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or any other ally.\n\nInstead, NATO countries have sent to Ukraine a thousand lightly-armed APCsM-113s, mostlythat each can carry a squad of infantry but generally lack turrets and cannons. They can carry, but they cant fight. Yes, the M-113 is fast and reliable. But all those APCs filling in for IFVs could represent risk for Ukrainian heavy brigadesand likely explain the enduring demand for Frankenstein fighting vehicles.\n\nIts safe to assume that, if the Ukrainians were getting hundreds of second-hand M-2s from the Americans or Marders from the Germans, they wouldnt bother welding BMP turrets to PRP-3/4 hulls. But those M-2s and Marders arent forthcomingand its difficult to explain why. Many NATO armies are in the process of replacing their older IFVs with new designs or, owing to post-Cold War force-structure cuts, are sitting on huge reserves of idle IFVs.\n\nNATO countries seem to be answering a logistical impulse. They want to equip the Ukrainian army with the fewest possible different vehicles. By that rationale, its better for the United States and Germany both to offer up M-113s than for the Americans and Germans separately to pledge M-2s and Marders. One supply chain versus two.\n\nBut in the case of armored vehicles, that logistical standardization comes at the cost of combat capability. Ask Ukrainian commanders which trade-off they favor. They might not always ask for simpler logistics. If simplicity were their priority, they wouldnt be bolting random rockets and guns onto whatever wheeled or tracked chassis they can get their hands on.\"\n\nThe military balance 10 months into the full-scale war, reported by Volodymyr Dacenko, analyst and a columnist in Forbes Ukraine. This is a comparison of the available military power of Ukraine and Russia (according to open-source data). Although the mobilization did not go well in Russia, the Russians managed to saturate the front line and complicate the advance of the Armed Forces. The new mobilized who arrive at the front are already better prepared than the first batches. They are, however, equally poorly equipped\n\nIn general, the gap between Ukraine and Russia in military power is gradually decreasing. This is a consequence of disparity in battlefield losses, Russian defense industries limited ability to replace equipment lost due to sanctions, and not least, because of Western-supplied defense aid to Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, Ukraine has received a high number of war trophies. Russia is the main supplier of heavy weapons to Ukraine (at least tanks and armored vehicles).\n\nWhile Russias \"generosity\" is welcome, Ukraine needs more modern weapons. Most heavy weapons received from Western partners (and Russia) are Soviet legacy systems. The parity in technology helps turn the war into a war of attrition rather than modern, manoeuvre warfare. Russia cannot be defeated by numbers, but by quality. Ukraine needs a technological advantage to succeed. Introducing the American M-60 and M-1 Abrams or the German Leopard-1 and Leopard-2 would give Ukraine an advantage on the battlefield.\n\nRussia has been forced to change its tactics several times. Initially, Russia attempted a \"Blitzkrieg\" using heavy armoured vehicles. This summer, they abandoned their traditional Battalion Tactical Group concept and began using groups of armoured vehicles and infantry for attacks. Now, the assault is mainly carried out by infantry units supported by artillery (as in World War I).\n\nUkraine, on the contrary, uses more armoured vehicles during its counter-offensive. It is, however, lacking both armoured vehicles and main battle tanks in the numbers needed to breakthrough and rout Russian forces.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, recently stated that Ukraine needs 300 tanks, approximately 700 infantry fighting vehicles, and 500 howitzers to be able to achieve the next major objective.\n\nArtillery is becoming a problem for Russia. Considering the tens of millions of old Soviet shells, Russia will not run out of artillery ammunition anytime soon. According to Volodymyr Dacenko, they are, however, running out of ammunition for the attack at a distance of more than 20 km.\n\nPresently, Ukraine is probably dominating at range between 20-80 km, while Russia dominates ranges below and beyond. Ukrainian supplies of 155mm shells and GMLRS are, however, limited. It needs longer-range capabilities to destroy the Russians logistics nodes in the rear. The destruction of Russian logistics is one of the main premises for both preserving lives and military capabilities as well as conducting counteroffensive.\n\nUkraines Foreign Minister convinced that its only matter of time till Ukraine receives all necessary weapons, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is convinced that Ukraine will eventually receive all the weapons it needs from its partners. This is my impression. If we sum up all the behind-the-scenes conversations, not just in Washington, D.C., but also in other countries, the conclusion is this: all the necessary weapons will be made available, its only a matter of time.\n\nWhy cannot the weapons be provided immediately? There are psychological, logistical, and political reasons. But we have to work with all these barriers, and we will. It is not just a matter of reluctance.\n\nThe supply of any weapon is a very complex technical and logistics operation, we are dealing with all of these details jointly with colleagues from other government agencies I have a definite feeling, a finger-tips feeling so to say, that the matter of weapons supply has no taboos. And the best testament to that are the Patriots [air-defence systems].\"\n\nSupport for Ukraines energy sector from international partners reached almost $1.5B, Ukrinform reports, citing Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \"Assistance to the energy sector from partners is gaining momentum. We have almost $1.5 billion in declared support. Additional equipment is arriving every day to repair damaged infrastructure. More than 200 cargoes of energy equipment have already arrived, the report said.\n\nShmyhal recalled that the state would allocate UAH 150 million to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs for investment projects in the field of energy saving and energy supply. Also, last week the Government of Ukraine allocated UAH 400 million to businesses as part of the eRobota project.\"\n\nNew developments\n\nUkraine will create its own Christmas miracle, Zelenskyy says in defiant message, Reuters reports. \"Ukrainians will create their own miracle this Christmas by showing they remain unbowed despite Russian attacks that have plunged millions into darkness, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a defiant message on Saturday. Speaking 10 months to the day since Russian launched a war that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions more, Zelenskyy said that while freedom came at a high price, slavery would cost even more.\" Putin boasts that situation with war in Ukraine \"not as dangerous\" for Russia, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing RIA Novosti and RBC. \"Putins response when asked whether Russia is approaching a dangerous point in the war against Ukraine: \"Well, I dont think its that dangerous.\" The Russian president alleged once again that, by attacking Ukraine, he was acting the right way, defending the national interests, the interests of citizens and people, and that there was simply no other choice. [] At the same time, [] alleged that he was ready to negotiate on acceptable terms with all the participants in this process, but this is a matter for Ukraine and the West to consider.\" Putin says Russia ready to negotiate over Ukraine, Kyiv says Moscow doesnt want talks, Reuters reports. \"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are, Putin told Rossiya 1 state television. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin needed to return to reality and acknowledge it was Russia which did not want talks. \"Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,\" the adviser, Mykhailo Podoliak, tweeted. Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.\" Russia to supply Iran with 24 Su-35 aircraft i24NEWS, Euromaidan Press reports. \"Russia will soon supply Iran with a full squadron of advanced Sukhoy Su-35 multirole fighter jets, the Israeli-based news television channel i24NEWS reported referring to unnamed Western intelligence sources who monitor security deals between Iran and Russia. It will apparently be 24 Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets, originally produced for Egypt under a deal that was torpedoed by the United States. The Russians were looking for buyers for the unsold surplus, and it looks like Tehran will be getting those planes very soon. According to an intelligence report, Iranian pilots are already training on these planes, i24NEWS says.\"\n\nAssessment\n\nOn the War\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has made the following assessment as of Saturday 24 December:\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives Eastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast) Russian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Kreminna-Svatove line on December 24. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Andriivka, Luhansk Oblast (15km west of Svatove). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Stelmakhivka (16km northwest of Svatove) and in the direction of Nadiia (16km west of Svatove). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces have transitioned from offensive operations to positional battles near Dvorichna (55km northwest of Svatove). Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Makiivka (23km northwest of Kreminna) and in the area of Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna) and that there are positional battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna). One Russian milblogger claimed on December 23 that Russian forces are now at a distance close enough to Makiivka to effectively use small-arms fire against Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces also conducted assaults in the direction of Yampolivka, Donetsk Oblast (17km west of Kreminna) and near Bilohorivka (12km south of Kreminna). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted an assault in the vicinity of Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna). Ukrainian forces continued to strike Russian rear areas on December 24. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck Polovynkyne, Luhansk Oblast (56km southeast of Svatove) with HIMARS rockets. Social media sources posted footage indicating that Ukrainian forces reportedly struck an unspecified warehouse in Polovynkyne. Russian forces rate of advance in the Bakhmut area has likely slowed in recent days, although it is too early to assess whether the Russian offensive to capture Bakhmut has culminated. Russian milbloggers acknowledged that Ukrainian forces in the Bakhmut area have managed to slightly slow down the pace of the Russian advance around Bakhmut and its surrounding settlements, with one claiming that Ukrainian forces pushed back elements of the Wagner Group to positions they held days ago. Ukrainian social media sources previously claimed that Ukrainian forces completely pushed Russian forces out of the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut around December 21. ISW has also assessed that Russian forces made slightly fewer overall advances in the Bakhmut area in November and December combined as compared to the month of October. Russian forces will likely struggle to maintain the pace of their offensive operations in the Bakhmut area and may seek to initiate a tactical or operational pause. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UK MoD) reported on December 24 that Russian forces currently lack the necessary stockpile of artillery munitions to support large-scale offensive operations and that sustaining defensive operations along the lengthy frontline in Ukraine requires the Russian military to expend a significant number of shells and rockets daily. The Ukrainian Joint Forces Task Force released an interview on December 24 with a Ukrainian servicemember in the Bakhmut area detailing that Russian forces have been conducting an extremely high pace of assaults on Ukrainian positions in the area with little corresponding progress. The Wagner Groups reported heavy losses in the Bakhmut area in recent weeks have also likely strained Russian forces current operational capabilities in the area. The Russian militarys personnel and munitions constraints will likely prevent it from maintaining the current high pace of offensive operations in the Bakhmut area in the near-term. Russian forces previously allocated significant resources in a meat-grinder effort to seize Severodonesk and Lysychansk in springsummer 2022. Russian forces culminated after capturing Lysychansk in early July and failed to capture neighboring Siversk to the east or Sloviansk to the northeast. The Russian militarys fixation with conducting a highly attritional campaign to achieve the tactical objectives of capturing Severdonetsk and Lysychansk ultimately undermined the Russian militarys ability to achieve its larger operational objective to envelop Ukrainian forces in a cauldron along the E40 highway and eventually drive to Donetsk Oblasts western administrative borders. Russias relentless and costly push on Bakhmut may also degrade Russias ability to pursue long-term objectives in the Donbas theater. Russian siloviki may be setting information conditions to justify the nationalization of oligarchs resources to sponsor Russias war effort. Wagner financier Yeveniy Prigozhin attended the funeral of a deceased Wagner Group mercenary in St. Petersburg on December 24, where he stated that Russia needs to confiscate luxury possessions and accommodations from elites who ignore or do not support the war effort out of fear of losing their privileged lifestyles. Prigozhin added that these affluent individuals support a vision where \"Western curators\" dominate Russia in return for the sponsorship of their lifestyles and compared todays Russian oligarchy to Ukraines or to 1990s Russia. Prigozhin ignited a scandal regarding the burial of the Wagner serviceman in recent weeks to push his political objectives such as the legalization of Wagner in Russia and his statements advocating redistribution of wealth at the funeral gained significant traction on the Russian internet. Wagner-affiliated milbloggers widely supported Prigozhins criticism of Russian officials and praised his support for the war effort. Prigozhin may be using such populist proposals to elevate his authority in Russian society or influence a return of stricter nationalization measures. Russian President Vladimir Putin also indirectly attacked Russian oligarchs on December 22, however, stating that Russians who drain Russias money from abroad and do not have a connection with the country \"represent a danger\" to Russia. Putin claimed that while the vast majority of Russian businessmen are patriots, there are some who do not share the sentiment. Putin concluded that \"everyone strives not only to stay, to live and work in Russia but to work for the benefit of our country.\" Putin previously nationalized big businesses in the early 2000s to consolidate his authoritarian kleptocracy and may be attempting leverage nationalization to coerce elites to support his war in Ukraine or seize their property to fund military expenses. Ukrainian intelligence continues to suggest that the Russian military is not following proper command structures or procedures. Chief of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Kyrylo Budanov stated that Prigozhin formed an alliance with the Commander of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, Army General Sergey Surovikin. Budanov noted that both Prigozhin and Surovikin are rivals of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, and that Prigozhin used the alliance to his advantage to receive heavy weapons from Russian Armed Forces for Wagner forces. The allocation of military resources should in principle rest with the Minister of Defense rather than the theater commander, although Surovikin could have the authority to make transfers once equipment enters the theater. The PrigozhinSurovikin alliance is plausible given that Prigozhin had previously praised Surovikin for his efforts to save the collapsing Soviet Union.

ISW introduced a new section in the update to track daily observed indicators and counter-indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus.\"\n\nPutin has already lost the war, like Hitler in 1943 European Commission vice president, Euromaidan Press reports. \"Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President of the European Commission, believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in the same position as Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in 1943 when he already lost the war, but it was far from over.\n\nRussia is now a total pariah internationally. The sanctions bite hard dare I say that. The war costs a lot of money. And Putin has already lost. He was mistaken about the resistance of the Ukrainians. Thats because no one dares tell him the whole truth anymore, including about the state of his army, which was cannibalized by corrupt officers.\n\nBut Hitler had already lost the war at the end of 1943, and it lasted another two years. Putin can cause a lot of mess for a very long time. Hence the bombing of the energy infrastructure, with the aim of plunging people into such misery that millions come to Europe. He uses energy and migration as a weapon against us, because he knows that we are vulnerable on those two points and can be played apart, in the hope that the political forces in which he has invested for years will gain more political power in the member states, he said, speaking to Nieuwsblad.\n\nMr. Timmermans also told what is needed to defeat Russia: as Putin invaded Ukraine after the EUs weak reaction to the occupation of Crimea the only way to go is to keep strong and support Ukraine:\n\nThe only thing that will lead to a change of course in Moscow is the realization that the West is not giving up no matter what it is doing on the ground. Once Putin and Lavrov start to think that there are cracks in the front, they can hold on even longer. We must keep ranks closed, form a front with the Americans and continue to support Ukraine financially and militarily. And if more refugees arrive, we have to receive them properly again. So far I dont see any cracks. Even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban now joins financial support for Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian forces used Russian soldiers panicked cell phone calls to pinpoint their locations and pick them off, report says, Insider reports. \"Russian soldiers in Ukraine made worried calls home as their efforts in Ukraine faltered but their loved ones werent the only ones listening. Ukrainian forces used the cell phone calls made by Russian soldiers to locate them and wipe the troops out in large numbers, according to an investigation published by The New York Times that details Russias blunders throughout the war.\n\nWe listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives, a Ukrainian official who leads the efforts to intercept the phone calls told The Times. They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.\n\nUkrainian authorities who monitor cell networks for criminal activity noticed that a large number of calls were being placed from foreign phone numbers in an area along the Ukraine and Belarus border. The officials deduced the unusual uptick in foreign numbers on the Ukrainian network were likely Russian soldiers.\n\nUkraine deployed teams of women to follow the soldiers calls and alert the Ukrainian military, which would carry out attacks using the information. We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using, the Ukrainian official told The Times. At one point, Ukrainian forces used both the cell phone calls and a TikTok video to locate a unit of Chechen soldiers outside of Kyiv. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraines military intelligence, told The Times the units location was confirmed only 40 minutes after the video was uploaded. Ukrainian forces then struck them with three missiles.\n\nUkrainian officials have frequently intercepted phone calls made by Russian soldiers since the invasion 10 months ago. Audio of the calls obtained by various outlets have captured Russian soldiers complaining about being unprepared and unorganized and hoping they would get injured so they could be sent home. In new audio published by The Times, soldiers could be heard complaining about Russian President Vladimir Putin and saying they are being treated like cannon fodder.\"\n\nPutin may use Iranian missiles and drones to destroy Patriot system media, Ukrinform reports, citing Forbes. \"Putin may ultimately use Iranian-supplied weaponry and Iranian tactics in any attempt he makes to eliminate Ukraines Patriot. Specifically, he might try and replicate a combat-tested strategy used by the Houthis against the Saudi-led coalition during the Yemen war, the article says.\n\nIt adds that that strategy saw the Houthis use their Qasef-1 loitering munitions, a variant of the Iranian Ababil-2, against the coalitions Patriots. The munitions were programmed with open-source GPS coordinates of the Patriot positions, which they used to target their radars. Once they neutralized those radars, the Houthis would fire SRBMs, many of them also based on Iranian designs, without worrying about the Patriots successfully intercepting them.\n\nIf the Ukrainian Patriot is fixed in place in Kyiv, which is very likely, Russia may launch an unprecedented number of Shaheds in swarm attacks directed against its radar and bombard the area with SRBMs to ensure the destruction of that battery. By doing so, Moscow would signal that its attacks are unstoppable despite the efforts of the US and its allies to build up and enhance Ukraines air defenses, Forbes said.\n\nAt the same time, the media outlet draws attention to the fact that Washington has never suggested that supplying the Patriot will constitute a so-called game-changer in this war. The delivery is much more symbolic of continued American resolve to support Ukraine. However, its destruction could likewise prove symbolic for Putin, who may conclude that launching a major operation to destroy it would be a worthy endeavor purely for the propaganda value, the article reads.\"\n\nConsequences and what to do?\n\nTrying to find ways to improve outcomes and reduce Ukraines dependence on high rates of artillery fire, by Michael Kofman, Director, Russia Studies at CNA. \"The US is trying to find ways to improve outcomes and reduce Ukraines dependence on high rates of arty fire. Less attrition, more manoeuvre.\n\nTraining to do combined arms at company/battalion level is good in and of itself, but it wont necessarily solve this problem. I have no doubt Ukraine can learn combined arms manoeuvre and saw elements of this at Kharkiv. However, without the US Air Force air superiority, US logistics, C4ISR, etc its a bit hard to fight like Americans. How well would we do without airpower?\n\nMore importantly, it misses the fact that attrition is what enabled manoeuvre in Ukraine offensives. Against a well-prepared defence, with sufficient density of forces, it wasnt nearly as successful, and casualties were high. This is why Kherson was so difficult compared to Kharkiv/Lyman. Ukraine way of war depends on fires, exploited by manoeuvre. It is a successor military to the Soviet military, which was artillery centric, and in that respect is much closer to the Russian military than our own.\n\nYou have to work with what has proven successful for your partners. Deep strike, precision, better ISR, can help improve Ukraine performance. My bias is that Im wary of seeing a solution that implies trying to turn that military more into us. That said, theres no easy answer here. The US is not optimized to support a protracted artillery-driven war in Europe. Folks can also judge for themselves, looking at the history how good we are at converting other militaries to fighting more like Americans.\n\nHans Petter Midttuns assessment\n\nIn recent months, several articles have painted a picture of President Putin as ill-advised, increasingly paranoid, and surrounded by pro-war hawks.\n\nThe Times article \"Inside Putins bunker: how he kept the plan to invade Ukraine secret\" argued that President Putting \"remained in lockdown\" after Moscow officially emerged from lockdown on June 9, 2020. He would continue to be extremely cautious to the point of paranoia about the virus two years later. As a result, Putins personal contact which for years had been limited to a small group of no more than three dozen insiders, shrunk even further.\n\nIn the seclusion and inaccessibility of his Covid bunker, surrounded by ideologues and sycophants, Putin developed a deep belief that Russian domination over Ukraine must be restored, according to former Kommersant newspaper political editor Mikhail Zygar.\n\nOr as the CIAs Burns would put it in April 2022, Putins risk appetite has grown as his grip on Russia has tightened. His circle of advisers has narrowed and in that small circle, it has never been career-enhancing to question his judgment or his almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russias sphere of influence.\n\nOver two years in isolation, Putin developed a longstanding enthusiasm for historical theorising, which would culminate in an essay on Russia and Ukraine published in July 2021. The essay, according to one senior state TV executive, was entirely [Putins] own work the result of much research and deep thought\".\n\nNot only had the group of insiders shrunk but the \"most deluded and the most ideologically driven members of Putins entourage were on the inside, while those with the most detailed real-world knowledge were on the outside.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article \"Putin, Isolated and Distrustful, Leans on Handful of Hard-Line Advisers\" portrayed Putin in a similar manner. US officials have described his closest allies as even more hard-line than the authoritarian leader himself. He found himself \"isolated and distrustful at the pinnacle of a power structure designed to reinforce his belligerent worldview and shelter him from discouraging news\".\n\nPutins \"circle of advisers narrowed and in that small circle, it has never been career-enhancing to question his judgment or his almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russias influence.\n\nIt is claimed that Putin became increasingly paranoid as the circle tightened.\n\n\"The president increasingly speaks of Russia in near-religious terms, as a 1,000-year-old civilization waging a holy struggle that will right historical wrongs and elevate him into a pantheon of conquering czarist leaders such as Peter the Great.\"\n\nHis situational awareness has been questioned since the very start of the full-scale invasion. According to the WSJ article, Putin has long refused to use the internet for fear of digital surveillance, making him extremely reliant on briefing documents compiled by ideologically aligned advisers. Battlefield updates can take several days to reach him, leaving them often out of date. While he has attempted to improve his access to information, including reaching out to the pro-war milbloggers, he \"remains surrounded by an administration that caters to his conviction that Russia will succeed, despite the mounting human and economic sacrifices.\"\n\nAttempts to present him with a more balanced assessment of the real situation are allegedly stopped by his staff.\n\nThe two articles paint a highly worrisome picture of a president without a flawed grasp of reality, a distorted perception of Russian history and historical rights, surrounded and advised by a small group of ideologically driven pro-war hawks. He is sometimes described as paranoid, a quality that probably comes with the job description of most autocracies.\n\nI find the description of the flawed command structure, the limited flow of information, the lack of trust, balanced information, critical thinking, and situational awareness, extremely important. That is without a doubt, a critical Russian vulnerability that will help speed up its demise.\n\nThe concerns about President Putins state of mind, however, do not come across as convincing.\n\nAcknowledging that psychology is a highly dynamic field and that a personality might change over time, the articles had one common weakness: Their starting point is (more or less) aligned with the start of the full-scale war.\n\nThey leave out the events leading up to the war in 2014, including President Putins strategic narratives. His messaging has remained near constant since 2007. His Ukraine obsession has been a part of his strategic thinking since his infamous Munich Security Conference speech.\n\nThe Russian full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022 was by no means a starting point but a \"logical\" consequence of 15 years of violations of international law and an increasingly more aggressive Russian Foreign Policy.\n\nIts violations of international law until 24 February include its attack on Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, war crimes in Syria, attempted coup in Montenegro, the downing of MH-17, closure of the Kerch Strait, blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov and the attack on its navy, restrictions on international freedom of navigation, terrorist attacks and not least, its hybrid war against both Ukraine as well as the NATO and EU member states. The latter includes repeated interference in elections and referendums, energy war, information war, cyber-attacks, liquidations, political manipulation, and more.\n\nThe invasion was not a result of a rash decision, but a carefully, calculated process resulting from years of actively undermining Ukraine and testing Western resolve. The Russian misinterpretation of the West is first of all an indication of failed NATO and EU diplomacy and their failure to respond resolutely to 15 years of Russian provocations. The ultimatum served to the USA and NATO on 17 December, while being utterly unrealistic, served as a climax of years of Russian diplomacy, demands and threats.\n\nIts failure to read Ukraine correctly, however, is probably more complex. Its a reflection of Russias perception of Ukraine as a \"little brother\", otherwise described as arrogance. It is probably also a consequence of both its own disinformation and wishful thinking, resulting from the notion of \"historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians\". Putins essay on the subject from July 2021 only summarised views he had conveyed for years already.\n\n\"I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia. Our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries and have their origins in the same sources, they have been hardened by common trials, achievements and victories. Our kinship has been transmitted from generation to generation. It is in the hearts and the memory of people living in modern Russia and Ukraine, in the blood ties that unite millions of our families. Together we have always been and will be many times stronger and more successful. For we are one people.\"\n\nUnderestimating Ukrainian resolve and resistance was also a result of the previously described failings: a flawed Russian command structure, staff reinforcing Putins own thinking, a limited flow of information, a lack of trust, balanced information, critical thinking, and situational awareness. But there is probably also a darker and more ominous element to it. What happened in Kherson the oblast that on paper should have been the easiest to defend but where the gate was left open might have also served as a clue to their expectations as to what would happen in other sectors.\n\nReviewing the last 15 years the invasion is nothing, but a continuation of a policy set in motion years ago. Even the inner circle consists of people who have been a part of the continuity.\n\nWhen it happened, it was not a sign of an unstable or unhinged president. It was the sign of a predetermined, strategic leader who had patiently built the military capability needed, undermined his victim and tested his opponent and still got it wrong for failing to build a leadership culture allowing for critical thinking, falling victim to his own distorted information and history and not least, failing to understand the extent systematic corruption and theft had destroyed Russia from within.\n\nAggressive? Frustrated? Disappointed? Very much so. Sane? Most likely. Stupid? Not at all. Fcked? Big time.",

But it is trying to compensate for its losses with the gloating of its propagandists after the missile strikes at our country, at our energy sector,\" he said.\n\n3:05 p.m.: Support from partners to Ukraines energy sector amounts to $1.5 billion, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on December 25.\n\nHe added that 200 trucks with equipment to repair damaged infrastructure have already arrived in Ukraine.\n\nShmyhal added that Ukraine has managed to mobilize over $30 billion in support from its allies and that G-7 countries will mobilize up to $32 billion in financial assistance next year.\n\nRussia has caused $6.8 billion in damage to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, The Kyiv Independent reports.\n\nOver the past two months, due to constant attacks, the Russian military has either damaged or destroyed about 40% of the Ukrainian energy system.\n\nIn a Christmas tweet, the Ukrainian prime minister said \"The war separated many of us. May Christmas bring comfort and spiritual balance to every Ukrainian, wherever you are.\"\n\n2:05 p.m.: Utility-related disasters in Russian towns raise suspicions of sabotage linked to the war in Ukraine. But poorly maintained infrastructure is a long-standing and persistent problem in Russia the result of old Soviet-era systems in need of repair and costly maintenance, decades of endemic corruption, and the governments prioritization of defense and security budgets, as well as the development of major cities over regional towns, The Washington Post reported.\n\nA huge gas pipeline explosion outside St. Petersburg last month, major fires in two separate Moscow shopping malls allegedly caused by dodgy welding, and faulty power grids that have left tens of thousands without heat and electricity are just some of the incidents reported since Russias efforts to obliterate Ukraines infrastructure that began in October.\n\nIn late October, two sewer pipes burst in the southern city of Volgograd, flooding several streets with feces and wastewater, and leaving 200,000 of the 1 million residents without water or heating for several days.\n\nIlya Kravchenko, a local lawmaker who collected testimony from more than 1,000 victims of the incident and filed a lawsuit against the corporation that owns the sewer system, said the sight was \"not pretty.\"\n\n\"This is the worst year on record. The city has never had so many problems,\" Kravchenko said.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to \"bring back freedom\" to the people of Ukraine as he addressed the nation on Christmas Eve, just hours after a fresh round of Russian attacks killed at least 10 people and wounded more than 60 others, RFE/RL reported.\n\n12 p.m.: In his traditional Christmas address from St. Peters Basilica at the Vatican on Sunday December 25, Pope Francis appealed to end Russias all-out war in Ukraine, calling the war \"senseless.\" AFP reported.\n\n\"May the Lord inspire us to offer concrete gestures of solidarity to assist all those who are suffering, and may he enlighten the minds of those who have the power to silence the thunder of weapons and put an immediate end to this senseless war,\" he said.\n\nThe 86-year-old Pope also said that the war is creating more food shortages around the world, urging an end to the use of \"food as a weapon.\"\n\n11:15 a.m.: Russian troops fired three missiles at an industrial zone in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Dec. 25, but there are no casualties so far, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko said on Facebook.\n\nHoncharenko urged residents to stay in shelters, saying that \"the danger has not gone away,\" The Kyiv Independent reports.\n\n10:45 a.m.: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has defended what he says is his countrys position of impartiality on the war in Ukraine and indicated that China would strengthen ties with Russia in the coming year. Speaking by video to a conference in the Chinese capital Sunday, Wang also blamed America for the deterioration in relations between the worlds two largest economies, saying that China has \"firmly rejected the United States erroneous China policy.\"\n\nChina's refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine and join others in imposing sanctions on Russia has further frayed ties and fueled an emerging divide with much of Europe. Wang said that China would \"deepen strategic mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation\" with Russia. Warships from the two countries held joint naval drills in the East China Sea last week, AP reported.\n\n10 a.m.: Many Christian Orthodox Ukrainians celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7, as do the Russians. But this year, after to the Russian invasion on the country, many Orthodox Ukrainians have decided to observe Christmas on Dec. 25, like other Christian denominations around the world.\n\nThe idea of commemorating the birth of Jesus in December was considered radical in Ukraine until Russia attacked Ukraine.\n\nIn October, the leadership of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is not aligned with the Russian church and one of two branches of Orthodox Christianity in the country, agreed to allow faithful to celebrate on Dec. 25, AP reported.\n\nFor some Ukrainians, changing dates represents a separation from Russia, its culture, and religion.\n\n9:30 a.m.: Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Duma, said the Russian lower house of parliament was preparing a law to introduce higher taxation for people who have left the country since the war in Ukraine began in February.\n\n\"It is right to cancel preferences for those who have left the Russian Federation and to introduce an increased tax rate for them,\" Volodin wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\"We are working on appropriate changes to the legislation.\"\n\nIt is not clear how many Russians have left the country since February 2022, Reuters reported.\n\nBy early October, some local media had reported that as many as 700,000 had fled following the September announcement of a mobilization drive to call up as many as 300,000 to fight. The government rejected that figure at the time.\n\nRussia's 13% personal income tax is deducted automatically by domestic employers. Russians working abroad who are Russian tax residents must pay the tax independently, according to the Federal Tax Service of Russia.\n\n\"Those who realized that they had made a mistake have already returned,\" Volodin said. \"The rest should understand: the vast majority of society does not support their act and believes that they betrayed their country, relatives and friends.\"\n\n9 a.m.: Three Ukrainian emergency services workers were killed on Saturday when a landmine exploded while they were demining parts of the Kherson region, said the emergency service of another region, in which they served, Reuters reported.\n\n\"All three selflessly served in the emergency and rescue squad of the Special Purpose Unit of the State Department of Ukraine in Zhytomyr region and performed the task of demining territories liberated from the enemy in the Kherson region,\" the Zhytomyr emergency service said on its Facebook page.\n\nThe Zhytomyr region is west of Kyiv, in northern Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. State Department estimated in early December that some 160,000 square kilometers (62,000 square miles) of Ukrainian land needed to be checked for explosives hazards. That is nearly half the size of Germany's land area.\n\n\"We expect this to be one of the largest landmine and unexploded ordinance challenges since World War Two,\" the State Department said in a briefing posted on its website.\n\n8 a.m.: Russia is ready to negotiate with all parties involved in the war in Ukraine but Kyiv and its Western backers have refused to engage in talks, President Vladimir Putin said in an interview aired on Sunday.\n\n\"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them - we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are,\" Putin told Rossiya 1 state television in the interview.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on twitter that Putin needed to return to reality and acknowledge that it was Russia which did not want any negotiations.\n\nThe Kremlin says it will fight until all its aims are achieved while Kyiv says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from all of its territory, including Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n7:45 a.m.: Air raid sirens blared in Kyiv and across all Ukrainian regions on Sunday morning, but no new Russian attacks were reported, officials said. The all-clear was later given.\n\nUnconfirmed Ukrainian social media reports suggested the sirens may have been triggered after Russian jets took to the skies in Belarus and that the all-clear was sounded after the planes returned to their bases.\n\nReuters was unable to verify those reports.\n\nYuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's air forces, told national television earlier on Sunday that Russian military jets were flying virtually around the clock. Ihnat said Ukrainian authorities have increased readiness.\n\n\"Everything that takes off must be under our control,\" he said.\n\n5:18 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Ukrainian intelligence continues to suggest that the Russian military is not following proper command structures or procedures.\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Kreminna-Svatove line, the assessment said, and also continued to conduct offensive operations around Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\n\n4:14 a.m.:\n\n2:19 a.m.: Three emergency workers from Zhytomyr Oblast were killed while demining in Kherson Oblast on Saturday, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a Facebook post, The Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nThe workers had gone to Kherson Oblast to assist with the demining process after parts of the oblast were liberated by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThey were killed by Russian mines that exploded during the demining process, according to the post.\n\nSerhii Kruk, who heads Ukraine's State Emergency Service, said about 30% of Ukrainian territory is mined.\n\nOn Nov. 14, Kherson Oblast Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said that Russian troops had mined \"nearly everything\" in the recently liberated Kherson and asked people to avoid gathering in the central part of the city as sappers needed to demine it first.\n\nUkrainian forces liberated parts of Ukraine's southern Kherson Oblast, including the regional capital Kherson, on Nov. 11.\n\n1:10 a.m.: Starting Jan. 1, Ukrainians will be able to exchange up to 5 incandescent lightbulbs for the LED variety, Euromaidan Press reported.\n\nThe program envisions swapping 50 million bulbs through Ukraines state postal operator Ukrposhta and digital platform Diia.\n\nAccording to Economy Minister Yulia Svyridenko, replacing 50 million such bulbs can save Ukraine up to 1.5 gigawatts of electricity during peak hours.\n\nThe purchase of 30 million such bulbs will be financed by the European Commission.\n\nThis measure is being undertaken in response to a deficit in Ukraines power grid caused by Russian missile strikes on electricity infrastructure which are estimated to affect roughly 50% of all energy facilities.\n\n12:02 a.m.:\n\nSome information came from Agence France-Presse, The Associated Press and Reuters.",

                "cc_text": "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the largest on European soil since World War II, will not cease over Christmas. The Ukrainian government has ruled out a Christmas break until Russia withdraws its troops from its territory. \"There will be a complete ceasefire on our part only when not a single occupier remains on our territory,\" Alexei Gromov, deputy chief of the main operational command of the Ukrainian army's General Staff, told a press conference. Meanwhile Russia warns that if the US continues to support Zelensky, there will be \"harsh consequences\".\n\nAfter Ukrainian troops carried out their biggest offensive on Kremlin-controlled Ukrainian soil on Thursday, Russian forces continued shelling and air strikes along the entire eastern frontline, killing one person. Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-backed mayor of the city of Donetsk, said 40 rockets were fired from BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers at civilians in the city centre in the early hours. To which Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov, at a press conference, refuted that the Kremlin seeks to turn the conflict into a protracted armed confrontation.\n\nKulemzin appreciated the Donetsk attack as a war crime and exposed that it was the largest in the city since 2014, when pro-Moscow separatists seized control from Kiev. Preliminary estimates showed five people were wounded, including a child, it said. Ukraine's military staff said Moscow's focus remained on the eastern towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, and that Ukrainian forces had repelled Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. He stressed that the Russian attacks also affected civilian infrastructure in the southern areas of Zaporiyia and Kherson.\n\nThe president said this week that Russia should begin withdrawing at Christmas as a step towards ending the conflict, but Moscow rejected the proposal and said Ukraine must first accept the loss of territory. \"There is no calm on the front line,\" Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky said in a video address on Wednesday, and indicated that Russian artillery attacks on eastern cities had left \"only bare ruins and craters\". \"The Russians fired in different areas along the entire front line,\" said the Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nAmid rumours of a possible supply to Kiev of Patriot air defence systems, Russia warned Washington on Thursday that this would increase the risk of direct US involvement in the armed conflict. \"Many experts, including abroad, have questioned the wisdom of such a step, which leads to an escalation of the conflict, increases the risk of direct involvement of the US military in hostilities,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a press conference. According to the spokeswoman, \"Washington continues to twist the arms of other NATO countries, demanding from them a more substantial contribution to the militarisation of Ukraine\".\n\n\"We would like to remind them that all weapons supplied by the West to Ukraine are legitimate military targets for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and will be destroyed or captured, as our country has repeatedly said,\" Zakharova stressed, repeating the words of her Kremlin counterpart Dmitry Peskov. US President Joe Biden this week ruled out the possibility of his country deploying troops to Ukraine, although he has already proposed financial assistance to Kiev. Meanwhile, the city centre of Kherson was shelled for a second day, according to the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.\n\nWith the war continuing unabated, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Trk presented a report documenting the killings of at least 441 civilians in Ukraine, which he said could constitute war crimes. \"There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report could constitute deliberate killings, a war crime,\" Trk stressed as he presented it to a special session of the Human Rights Council. The study, prepared after three field visits, focuses on violations committed in the Kiev, Chernikov and Sumi regions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine, attacks by both sides continue unabated. Millions of people wake up every day to shelling, not knowing whether they will be able to celebrate Christmas with their families. While children dream, the broken hearts of so many parents weep at not being able to fulfil the wishes of the youngest and most vulnerable in the house. That is why children this year are asking for simple things like electricity, water and heating as gifts for the holidays. No toys or electronic devices. Even the classic batteries are in short supply.",

                "cc_text": "Scroll left and right to explore the image\n\nThe Year in Pictures 2022\n\nBy Joseph Kahn, executive editor\n\nThe images from the earliest moments of the Ukraine conflict revealed sheer terror and disbelief. War had reached a major European capital, Kyiv, and its immediate outskirts. Refugees shoved their way onto a train headed west, pushing past a woman who shut her eyes and screamed.\n\nA woman and her two children lay dead on a roadside, felled by a blast that narrowly missed our photographer, Lynsey Addario. The first photo we published of a dead Russian soldier in Kharkiv, a day after the conflict began, shows the corpse covered by a fresh dusting of snow.\n\nEvery year, starting in early fall, photo editors at The New York Times begin sifting through the years work in an effort to pick out the most startling, most moving, most memorable pictures. Recently, every year seems like a history-making year: a pandemic that killed millions; an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; and, in 2022, a war with frightening echoes of the 20th centurys devastating world wars.\n\nAlthough the war in Ukraine wasnt this years only story, it was the most dominant photographers for The Times filed some 16,000 images, often in circumstances that endangered their lives.\n\nAfter the shock of the invasion, the photos began to change. Lynsey, Tyler Hicks and David Guttenfelder, fellow veterans of conflict coverage, told us that the destruction of an artillery war produces too many similar scenes. They began seeking something different.\n\nAs the war ground on, they captured a new mood in facial expressions: resignation, but also resilience. A Ukrainian soldier, on leave from the front, lightly held his girlfriend as he placed a soft kiss on her forehead. In the village of Demydiv, someone carrying a bag waded alone down a street that had become a river, flooded by Ukrainians themselves to thwart the Russian advance.\n\nBy April, it had become a war of attrition. Even big battles and major advances proved indecisive, with both sides digging in for an extended conflict.\n\nLooking at these images from 2022, its impossible not to see fragments of a different kind of war, one being waged here in the United States, with mass shootings taking lives seemingly every week. Sometimes, the most powerful image is of an object that reveals that pain and tragedy, like Tamir Kalifas photograph of a bullet-riddled notebook retrieved from a classroom in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two teachers were killed. The notebook belonged to one of those children Uziyah Garcia, a 10-year-old.\n\nThere was also change on the social and political fronts. Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, a moment caught in a magical photograph of Leila Jackson gazing at her mother in loving admiration. It was taken by Sarahbeth Maney, who is also a young woman of color.\n\nA gorgeous and powerful black-and-white photo of a pregnant woman in Ohio who had made the difficult decision to have a reduction the termination of one severely unhealthy fetus to save the life of its healthy sibling spoke to the anguish.\n\nHers was one of the last such procedures legal under Ohios changing law.\n\nBut 2022 undoubtedly belongs to the war in Ukraine, a conflict now settling into a worryingly predictable rhythm. Finbarr OReillys image of an explosion on Kyivs skyline, as Russia retaliated against Ukrainian advances with missile attacks on civilian targets, shows the war as raw and low-tech, because it is. Dumb bombs and artillery blow up buildings for the sole purpose of scaring people.\n\nAnd yet moments of optimism and joy do arrive. A photo by Laetitia Vancon delights us with the sight of elegantly dressed teenagers dancing on a street in Odesa. We see what they have lost because of Vladimir Putins aggression against their country but also what they refuse to lose.\n\nWith this collection, we recognize our photographers for their outstanding work around the world, and hope you will understand more about their thinking and their day-to-day processes as they explain, in their own words, how they got the story.\n\nJanuary Katerynivka, Ukraine, Jan. 19.

Elliot Ross for The New York Times Elliot Ross joined Wendy Marcum as she did her grocery shopping for the coming weeks. \"As we were walking the final blocks to her temporary home, this sodden, shivering pregnant dog appeared and went up to Wendy under the glow of a streetlight. Instinctively, she dropped the groceries to the pavement and took this sad, smelly creature into her arms and into the house. I was struck by the parallels between Wendy and the dog two creatures in need of home and heart.\" Louisville, Colo., Jan. 2. More than 1,000 homes were destroyed when the devastating Marshall fire, fueled by hurricane-force winds, swept through suburban neighborhoods between Denver and Boulder. Erin Schaff/The New York Times \"When youre standing on the ground, you cant visualize the scope of the destruction.

The Ukrainian capital was transformed into a war zone as Russias invasion was met with fierce resistance. Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Lynsey Addario arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. 14, shortly before the invasion began. \"We went to the site where the building had been attacked that morning. There was a woman who basically just kind of came out to start surveying her house. You need some human interaction when you make these photographs. You have to show the scale, the effect and whats left behind in peoples lives. Thats the challenge with covering war. This war is an artillery war. We see the same images over and over, and its really hard to make anything different.\" Kyiv, Ukraine, Feb 26. Julia, center, a teacher and volunteer, waiting to be deployed in the war.

I decided to get out of the car and walk to make sure we werent going to drive up to any surprises. There was snow on the ground and I wasnt sure what I was going to find, but I eventually came upon several Russian soldiers who had been killed.

                "cc_text": "When Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he was expecting a quick and decisive victory that would cement his place in Russian history and reverse the verdict of 1991 by extinguishing Ukrainian independence once and for all. Instead, the year draws to a close with his army demoralized by successive defeats and Russias reputation as a military superpower in tatters.\n\nIn the first days of the invasion, it soon became clear that things were not going according to plan. Far from greeting Russian troops as liberators, the Ukrainian nation rose up in defiance. Kremlin intelligence forecasts predicting the rapid collapse of the Ukrainian military also proved wildly inaccurate. On the contrary, Ukrainian forces fought back with unexpected skill and ferocity, leading to catastrophic Russian losses.\n\nBy the end of March, Russia had conceded defeat in the Battle of Kyiv and withdrawn entirely from northern Ukraine. Putin responded to this setback by regrouping his decimated forces in eastern Ukraine and concentrating on completing the occupation of the Donbas region. Despite initial success due to Russias overwhelming artillery advantage, this offensive had largely stalled by midsummer with the initiative passing to Ukraine.\n\nThe second half of 2022 was marked by a series of spectacular Ukrainian victories. Russian troops were routed in the Kharkiv region and forced to retreat from the strategically important southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian regional capital to be occupied by Russia. The withdrawal from Kherson was a personal humiliation for Putin. Just weeks earlier, he had hosted a lavish annexation ceremony in the Kremlin and proclaimed that Kherson had joined Russia \"forever.\"\n\nUnable to make progress on the battlefield, Putin changed tack in October and ordered the methodical destruction of Ukraines civilian infrastructure. Waves of airstrikes featuring missiles and kamikaze drones have since plunged Ukraine into darkness while depriving millions of Ukrainians of heating, water, and electricity. This bombing campaign is causing great hardship but does not appear to be undermining Ukraines fighting spirit.\n\nWhile the Russian dictators dreams of an historic victory have failed to materialize, he is not yet ready to admit defeat. In September, Putin announced his countrys first mobilization since World War II, allowing him add a further 300,000 men to his depleted invasion force. Additional waves of mobilization are possible in the coming months. On the home front, the Russian economy is being prepared for the rigors of a long war. Nor is there any sign of significant domestic unrest. Polls indicate that most Russians continue to support the invasion, while those who do not have largely remained silent or chosen exile over protest.\n\nThere is currently no end in sight to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin officials insist Moscow will achieve its objectives, while Western leaders are equally adamant that Russia must not be allowed to succeed. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Ukrainians see the war as a fight for national survival against an openly genocidal enemy. This leaves little room for negotiations or a compromise peace.\n\nWith fighting set to continue into 2023, the Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their observations of the war so far. Why has Putins Ukraine invasion gone so disastrously wrong?\n\nDaniel Fried, Weiser Family Distinguished Fellow, Atlantic Council: What went wrong? Lots of little things but two big things in particular: Russias failure to understand Ukraine and its failure to understand its own system. The Kremlin seems to have believed its own propaganda that the Ukrainian nation does not exist except in subordination to Russia. In this view, a Ukrainian nation that insists it has separate identity and national existence is merely a fascist deformity that must be destroyed by fire and sword. Those familiar with Russian and Soviet imperial thinking can discern the antecedents: Nineteenth century Russian reactionary nationalism and its Soviet counterpart that attempted to identify any Ukrainian patriotism exclusively with its right-wing expression during WWII.\n\nThe Kremlin seems not to grasp how deep Ukrainian patriotism runs and how it has taken shape in a more liberal, multi-ethnic, and pro-democratic form, partly in revulsion against Putinism and its malign values. This spirit of patriotism, personified but not created by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has so far enabled the Ukrainian military to maintain its morale and helped Ukrainian society stand firm in the face of terror and deprivation.\n\nIn contrast, Putins corrupt system fueled by theft and deceit has hollowed out the Russian military and left Russian society generally cynical. Russian state television features bloodthirsty commentators while thousands of Russian young men flee the country to avoid military service. The sacrifices Ukrainians are willing to make as they fight for their lives and their country seem foreign to Putins Russia. Like the Czarist regime in the early twentieth century, Putin seems to have believed a \"short victorious war\" was just the tonic his system needed. But Russias failure in the 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War merely exposed the rot at the heart of the empire.\n\nTyrannies often turn out to be weaker than the image put forth by their strutting leaders. Democracies often turn out to be resilient in ways that can astonish those who look no further than their messy politics or peacetime pettiness. So it seems with Russia and Ukraine, with the battle still in the balance.\n\nSuriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: With Russian atrocities continuing, it is still far too soon to declare that Putin has failed in his effort to make Ukraine sorry for not wanting to be Russian. At the same time, its certainly clear that he is not winning. This failure to win is rooted in Putins own lack of understanding that Ukrainians are not Russians. Obviously, this is most immediately evident in Ukraines willingness to fight in order to avoid being forcibly subsumed into Russia.\n\nOn a deeper level, Ukrainians have demonstrated emphatically that they differ from their Russian neighbors in terms of the national character they have displayed during the past ten months of war. The innovation, work ethic, and commitment to country over self shown by Ukrainians are all qualities that, if they previously existed in Russia, Putin himself has worked hard to erode.\n\nSince February, Putin has found Ukraine a very a different opponent compared to the country he expected to face. Ukraines aptitude for teamwork and ability to rapidly change tactics are factors that he simply has no answer for. And it is these same Ukrainian qualities that will ensure the country eventually rebuilds and rebounds.\n\nSteve Pifer, William J. Perry Fellow, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University: Several reasons help explain why Russias invasion of Ukraine has gone so badly. First, the Kremlin and Russian General Staff greatly underestimated their foe and did not expect the Ukrainians to resist with such tenacity, skill, and courage. It is astonishing that they so badly misunderstood their neighbor. It was clear to Western observers that Ukrainians would fiercely resist, as they see this as an existential fight.\n\nSecond, the Russian military has not mastered certain complex tactics such as combined arms operations and suppression of enemy air defenses. For example, armored columns entered urban areas unsupported by dismounted infantry, while Russian air power stays largely over Russian-controlled territory for fear of being shot down by Ukrainian air defense. This adds to other problems endemic in Russias military such as poor leadership, poor morale, and poor logistics.\n\nThird, the Kremlin has discovered that the defense sector is not immune from the corruption that pervades Russian society. Moscow is not getting the results it expected from the hundreds of billions of US dollars spent on modernizing the Russian military over the past 15 years. For example, the Russian military received precision-guided weapons that often miss targets or otherwise fail, while some tanks have explosive reactive armor plates filled with rubber rather than explosives.\n\nFourth, Though not moving as rapidly as they could and should, Western arms deliveries have given the Ukrainian army additional military tools to sustain its fight.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nKristina Hook, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University: Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine will be studied as one of the eras biggest political, military, economic, and moral failures. Years of corruption and bad governance weakened Russias military and institutional capabilities. The personal nature of Putins authoritarianism encouraged pilfering over policy planning and selective law enforcement over meritocracy, while creating neo-imperial blind spots that prevented key members of the Putin regime from understanding the historic nature of the changes taking place in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nMany Russians simply underestimated the talent and tenacity of Ukrainians, who used the last eight years of armed conflict in the east of the country to carry out crucial military reforms and develop civil society. Ugly stereotypes about Ukraine continue to undermine Russias ability to accept and learn from their military defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army.\n\nWhile credit for stalling Russias war machine belongs primarily to Ukraines defenders, citizens, and state, Putin also badly underestimated the Wests commitment to a rules-based global order. Despite Russian nuclear saber-rattling and erroneous assumptions of the democratic worlds readiness to abandon Ukraine, West military aid has continued to expand and diversify.\n\nLooking ahead, the genocidal nature of Russias war implies that we must prepare for Putin to double down on his failures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recently painted a sobering but realistic view of the military support still needed in order to protect civilians and prevent Russia from achieving its goals. Now is the time to continue demonstrating how ill-advised Putins miscalculations are.\n\nJames Sherr, Senior Fellow, International Centre for Defence and Security, Tallinn: In Russia, the absolute imperative of absolute victory is never deflected by anything so trivial as error. Between February and May, those who believed that the Russian military system had insulated itself from the venality, mendacity, and servility of the Putin system found themselves pleasantly or rudely surprised. But we see once again that just as Putin is on the point of losing one game, he starts another. The withdrawal of strike groupings from Kyiv was the prelude to the Donbas offensive, then to mobilization and reinforcement, and now to the crippling of Ukraines energy infrastructure, which has become indistinguishable from the wholesale destruction of the country. The latter enterprises are abetted by the appointment of the mercilessly competent Russian General Sergei Surovikin and Irans de facto entry into the war.\n\nIt is time we understood that as long as Putin remains in power, the war will continue. If, as is now possible, Russia forces a halt to Ukraines offensive momentum, this need not be long in duration nor disadvantageous to Ukraine. Russias military commanders are capable of learning lessons and are learning them; but the military system has limited capacity to absorb these lessons. In contrast, Ukraines capacity for adaptation, innovation, and renewal are unmatched and indestructible. Ukraines Western partners must draw a lesson of their own. Time favors Ukraine. But it must be used to deny Russia the sanctuaries it requires to shape the parameters and rules of this conflict.\n\nDiane Francis, Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: Putins invasion has failed so far because of several miscalculations. Crucially, he believed his own propaganda about Russias unassailable military might. He was also convinced that Ukraine was not a nation but a mere province of Russia. He believed NATO would remain ineffective. And he never dreamed that US President Joe Biden would help unite Europe and launch massive sanctions along with an unprecedented program to arm and support Ukraines defense.\n\nPutins first military mistake was to launch an unprovoked invasion with just 150,000 troops compared to the 600,000 soldiers sent in 1968 to crush anti-Soviet protests in Czechoslovakia, a country one-fifth the size of Ukraine. He also misunderstood the cultural shift in Ukraine toward the West and underestimated the leadership and communication skills of Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has harnessed the intelligence, resilience, patriotism, and unity of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nTen months into Russias invasion, Ukraine has gained the initiative thanks to a combination of battlefield courage and strategic skill along with massive Western help and favorable world opinion. Putin cannot reverse this. He has threatened a possible escalation to nuclear weapons but would do so at the peril of his nation. As he murders more civilians, bombs more infrastructure, and plunges Ukrainians into freezing darkness this winter, Putin is a reviled figure and is increasingly seen as a failure. Meanwhile, Ukraine is honored and celebrated across the globe.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, Ukrainian MP, Holos Party: The main reason Putin is failing is because he was too late. If he had struck in 2014 when the Ukrainian state was weak, the army was almost non-existent, institutions were unstable, and the opposition had much less influence on national affairs, his chances for success would have been much higher. However, Russia did not seize this opportunity and Ukraine was able to strengthen. The countrys strategic course toward the EU and NATO was enshrined in the Ukrainian Constitution, while the Ukrainian army underwent vital reforms that resulted in significantly increased quality.\n\nThe second reason behind Putins difficulties is the fact that the Russians did not expect to encounter broad civilian resistance in Ukraine. This reflects deeply entrenched Russian misconceptions about the nature of Ukrainian society, and is also due to the Kremlins massive financial investment prior to the invasion to weaken and corrupt Ukraine from within. However, all regions of Ukraine united to resist Russias invasion.\n\nA third key factor was the initial military assistance provided by partners such as the US, UK, Poland, and the Baltic states in the months immediately preceding the Russian invasion. These weapons deliveries helped Ukraine to keep fighting during the critical first weeks of the war and convinced the democratic world to begin sending more advanced and diverse arms supplies to the country.\n\nAlexander Motyl, Professor, Rutgers University: The Russian invasion has gone badly for several reasons. The Russians came awfully close to capturing Kyiv during the first weeks of the invasion but the Ukrainians fought hard and managed to stave off the immediate assault. Once that happened and the shock of the attack began to wear off, the Ukrainians rallied, while the Russians reverted to business as usual. That meant poor leadership, poor logistics, poor tactics, and poor strategy. These are all products of a modern Russian military system that squanders resources, ignores modernization, and promotes corruption.\n\nAbove all, the Russian performance has been undermined by Vladimir Putins constant interference in military affairs. Inevitably, his inexperience and arrogance have resulted in a series of poor decisions. The internal rot within the Russian armed forces thereby came to the fore and has been amply demonstrated throughout the war.\n\nWestern support has also been crucial. Once a Russian victory no longer seemed inevitable, once the Ukrainians proved they would fight and could survive, and once the Ukrainian military demonstrated that it knew how to fight effectively, the West overcame its initial skepticism and began to supply Ukraine with significant amounts of weapons and other resources.\n\nUltimately, of course, the underlying cause of Putins failing invasion is Russias chronic underestimation of Ukraine and Ukrainians. This is a cultural predisposition that manifests itself in the view that Ukrainians are incompetent and inferior, and are thus incapable of any kind of successful military campaign.\n\nMiriam Kosmehl, Senior Expert Eastern Europe and EU Neighborhood, Bertelsmann Stiftung: Vladimir Putin simply did not understand the strength of Ukrainian national identity or the durability of the state the Ukrainians had built. Due to his own fear of domestic uprisings against his rule, Putin has created a strong personal power vertical but not a strong Russian state. He made the mistake of assuming Ukraine was the same.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Putin badly underestimated Ukraine. When preparing to invade, he failed to recognize Ukraines deep-rooted commitment to the countrys independence and democratic future. Russia observed President Zelenskyys falling approval ratings along with the constant flow of criticism from Ukrainian civil society and drew the false conclusion that most Ukrainians would welcome change. This was a fundamental misreading of the situation.\n\nFor years prior to the invasion, the Russian security services had been preparing the ground by penetrating Ukrainian local government structures and recruiting Ukrainian officials to switch sides at the decisive moment and aid a Russian takeover. However, with the survival of the Ukrainian nation at stake, the vast majority of Ukrainians fought back. Russia completely misjudged this readiness of individual Ukrainians to fight for their country. When the full-scale Russian invasion began, huge numbers of Ukrainians flocked to join the army or territorial defense forces. Similarly, Moscow expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be a weak wartime leader. In hindsight, this may have been the biggest miscalculation of all!\n\nPutins disastrous failure to understand the realities of todays Ukraine was accompanied by similarly unrealistic expectations regarding the Wests likely response to a Russian invasion. Based on the muted Western reaction to earlier Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Putin believed he could count on a similarly underwhelming response. Instead, the West imposed tough sanctions and began unprecedented arms shipments to Ukraine.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

Putins War A Times investigation based on interviews, intercepts, documents and secret battle plans shows how a \"walk in the park\" became a catastrophe for Russia. They never had a chance. Fumbling blindly through cratered farms, the troops from Russias 155th Naval Infantry Brigade had no maps, medical kits or working walkie-talkies, they said. Just a few weeks earlier, they had been factory workers and truck drivers, watching an endless showcase of supposed Russian military victories at home on state television before being drafted in September. One medic was a former barista who had never had any medical training. Now, they were piled onto the tops of overcrowded armored vehicles, lumbering through fallow autumn fields with Kalashnikov rifles from half a century ago and virtually nothing to eat, they said. Russia had been at war most of the year, yet its army seemed less prepared than ever. In interviews, members of the brigade said some of them had barely fired a gun before and described having almost no bullets anyway, let alone air cover or artillery. But it didnt frighten them too much, they said. They would never see combat, their commanders had promised. Only when the shells began crashing around them, ripping their comrades to pieces, did they realize how badly they had been duped. Flung to the ground, a drafted Russian soldier named Mikhail recalled opening his eyes to a shock: the shredded bodies of his comrades littering the field. Shrapnel had sliced open his belly, too. Desperate to escape, he said, he crawled to a thicket of trees and tried to dig a ditch with his hands. Of the 60 members of his platoon near the eastern Ukrainian town of Pavlivka that day in late October, about 40 were killed, said Mikhail, speaking by phone from a military hospital outside Moscow. Only eight, he said, escaped serious injury. \"This isnt war,\" Mikhail said, struggling to speak through heavy, liquid breaths. \"Its the destruction of the Russian people by their own commanders.\" 1. Blunders It took four days for Russia to strike an obvious target. By then it was too late. 2. Hubris Putin summoned many of Russias most powerful businessmen into a trap. 3. Internal Rot The Kremlin spent big on the military. \"A new Potemkin village\" went up instead. 4. Collapsing Front As Russia stumbled, the U.S. tried to save a Russian generals life. 5. Divided Ranks The Russian tank blew up its own checkpoint. It was no accident. 6. Cannon Fodder At least your son didnt drink himself to death, Putin told a bereaved mother. President Vladimir V. Putins war was never supposed to be like this. When the head of the C.I.A. traveled to Moscow last year to warn against invading Ukraine, he found a supremely confident Kremlin, with Mr. Putins national security adviser boasting that Russias cutting-edge armed forces were strong enough to stand up even to the Americans. Russian invasion plans, obtained by The New York Times, show that the military expected to sprint hundreds of miles across Ukraine and triumph within days. Officers were told to pack their dress uniforms and medals in anticipation of military parades in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But instead of that resounding victory, with tens of thousands of his troops killed and parts of his army in shambles after nearly 10 months of war, Mr. Putin faces something else entirely: his nations greatest human and strategic calamity since the collapse of the Soviet Union. A dead Russian soldier in Kharkiv the day after the war started in February. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times How could one of the worlds most powerful militaries, led by a celebrated tactician like Mr. Putin, have faltered so badly against its much smaller, weaker rival? To piece together the answer, we drew from hundreds of Russian government emails, documents, invasion plans, military ledgers and propaganda directives. We listened to Russian phone calls from the battlefield and spoke with dozens of soldiers, senior officials and Putin confidants who have known him for decades. A Russian logbook detailing the movement of airborne troops from Belarus toward Kyiv, including attacks and \"nonstop fire\" by Ukrainian forces. Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. The Times investigation found a stunning cascade of mistakes that started with Mr. Putin profoundly isolated in the pandemic, obsessed with his legacy, convinced of his own brilliance and continued long after drafted soldiers like Mikhail were sent to the slaughter. At every turn, the failures ran deeper than previously known: In interviews, Putin associates said he spiraled into self-aggrandizement and anti-Western zeal, leading him to make the fateful decision to invade Ukraine in near total isolation, without consulting experts who saw the war as pure folly. Aides and hangers-on fueled his many grudges and suspicions, a feedback loop that one former confidant likened to the radicalizing effect of a social-media algorithm. Even some of the presidents closest advisers were left in the dark until the tanks began to move. As another longtime confidant put it, \"Putin decided that his own thinking would be enough.\" The Russian military, despite Western assumptions about its prowess, was severely compromised, gutted by years of theft. Hundreds of billions of dollars had been devoted to modernizing the armed forces under Mr. Putin, but corruption scandals ensnared thousands of officers. One military contractor described frantically hanging enormous patriotic banners to hide the decrepit conditions at a major Russian tank base, hoping to fool a delegation of top brass. The visitors were even prevented from going inside to use the bathroom, he said, lest they discover the ruse. Once the invasion began, Russia squandered its dominance over Ukraine through a parade of blunders. It relied on old maps and bad intelligence to fire its missiles, leaving Ukrainian air defenses surprisingly intact, ready to defend the country. Russias vaunted hacking squads tried, and failed, to win in what some officials call the first big test of cyberweapons in actual warfare. Russian soldiers, many shocked they were going to war, used their cellphones to call home, allowing the Ukrainians to track them and pick them off in large numbers. And Russias armed forces were so stodgy and sclerotic that they did not adapt, even after enduring huge losses on the battlefield. While their planes were being shot down, many Russian pilots flew as if they faced no danger, almost like they were at an air show. Stretched thin by its grand ambitions, Russia seized more territory than it could defend, leaving thousands of square miles in the hands of skeleton crews of underfed, undertrained and poorly equipped fighters. Many were conscripts or ragtag separatists from Ukraines divided east, with gear from the 1940s or little more than printouts from the internet describing how to use a sniper rifle, suggesting soldiers learned how to fight on the fly. With new weapons from the West in hand, the Ukrainians beat them back, yet Russian commanders kept sending waves of ground troops into pointless assaults, again and again. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" one Russian soldier said he realized after being ordered into a fifth march directly in the sights of Ukrainian artillery. Finally, he and his demoralized comrades refused to go. A Soviet-era map of modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia recovered from the battlefield. Mr. Putin divided his war into fiefs, leaving no one powerful enough to challenge him. Many of his fighters are commanded by people who are not even part of the military, like his former bodyguard, the leader of Chechnya and a mercenary boss who has provided catering for Kremlin events. As the initial invasion failed, the atomized approach only deepened, chipping away at an already disjointed war effort. Now, Mr. Putins fractured armies often function like rivals, competing for weapons and, at times, viciously turning on one another. One soldier recounted how the clashes became violent, with a Russian tank commander deliberately charging at his supposed allies and blowing up their checkpoint. Since the early days of the invasion, Mr. Putin has conceded, privately, that the war has not gone as planned. During a meeting in March with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, Mr. Putin admitted that the Ukrainians were tougher \"than I was told,\" according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"This will probably be much more difficult than we thought. But the war is on their territory, not ours. We are a big country and we have patience.\" People who know Mr. Putin say he is ready to sacrifice untold lives and treasure for as long as it takes, and in a rare face-to-face meeting with the Americans last month the Russians wanted to deliver a stark message to President Biden: No matter how many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded on the battlefield, Russia will not give up. One NATO member is warning allies that Mr. Putin is ready to accept the deaths or injuries of as many as 300,000 Russian troops roughly three times his estimated losses so far. Just days after facing blowback about the war from normally friendly leaders in September, Mr. Putin doubled down on the invasion, calling up hundreds of thousands of Russians in a draft that was supposed to turn the war in Russias favor, but has instead stirred growing anger at home. Soon after, hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed outside Pavlivka, including Mikhails drafted comrades in the blind advance of the 155th. \"Legs, guts. I mean, meat. Just meat,\" another member of the platoon, Aleksandr, said from a hospital in Russia. \"I know it sounds terrible, but you cant describe it any other way. People were turned into hamburger.\" Aleksandr recounted how he and his fellow draftees had asked their instructor in Russia what they could possibly learn about firing a gun and becoming soldiers in the few weeks before being sent to Ukraine. \"He was honest: Nothing,\" Aleksandr said the instructor responded.

Maps by Scott Reinhard. The more setbacks Mr. Putin endures on the battlefield, the more fears grow over how far he is willing to go. He has killed tens of thousands in Ukraine, leveled cities and targeted civilians for maximum pain obliterating hospitals, schools and apartment buildings, while cutting off power and water to millions before winter. Each time Ukrainian forces score a major blow against Russia, the bombing of their country intensifies. And Mr. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world that he can use anything at his disposal, including nuclear arms, to pursue his notion of victory. Emergency services at the site of a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia, in October. Nicole Tung for The New York Times As far back as January, with the United States warning that Russias invasion of Ukraine was imminent, a retired Russian general named Leonid Ivashov saw disaster on the horizon. In a rare open letter, he warned that using force against Ukraine would threaten \"the very existence of Russia as a state.\" In a recent phone interview, General Ivashov said that his warnings before the war echoed what he had been hearing from nervous Russian military officials at the time. Though the Kremlin insisted an invasion was not on the table, some could tell otherwise. Service members told him that \"victory in such a situation is impossible,\" he said, but their superiors told them not to worry. A war would be a \"walk in the park,\" they were told. The last 10 months, he went on, have turned out to be \"even more tragic\" than predicted. Nimble Ukrainian generals and soldiers have outmaneuvered a much bigger, more lethal foe. The West, cheered by Ukraines successes, has provided ever more powerful weapons to drive the Russians back. \"Never in its history has Russia made such stupid decisions,\" General Ivashov said. \"Alas, today stupidity has triumphed stupidity, greed, a kind of vengefulness and even a kind of malice.\" Mr. Putins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, blames the West, and the weapons it has given Ukraine, for Russias unexpected difficulties in the war. \"This is a big burden for us,\" Mr. Peskov said, depicting Russia as taking on all of NATOs military might in Ukraine. \"It was just very hard to believe in such cynicism and in such bloodthirstiness on the part of the collective West.\" Some of the wars original supporters are starting to reckon with the idea of defeat. Before the invasion, American intelligence agencies identified Oleg Tsaryov as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install once it took over Ukraine. His faith in the war has since slipped away.

The attack came by land, sea and air. The attack came by land, sea and air. As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. Oleksii bolted across the tarmac in the dark as the first Russian missiles landed, clambered into his Su-27 fighter jet and took off just as buildings across the airfield began to explode. \"At that moment, I understood that it was really something bad,\" said Oleksii, 26, on condition that only his first name and rank, captain, be used. Some other soldiers and officials in this article were not authorized to speak publicly, or faced reprisals. Just before 6 a.m. Moscow time, Mr. Putin declared the opening of his \"special military operation\" in a televised address. It began with an aerial bombardment to take out Ukraines air defenses, communications and radar installations to overwhelm its military and shatter its ability to fight back. More than 150 missiles thundered into Ukraine from bombers, submarines and ships. As many as 75 Russian aircraft streaked into Ukrainian skies, about the size of Ukraines entire working air combat fleet, analysts and officials said. On his radar screen, Oleksii saw the blips of incoming missiles and enemy aircraft before getting his orders: Fly to a backup air base in central Ukraine. When he landed, he was astonished. Not only was his unit there, but a good portion of Ukraines remaining air force as well. For days, he and his fellow pilots flew missions from their new base, wondering when Russian radar operators would finally notice them. A strike on their position could have been disastrous, gutting the Ukrainian defense, and the pilots assumed it was only a matter of time until one came. But it took four days for the Russians to attack, and most of the aircraft had moved to new locations by then, leaving Oleksii in amazement. \"It was really simple,\" he said. \"I dont know how they missed this opportunity.\" The failure to destroy Ukraines modest air defenses was one of the most significant blunders of the war, foiling Russias mighty air force early on. Interviews revealed why that happened and how the Ukrainians managed to stay a step ahead of their invaders. Russia invades Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Ukraine should have been overwhelmed. By one count, its fighter jets were outnumbered 15 to one in some early air battles. Russias planes were also more advanced, helping its pilots see farther and strike from greater distances. Russia had thousands of cruise and ballistic missiles that should have smothered Ukraines aging, Soviet-era defenses. That is what American and Ukrainian intelligence officials assumed, anyway, leading to predictions that Ukraine would fall within days. So, Ukraine shuffled the deck. It moved some of its defenses like Buk and S-300 missile launchers, along with its primary radio intelligence command and control center to new sites before the war began, senior Ukrainian officials said. Russian missiles often hit the old locations instead. In all, as many as 60 percent of Russian cruise missiles missed their intended targets, American officials said. Part of Russias problem was agility. Even if Russian forces had spotted Oleksii and his fellow pilots bunched together at their new rendezvous point, American officials said, Russias military was so rigid and centralized that it typically needed 48 to 72 hours to update its intelligence and get approval to go after new targets by which time the Ukrainians were gone. That same inflexibility made the Russians easy to hit. After failing to take out Ukraines defenses, many Russian pilots kept flying as if they had. Their ground-attack planes often flew sorties without backup from other fighter jets, the Ukrainians said, enabling outgunned pilots like Oleksii to catch them off-guard by flying at low altitudes, hidden from radar, and roaring up from below to shoot them down.

David Guttenfelder for The New York Times \"Maybe the Russian Army didnt read the Soviet books,\" Oleksii said. \"They flew straight without any cover. They had bombs, they had rockets, but they didnt cover their attack aircraft.\" Then in March, when Russian pilots finally changed tactics and started flying low enough to duck under Ukrainian air defense radar, they fell into the sights of Ukrainian missiles, including shoulder-fired Stingers provided by the United States. For Russian troops on the ground, it was a disaster. Without air cover, they were suddenly far more vulnerable, throwing their troubled march toward Kyiv and other large cities further into disarray. Though tens of thousands of them had amassed along Ukraines borders, hovering menacingly as if eager to strike, many never thought they were actually going to war. Like most of Russia, they figured it was just for show, to extract concessions from the West. Interviews with Russian soldiers show how stunned they were when the orders came to invade. Cpl. Nikita Chibrin, a 27-year-old soldier in a motorized infantry brigade, said he had spent the month before in Belarus on what he and his fellow soldiers were told was a training exercise. On Feb. 23, he said, he and his unit were at their camp celebrating the Defender of the Fatherland holiday, snacking on candy they had been given for the occasion, when their commander approached. \"Tomorrow you are going to Ukraine to fuck up some shit,\" he said the commander told them. There was no further explanation. Before dawn on the 24th, Corporal Chibrin and his comrades loaded into a tracked armored personnel carrier. They had no instructions and no idea where they were headed, he said. Another Russian soldier stationed in Belarus said he found out he was going to war only an hour before his unit began to march. The order was both simple and wildly optimistic: Follow the vehicle in front of you and reach Kyiv within 18 hours. According to the units schedule and logbook which were obtained by The Times and reviewed by three independent military analysts, who considered them authentic the first vehicles in his convoy were supposed to punch down from Belarus and arrive on the outskirts of Kyiv by 2:55 p.m., even faster than the soldier was told. A Russian military timetable showing a detailed schedule of movement for airborne troops set to depart Belarus, and arrive on Kyivs outskirts. Source: Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. He didnt come close. The massive vehicles were so heavy, ripping up the roads as they tried to move forward, that the convoy got bogged down immediately, the soldier said. It took more than a day just to cross the border into Ukraine. It got worse from there. The logbook recorded day after day of delays, Ukrainian attacks and hundreds of injuries, deaths and destroyed vehicles. Secret orders for a different Russian force obtained by The Times and shared with four independent military analysts, all of whom said they were credible were issued only hours before Mr. Putins announcement. The orders, for a unit of the 26th Tank Regiment, were oddly overconfident, to the point of being contradictory. They anticipated a tangle of possible resistance from Ukrainian troops and planes, yet they still laid out a mostly uninhibited, 24-hour dash from Ukraines border with Russia to a point across the Dnipro River, about 250 miles away. There, the unit would dig in, about two hours outside Kyiv, and block Ukrainian troops sweeping in from the south and east, the Russian war plans said. And no matter how fierce the enemy was, the unit was expected to complete the mission on its own. A document recovered from the 26th tank regiment detailing invasion plans issued on Feb. 23, 2022. \"There are no forces or equipment for reinforcements,\" the orders said. Sure enough, the lumbering, largely unprotected Russian columns proved enticing targets. On March 17, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukrainian forces, posted a video of burning tanks that he said belonged to the 26th Tank Regiment in northeastern Ukraine hundreds of kilometers short of its intended destination. The unit lost 16 vehicles in less than three weeks, according to Russian documents seized and published by Ukraine. The mother of one young tank soldier on the units roster told Russian media that her son was brought home in pieces, identified only by his DNA. Across Ukraine, the Russian losses mounted. A giant armored column of more than 30,000 troops at the core of Russias force pushing south toward the city of Chernihiv was eviscerated by a motley group of Ukrainian defenders outnumbered five to one, soldiers and senior officials said. The Ukrainians hid in the forest and picked apart the Russian column with shoulder-fired antitank weapons, like American-made Javelins. A Ukrainian soldier carrying an NLAW anti-tank guided missile as he walks toward a destroyed Russian armored column at a junction near Ivankiv, northwest of Kyiv, filmed between Feb. 24-26. Lyubov Shelkovich, via Facebook One Russian soldier in the unit said he was shocked by the swiftness of the Ukrainian attack. \"In the first battle, the column was ambushed, and I was wounded, and thats it,\" he said. \"For 24 hours, I was missing a leg, lying in a field waiting for my unit to come get me.\" The rout near Chernihiv spoiled part of Russias plan to envelop Kyiv. Ukrainian soldiers walking along a street where a column of Russian military vehicles was destroyed near Chernihiv in April. Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times A massacre at the Antonov Airport spoiled another. Russian forces had counted on the element of surprise when wave upon wave of helicopters descended on the airport, home to the largest aircraft in the world: the An-225 Mriya, a cargo plane with a 290-foot wingspan that was an object of Ukrainian national pride. Taking the airport would give Russian forces a beachhead to ferry in troops for the assault on Ukraines capital. But the Ukrainians expected as much. Using shoulder-fired missiles, they shot down Russian aircraft and killed as many as 300 Russian paratroopers, according to senior American and Ukrainian officials and the captured Russian logbook. Fierce battles in the following days destroyed much of the airport, including the prized Mriya cargo jet, but thwarted Russias plans. \"Yes, we lost our Mriya,\" said Col. Yuriy Ignat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force Command. \"But as a result the airport wasnt lost.\" Russia not only botched the attack by land and air, but also put too much faith in another wing of its vaunted arsenal: hacking. Even before the first missiles and shots were fired, unit 74455 of the Russian Military Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., tried to infiltrate Ukrainian networks and shut them down. Officials in Washington, who had been working closely with the Ukrainians to bolster their cyberdefenses for years, had been holding their breath. States had mainly used hacking for acts of espionage and financial thievery, for subversion and sabotage. But nobody really knew how it would play out in a full-scale military conflict. \"All this stuff that has been written about cyberwar has been speculative,\" said a senior U.S. defense official. \"For the first time, you have war and cyber together the real thing.\" The Russian hacking unit, known as Sandworm, had long menaced Ukraine, waging attacks against the power grid starting in 2015. But it was labor intensive, and only somewhat effective. By one estimate, it took Sandworm about 19 months to prepare the attack on a power station in western Ukraine, yet it only caused a six-hour power outage. A snippet of code used by hackers to try to disable Ukrainian government computers. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency A cyber cat-and-mouse game ensued, with the United States, Britain and other allies helping to shore up Ukrainian computers and stave off Russian intrusions. On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained. Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors another fail. Sandworm wasnt done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian militarys satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraines most vulnerable moment. It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion. Russia had assumed its forces would march largely uncontested into Kyiv. When that didnt happen, American officials suspect that Sandworm like the rest of the Russian military was caught off guard. Soon, Russias missteps went from the sophisticated to the mundane. With their plans for a speedy victory stymied, Russian forces were suddenly confronted with the most basic of problems: They hadnt brought enough food, water or other supplies for a prolonged campaign. Soldiers resorted to looting grocery stores, hospitals and homes. Security camera footage showing Russian soldiers looting a shop, said to be in Kherson, on Feb. 28. u_now, via Telegram \"The guys were going from apartment to apartment and taking out large bags looting in all its glory,\" one Russian soldier wrote in mid-March in his diary, which was recovered by Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine and shared with a Times reporter embedded with them. \"Some take only what they need, some take everything, from old nonfunctional phones to plasma TVs, computers, and expensive alcohol.\" In the diary, the soldier recounts hunting for medicine, food and other essentials, describing the joy his men felt entering a grocery store. \"We found everything that we lacked so much, even sweets,\" the soldier wrote. \"Everyone rejoiced like children.\" A page from the diary of a Russian soldier, recovered by Ukrainian troops, that described scavenging for candy and socks. He recounts nearly dying in a mortar attack and stalking a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier. But just as often, he appears concerned with basic provisions for himself and his comrades, describing how they scoured a hospital and came up with jam, cookies and raisins. Two days later, he had more luck. \"I found socks that are now worth their weight in gold,\" he wrote. Some Russian troops panicked, and even resorted to self-sabotage. One Pentagon intelligence report said that Russian military drivers were poking holes in their gas tanks, disabling their own vehicles to avoid going into battle. The commander of a Ukrainian tank repair depot said some 30 Russian T-80 tanks in seemingly perfect condition were taken and delivered to him at the beginning of the war. When his mechanics inspected, they found sand had been poured into the fuel tanks, rendering them inoperable. Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus. Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time. \"We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,\" said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. \"They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.\" Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets. \"We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,\" the official said. The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraines armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the units location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said. The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence. They stayed. \"We didnt lose Ukraine. We didnt let the enemy move further,\" the official said. \"On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.\"\n\nHubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Consumed by his legacy, stewing in resentment against the West, Mr. Putin drove his country to war to seal his place in Russian history. Hubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him.

He boasted of wielding a modernized military behemoth, a far cry from its post-Soviet shell. Watching from afar, the West believed him. William J. Burns, the director of the C.I.A., flew to Moscow, sat in a conference room near the Kremlin and waited until the formalities were over before explaining the real reason he had come. It was early November 2021. The United States believed Mr. Putin was considering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Burns explained. If he proceeded down this path, Mr. Burns warned, the West would respond decisively, in unison and the consequences for Russia would be severe. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Mr. Putins security council, stiffened and looked Mr. Burns in the eye, officials in the room said. He abandoned his notes and extolled the prowess of Russias armed forces. They had been so thoroughly modernized under Mr. Putin that they now rivaled the United States militarily, he said. \"Patrushev didnt qualify it,\" said John Sullivan, the American ambassador to Russia at the time, who was there. \"He was just looking at Burns and saying: We can do this. Were back. The way I would describe it was that this was already decided, and they were supremely confident. His message was, Its not going to be a problem for us to do what we want to do.\" Mr. Burns briefed Mr. Biden upon his return to Washington, officials said. Mr. Putin had all but made up his mind to take over Ukraine, Mr. Burns told him, and the Russians had absolute confidence victory would come swiftly. To Mr. Putin, Ukraine is an artificial nation, used by the West to weaken Russia. He describes it as a cradle of Russian culture, a centerpiece of Russian identity that must be wrested back from the West and returned to Russias orbit. In his eyes, that is the biggest unfinished mission of his 22 years in power, people who know him say. He began as an unassuming bureaucrat-turned-president on New Years Eve, 1999, seen by the inner circle of his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, as a proficient manager who could bring stability without threatening the ruling elite. By his third decade in power, Mr. Putin seems transformed, people who have known him since the 1990s say. He styles himself as a pivotal figure astride a millennium of Russian history as he hinted when he unveiled a statue of Vladimir the Great, the medieval prince of Kyiv, outside the Kremlin walls in 2016. That Vladimir \"entered history as a uniter and protector of Russian lands,\" Mr. Putin said. The Vladimir at Russias helm in the 21st century, Mr. Putin has increasingly made plain, sees himself as carrying on that tradition. \"If everyone around you is telling you for 22 years that you are a super-genius, then you will start to believe that this is who you are,\" said Oleg Tinkov, a former Russian banking tycoon who turned against Mr. Putin this year. \"Russian businesspeople, Russian officials, the Russian people they saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Mr. Putin rose to power as a deft politician. He could flash charm, humility and a smile, painting himself as a reasonable leader to Russians and foreigners. He knew how to control his facial muscles in tense conversations, leaving his eyes as the only guide to his emotions, people who know him said. But during his presidency, he increasingly wallowed in a swirl of grievances and obsessions: the Wests supposed disregard for the Soviet Unions role in defeating Nazi Germany; the fear that NATO would base nuclear missiles in Ukraine to strike Moscow; modern-day gender politics in which, Mr. Putin often says, Mom and Dad are being replaced by \"Parent No. 1 and Parent No. 2.\" In the personalist system he has built, those quirks have global consequences. \"What he thinks about obsessively, and quite possibly falsely,\" has ended up shaping \"the biography of the whole world,\" said Konstantin Remchukov, a Moscow newspaper editor. Mr. Putin seemed to think that only he truly understood Ukraine. After annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, Mr. Putin bragged that he had overruled his own advisers, who had considered the move too dangerous because of the risk of sanctions and a Ukrainian military response. Back then, Mr. Putins instincts mostly proved right. The Ukrainian military withdrew swiftly from Crimea some soldiers and sailors switched sides to join Russia and the Wests limited sanctions scarcely affected Russias economy, sealing Mr. Putins confidence. \"I took responsibility for everything,\" Mr. Putin said after taking Crimea, according to a confidant. \"I will be gone sooner or later, but Crimea will have been returned to Russia forever.\" A pro-Russian rally on Crimea in 2014, the year Russia seized the peninsula. Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Many of the people closest to Mr. Putin had an incentive to cater to the bosss rising self-regard and to magnify the external threats and historical injustices that Mr. Putin saw himself as fighting against. A former Putin confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social media algorithm, feeding users content that provokes an emotional reaction. \"They read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff,\" he said. By the summer of 2021, during a meeting that was supposed to be about the economy, Mr. Putin railed instead against the West and President George W. Bushs withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, which Mr. Putin often cites as one of Americas great post-Cold War sins. \"We tried to partner with the West for many years, but the partnership was not accepted, it didnt work,\" Mr. Putin said, recalled his guest, who sat on the other end of a long table. The words had a sort of finality to them, the visitor said: \"It was like he was talking to himself, not to me.\" The guest had spent three days in quarantine before meeting with Mr. Putin at a distance of roughly 15 feet. It was a \"light\" option the Kremlin offered to people who sought face time with Mr. Putin but wanted to avoid the lengthy quarantines required for an up-close meeting with him, even in the pandemics second year. Mr. Putin meeting with his defense minister and a top military official in February. The photo was released by Russian state media. Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik, via Reuters Mr. Putins isolation deepened his radicalization, people who know him say. He went 16 months without meeting a single Western leader in person. He held just about all his meetings by videoconference from nondescript rooms that left his exact location a mystery. Those who got to see him in person saw their influence rise in a system in which access to Mr. Putin referred to as \"the boss\" or \"V.V.,\" his first initials, by insiders is the most valuable of currencies. \"Our most important resource is not a medal, not money and not possession of anything,\" said Konstantin Zatulin, a member of Parliament in Mr. Putins United Russia party. \"Our main, most important resource is access to the president.\" On that score, Yuri Kovalchuk, a conservative physicist and banking magnate who befriended Mr. Putin in the 1990s, did well during the pandemic. Mr. Kovalchuk bragged last year that he had spent several months in 2020 with Mr. Putin at his residence on Lake Valdai, between St. Petersburg and Moscow, according to a person who met with him then. Mr. Kovalchuk told the person that Mr. Putins main achievement was \"militarization\" the creation of an army and a society ready for war. The secretive Mr. Kovalchuk prides himself as a strategist who sees Russia locked in an existential battle with the West, according to people who know him. In the last decade, he has expanded his television and newspaper holdings, key parts of the Kremlins propaganda apparatus. A onetime Putin confidant said Mr. Kovalchuk sees himself \"as a visionary,\" and the pandemic, given the extraordinary precautions Mr. Putin took, emerged as an opportunity for Mr. Kovalchuk to deepen his imprint on the president and the nation. Mr. Putins unfinished business with Ukraine also fed a growing personal animus toward Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, at a news conference in Kyiv in March. Lynsey Addario for The New York Times When Mr. Zelensky was elected in a landslide in 2019, the Kremlin saw him as someone it could work with: a Russian-speaking comedian who had lived in Moscow, performed on Russian television and won with a message of ending the war in eastern Ukraine that Russia had fueled. And partly because Mr. Zelensky is Jewish, some in Moscow expected him to be tough on Ukraines nationalist wing, which venerated Ukrainian independence fighters who had fought alongside the Nazis in the closing battles of World War II. \"I think he is sincerely willing\" to compromise with Russia, Mr. Putin said of Mr. Zelensky in 2019. \"It is his sincere conviction, at least his striving.\" By early 2021, the Kremlins hopes had been dashed. Mr. Zelensky cracked down on pro-Russian interests in Ukraine, shutting down pro-Russian television channels and sanctioning Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch close to Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin showed his frustration in a long meeting at his Sochi residence with Mr. Bennett, the new prime minister of Israel, in October 2021. Mr. Putin charmed his guest, taking him into his private residence and pouring him a glass of whiskey. But when it came to Ukraine, Mr. Putin flashed anger. Mr. Bennett noted that Mr. Zelensky was interested in meeting Mr. Putin face to face. \"I have nothing to discuss with this person,\" Mr. Putin shot back, according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"What kind of Jew is he? Hes an enabler of Nazism.\" Some Western officials believe that, by that point, Mr. Putin may have already decided to go to war. But in Russia, even among those with access to Mr. Putin or his inner circle, almost no one thought that the president was seriously considering a full-scale invasion, people close to the Kremlin said. They were sure he was bluffing. Mr. Remchukov, the newspaper editor, was one of them. As the chairman of the 2018 election campaign of Mayor Sergei S. Sobyanin of Moscow Mr. Putins former chief of staff he felt well-connected enough to happily announce to his wife a week before the invasion, \"Lena, there wont be a war!\" That day, he had met for two hours with several senior military officials. Rather than betray any hint of tension, they bantered about Mr. Remchukovs newly svelte physique, queried him in detail about his weight-loss regimen and casually discussed their vacation plans for early March. After he came home and described the meeting to his wife, he said, \"she kissed me and said: What happiness!\" The Americans, by contrast, feared the worst. On Feb. 22, two days before the invasion, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, went to the Pentagon and said his nation desperately needed Stingers, the shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III offered to help before asking how the Ukrainian government planned to keep running after the Russians invaded. \"If you get pushed out of Kyiv,\" he said, \"where are you going to go?\" Mr. Kuleba replied: \"I cant even acknowledge that. Were not even going to talk about that or think about that.\" \"Yeah, I got that,\" Mr. Austin said. \"But you need a plan.\" Soon, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined in, launching into what a senior American defense official described as a \"youre going to die speech.\" \"Theyre going to roll into Kyiv in a few days,\" General Milley said. \"Theyre coming in with tanks and columns of formations. You need to be ready for that. You need to be prepared. If youre not, its going to be a slaughter.\" As General Milley spoke, Mr. Kuleba and members of his delegation sat back in their chairs, their eyes widening. The Ukrainian air force had trained with NATO members since 2011, and the partnership deepened after Russia took Crimea in 2014. Wary of another invasion, they carried out combat exercises in Ukraine and California, preparing the nations air force to take on its technologically superior enemy. In February, a secretive U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard team called Grey Wolf was set up at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to support the Ukrainians. But General Milley still harbored serious doubts about Ukraines state of readiness. He had walked the halls of the Pentagon that winter with an enormous green map of Ukraine, with increasingly ominous projections from U.S. intelligence agencies of Russias invasion plans. Whats more, the American defense attach at the embassy in Kyiv had spent weeks trying to get Ukraines defensive plans, and the ones she received minimized, in the Pentagons view, the Russian threat. Mr. Austin seemed somewhat uncomfortable at General Milleys blunt admonishment of the Ukrainian foreign minister and chimed in, reassuringly: \"Were going to do what we can to help these guys.\" The reality was slow to sink in for many in Moscow, too. Mr. Zatulin, a senior Putin ally in Russias Parliament, said he got his first inkling that the president was serious about an invasion in mid-February. Though known as a leading expert on Ukraine, Mr. Zatulin said he was never consulted on the possibility. To the contrary, Mr. Zatulin said he was scheduled to give an address to the Russian Parliament on behalf of Mr. Putins United Russia party on Feb. 15 that was supposed to signal the opposite that there would be no invasion unless Mr. Zelensky himself went on the offensive in Ukraines divided east. But just five minutes before the session was scheduled to start, Mr. Zatulin said, he got a message from an aide: The partys leadership had canceled his speech. \"I was not ready for this turn of events,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"Everything connected to this decision turned out to be a surprise not just for me, but also for a great many of the people in power.\" Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putins spokesman, insisted that he found out about the invasion only once it had begun. Likewise, Anton Vaino, Mr. Putins chief of staff, and Aleksei Gromov, Mr. Putins powerful media adviser, also said they did not know in advance, according to people who spoke to them about it. The best that senior aides could do was to try to read Mr. Putins body language. Some reported with concern that \"hes got this warlike twinkle in his eyes,\" a person close to the Kremlin said. Russian howitzers being loaded onto train cars at a station outside Taganrog, Russia, days before the invasion. The New York Times Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said that amid Russias military buildup around Ukraine late last year, a deputy minister asked him if he knew what was going to happen. \"That means that no one has told the deputy minister,\" Mr. Markov said. \"Even some members\" of Russias security council \"werent told until the last moment.\" Many elites found out too late. Russias main industrial association had been expecting to meet with Mr. Putin in February. On the agenda, among other things: the regulation of cryptocurrencies. But the meeting kept getting rescheduled, until finally, on Feb. 22 or Feb. 23, the Kremlin notified participants of the date: Feb. 24, the day Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. Andrey Melnichenko, a coal and fertilizer billionaire in that lobbying group, described how he woke up that day to the \"madness\" in Ukraine. But the meeting with Mr. Putin was still on, so a few hours later, he was at the Kremlin, as scheduled. In an anteroom, stunned tycoons were munching on sandwiches while awaiting the results of their coronavirus swabs to clear them to share Mr. Putins air. When Mr. Putin finally appeared, the television cameras were rolling. He told the assembled billionaires that he had no choice but to invade. Mr. Putin met with a group of Russian oligarchs at the Kremlin on Feb. 24. \"What happened, in my view, is irrational,\" said Mr. Melnichenko, describing his reaction to the invasion. \"It was shock.\" Another magnate recalled realizing too late that Mr. Putin was parading them in front of the television cameras, for all the world to see, for a carefully planned purpose. The point was \"specifically to tar everyone there,\" he said, \"to get everyone sanctioned.\" There was no going back. They, like the rest of Russia, were in this with Mr. Putin now. Sure enough, Mr. Melnichenko and all the other businessmen who appeared with Mr. Putin that day were hit with sanctions by the West in the months that followed.\n\nDate : 3/5/2022 From : pressa@fsb.ru The distribution of humanitarian aid to local residents was organized March 3-4 of this year in the city of Melitopol on Victory Square ATTENTION MEDIA!

Defeats became accomplishments, as if reflected through a carnival mirror. Despite Russias humiliating failure to seize Ukraines capital, its military sent TV crews a video about Ukrainians supposedly throwing down their NATO-provided guns. As Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv in March, the F.S.B. boasted about the heroics of Russian special forces, claiming they stopped Ukrainians who terrorized pro-Russian civilians.

In some cases, the agency even offered language to hide the source of the information: \"A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE POWER STRUCTURES OF RUSSIA!!!!\" The messages, drawn from tens of thousands of emails leaked from Russias largest state-owned media company and reviewed by The Times, show how at least one engine of the Russian war effort purred along smoothly: the nations propaganda machine. At times, Russias military and the F.S.B. directed coverage down to the video clips played and the time of publication. The emails, leaked from V.G.T.R.K., the state media giant that oversees some of Russias most-watched channels, portrayed Mr. Putins military as backed into a corner by NATO. Once the full invasion began, the machine downplayed Russian atrocities, bolstered conspiracy theories and tried to portray Ukrainian troops as abandoning their posts. (After the emails were released by a group that publishes hacked documents, The Times verified the documents by confirming identities, email addresses and broadcasts on the air.) Off camera, state media employees had little to no idea what was actually happening. A state television journalist said in an interview that as late as April, his Kremlin sources were still assuring him that the war would be over within days. A pro-Russian Ukrainian politician called for Mr. Zelensky to resign on a Russian state-run news channel. \"Tomorrow morning, therell be a statement,\" the journalist recalled one of his sources saying, only to be proved wrong the next day. \"It was really kind of weird.\" But while state broadcasters kept delivering upbeat assessments, Mr. Putin privately acknowledged that his military was struggling. During the meeting in March with Mr. Bennett of Israel when Mr. Putin conceded that the war would be \"much more difficult than we thought\" he returned to the theme that has become a fixation of his presidency: his place in Russian history. Ukraine recaptures the North Kyiv Kharkiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine Kherson CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA \"I wont be the Russian leader who stood by and did nothing,\" he told Mr. Bennett, according to two people familiar with the exchange. Once again, Mr. Putin seemed convinced that future generations of Russians could be threatened by the West. He had spent years preparing for precisely such a clash, devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to Russias military, supposedly to modernize it and strip out the corruption that had sapped it in the 1990s. But while Russia made significant headway, Western officials said, a culture of graft and fraud persisted under Mr. Putin that emphasized loyalty above honesty, or even skill. The result was a hodgepodge of elite troops and bedraggled conscripts, advanced tanks and battalions that were powerful only on paper. \"Everyone was stealing and lying. This was a Soviet, and now Russian, tradition,\" said Col. Vaidotas Malinionis, a retired Lithuanian commander who served in the Soviet military in the 1980s. Looking at satellite images of the army camp where he served, he said the old barracks and mess hall were still there, with no sign of modernization, and a few buildings had fallen down. \"There has been no evolution at all, only regression,\" he said. European, American and Ukrainian officials warned against underestimating Russia, saying it had improved after its muddled invasion of Georgia in 2008. The defense minister overhauled the armed forces, forcibly retired about 40,000 officers and tried to impose more transparency on where money went. \"He made a lot of enemies,\" said Dara Massicot, a RAND researcher who studies the Russian military. Then, in 2012, that minister in charge of dragging the military out of its post-Soviet dysfunction became embroiled in a corruption scandal himself. Mr. Putin replaced him with Sergei K. Shoigu, who had no military experience but was seen as someone who could smooth ruffled feathers. \"Russia drew a lot of lessons from the Georgia war and started to rebuild their armed forces, but they built a new Potemkin village,\" said Gintaras Bagdonas, the former head of Lithuanias military intelligence. Much of the modernization drive was \"just pokazukha,\" he said, using a Russian term for window-dressing. Contractors like Sergei Khrabrykh, a former Russian Army captain, were recruited into the stagecraft. He said he got a panicked call in 2016 from a deputy defense minister. A delegation of officials was scheduled to tour a training base of one of Russias premier tank units, the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, whose history dates to the victories of World War II. Billions of rubles had been allocated for the base, Mr. Khrabrykh said, but most of the money was gone and virtually none of the work had been done. He said the minister begged him to transform it into a modern-looking facility before the delegation arrived. \"They needed to be guided around the territory and shown that the Kantemirovskaya Division was the coolest,\" Mr. Khrabrykh said. He was given about $1.2 million and a month to do the job. As he toured the base, Mr. Khrabrykh was stunned by the dilapidation. The Ministry of Defense had hailed the tank division as a unit that would defend Moscow in case of a NATO invasion. But the barracks were unfinished, with debris strewn across the floors, large holes in the ceiling and half-built cinder-block walls, according to photos Mr. Khrabrykh and his colleagues took. A tangle of electrical wires hung from a skinny pole. \"Just about everything was destroyed,\" he said. The interior of a tank base building. Sergei Khrabrykh The same base after work was done to cover up its state. Sergei Khrabrykh Before the delegation arrived, Mr. Khrabrykh said, he quickly constructed cheap facades and hung banners, covered in pictures of tanks and boasting the army was \"stronger and sturdier year by year,\" to disguise the worst of the decay. On the tour, he said, the visitors were guided along a careful route through the best-looking part of the base and kept away from the bathrooms, which had not been repaired. After the invasion started, the Kantemirovskaya Division pressed into northeastern Ukraine, only to be ravaged by Ukrainian forces. Crews limped away with many of their tanks abandoned or destroyed. Russian prosecutors have pursued thousands of officers and others for corruption in recent years: One colonel was accused of embezzling money meant for vehicle batteries, another of fraud around mobile kitchens. The deputy chief of the general staff was charged with defrauding the state over radio gear, and a major general sentenced to prison in the case. In 2019, Russias chief military prosecutor said that more than 2,800 officers had been disciplined over corruption violations in the past year alone. After the invasion, American officials noticed that much of Russias equipment was poorly manufactured or in short supply. Tires on wheeled vehicles fell apart, stalling convoys, while soldiers resorted to crowdfunding for clothes, crutches and other basic supplies as the war wore on. But even more consequential than the corruption, officials and analysts said, were the ways Mr. Putin fundamentally misunderstood his own military. Russia had, in fact, spent 20 years getting ready for a radically different kind of war. It had not prepared its military to invade and occupy a country as big and powerful as Ukraine, officials and analysts said. Instead, Russia had largely organized its military to keep U.S. and NATO forces away by inflicting maximum damage from afar. Central to this strategy was a series of outposts Kaliningrad by the Baltic, Crimea in the Black Sea, and the Syrian port of Tartus on the Mediterranean to use long-range missiles to keep Western forces at bay. In the event of conflict, Russia intended to blind the enemy and destroy it from a distance, American officials said. But in this case, Russia did not crush Ukraine with weeks of missile strikes in advance. It marched in quickly with forces on the ground. Unlike its more limited campaigns in places like Syria or the big hypothetical war with NATO it had long planned for the invasion of Ukraine was simply \"not what the Russian military was designed to do,\" putting it in a position it was probably \"least prepared\" to deal with, said Clint Reach, a researcher at RAND. In other words, the Kremlin picked the \"stupidest\" of all potential military options by rushing forward and trying to take over Ukraine, said General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. Russia had not trained its infantry, air and artillery forces to work in concert, move quickly and then do it all again from a new location, officials said. It did not have a clear Plan B after the march on Kyiv failed, and commanders had long been afraid to report bad news to their bosses. Russian aims get smaller Throughout the summer, Russia makes incremental gains in the East.

The mounting failures drove a cadre of pro-Russian military bloggers to a boiling point. While still cheerleaders for the war, they began to openly criticize Russias performance. \"Ive been keeping quiet for a long time,\" the blogger Yuri Podolyaka said in May, after hundreds of soldiers died in a river crossing. \"Due to stupidity I emphasize, because of the stupidity of the Russian command at least one battalion tactical group was burned, possibly two.\" A Ukrainian soldier atop an abandoned Russian tank at a river crossing where hundreds of Russian soldiers died. Ivor Prickett for The New York Times The fury eventually reached Mr. Putin himself. On the sidelines of his marquee annual economic conference in St. Petersburg in June, the president held a meeting that had become a tradition: a sit-down with news media chiefs. This time, though, the bloggers were the headline guests. Mr. Putin sat alone at one end in a cavernous hall, according to one attendee, who provided a photo of the private gathering. Some of the bloggers took the floor and peppered Mr. Putin with messages and complaints from the front. \"It became a very concrete conversation, a surprising one for us,\" the person present said. \"Wed never had such conversations.\" It appeared to the person there that Russias intelligence agencies were using the bloggers to shift the blame for the wars failings to the Ministry of Defense. Mr. Zatulin, the Putin ally in Parliament, insisted he supported the war, but said a blame game has broken out, and took a side himself. \"Of course, to a certain degree, we now have an element of everyone wanting to dump the responsibility on someone else,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"But I think that the main miscalculations,\" he added, \"were made by the Defense Ministry and the General Staff\" the militarys top brass.\n\nCollapsing Front\n\n\"Nobody is going to stay alive.\" Ruslan was 54 years old, at war in Ukraine, and seemed to be learning to use his weapon on the fly.

With his marksmans rifle, bundle of papers and copies of his Russian passport in his pack, Ruslan was one of thousands of poorly trained, underequipped men asked to defend a huge swath of territory that Russia had seized in northeastern Ukraine. By summers end, Russian leaders had sent their best troops far to the south, leaving skeleton crews behind. So when the Ukrainians swept in and attacked the northeast, hoping to recapture occupied land, soldiers like Ruslan were cut down or melted away in a chaotic retreat. Military analysts had warned of such a danger before the invasion. Even as tens of thousands of Russian soldiers massed ominously along Ukraines borders, they said, the Kremlin had not sent enough to occupy the entire country. The Russian war plans for the 26th Tank Regiment signaled the same problem: Expect no reinforcements. Russia managed to take territory, frequently at enormous cost. But how to keep it was often an afterthought. \"The army, the generals, the soldiers werent ready,\" said Mr. Tsaryov, the man American officials identified as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install in Ukraine. A kindergarten classroom near Izium was used as a base by retreating Russian soldiers and emblazoned with the military symbol \"Z\" in September. Nicole Tung for The New York Times He said the Russian Army had spread itself so thin across Ukraine after invading that it \"would move through cities and not leave behind even a garrison, even a small one to stick up a Russian flag and defend it.\" In the northeastern region of Kharkiv, Russian commanders put men like Ruslan at roadblocks and moved on.

The rifle next to him suggested he was a sniper. But while snipers in modern militaries often go through weeks of additional special training, Ruslans teacher appeared to be the internet. \"Hello dear soldier!\" read the unsigned letter in his pack. \"You have to risk your life so that we can live peacefully. Thanks to you and your comrades our army remains so strong, mighty and can protect us from any enemy.\" More than 50 pages of Russian documents, collected from three towns in the Kharkiv region and reviewed by The Times, show a timeless truth: Foot soldiers bear the outsize burden of combat. The documents shared with three independent military experts, who considered them credible detail how Russia relied on bedraggled backup forces, many of them separatist fighters from Ukraines long conflict in its divided east, to hold territory as the regular Russian Army fought hundreds of miles away. The 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine was one of them. It had nearly 2,000 men, but was almost completely dependent on foot soldiers. More than a dozen pages of its rosters detail the particulars of the units suffering, down to a lack of warm clothing and boots. Several of its soldiers were in their 50s, including one who experienced \"cardiac failure,\" while one of its youngest casualties, a 20-year-old named Vladimir, endured \"frostbite of the lower limbs.\" Yet another complained on a phone call intercepted by the Ukrainians that he had no armored vest and a helmet from the 1940s. An excerpt from a roster of soldiers from the 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic. \"Our battalion, for instance, has already gone more than three weeks without receiving ammunition from the army,\" the pro-Russian militia commander, Mr. Khodakovsky, said on Telegram in September. In an interview, another soldier described having only the vaguest sense of how to use his weapon. He recounted being advised to fire judiciously, one round at a time, rather than blasting his rifle uncontrollably. But he wasnt sure how to do that. So, shortly before going into combat, he said, he turned to a commander and asked how to switch his rifle off fully automatic. Russia came to rely on such battered, inexperienced troops after months of tactics that more closely resembled 1917 than 2022. Commanders sent waves of troops into the range of heavy artillery, eking out a few yards of territory at grievous tolls. When one Russian unit arrived in eastern Ukraine, it was quickly whittled down to a haggard few, according to one of its soldiers. During fighting in the spring, he said, his commanders ordered an offensive, promising artillery to support the attack. It never came, he said, and his unit was devastated. Yet commanders sent them right back into the melee all the same. \"How much time has passed now? Nine months, I think?\" he said. \"In this whole time, nothing has changed. They have not learned. They have not drawn any conclusions from their mistakes.\" He recounted another battle in which commanders sent soldiers down the same path to the front, over and over. On each trip, he said, bodies fell around him. Finally, after being ordered to go a fifth time, he and his unit refused to go, he said. In all, he said, his unit lost about 70 percent of its soldiers to death and injury, ruining any faith he had in his commanders. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" he said. \"One way or another, one weapon or another is going to kill you.\" American officials realized early on that they had vastly overestimated Russias military. The morale of rank-and-file soldiers was so low, the Americans said, that Russia began moving its generals to the front lines to shore it up. But the generals made a deadly mistake: They positioned themselves near antennas and communications arrays, making them easy to find, the Americans said. Ukraine started killing Russian generals, yet the risky Russian visits to the front lines continued. Finally, in late April, the Russian chief of the general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, made secret plans to go himself. American officials said they found out, but kept the information from the Ukrainians, worried they would strike. Killing General Gerasimov could sharply escalate the conflict, officials said, and while the Americans were committed to helping Ukraine, they didnt want to set off a war between the United States and Russia. The Ukrainians learned of the generals plans anyway, putting the Americans in a bind. After checking with the White House, senior American officials asked the Ukrainians to call off the attack. \"We told them not to do it,\" a senior American official said. \"We were like, Hey, thats too much.\" The message arrived too late. Ukrainian military officials told the Americans that they had already launched their attack on the general's position. Dozens of Russians were killed in the strike, officials said. General Gerasimov wasnt one of them. Russian military leaders scaled back their visits to the front after that.\n\nDivided Ranks\n\n\"Wagner almost always fights alone.\" They deployed tanks, heavy artillery and fighter jets.

To join in Mr. Putins war, he has recruited prisoners, trashed the Russian military and competed with it for weapons. To join in Mr. Putins war, he has recruited prisoners, trashed the Russian military and competed with it for weapons. More than 20 years into a murder sentence, Yevgeny Nuzhin saw his chance at salvation swoop in by helicopter. Mr. Prigozhin the close confidant of Mr. Putin, known for stirring up trouble across the Middle East and Africa with his mercenary army, Wagner came to Mr. Nuzhins prison south of Moscow in August, looking for recruits. Heaving with patriotic fervor, Mr. Prigozhin gave the kind of speech he has delivered at other Russian prisons in recent months, some shared online. In one, also from August, Mr. Prigozhin, dressed in a drab beige uniform, promised pardons for the inmates who made it back from Ukraine alive. Those who didnt, he said, would \"be buried in the alleys of the heroes.\" He also issued a warning: Anyone thinking of deserting his forces once in Ukraine, he said in the video, would be shot. Mr. Nuzhin accepted Mr. Prigozhins offer, but ignored the warning. After two days at the front, where he spent his time collecting the bodies of dead Wagner soldiers, he used the cover of darkness to slip away and surrender to Ukrainian troops. \"What good has Putin done in the time that he has been in power? Has he done anything good?\" Mr. Nuzhin told The Times after being taken into Ukrainian custody. \"I think this war is Putins grave.\" Yevgeny Nuzhin, 55, a Russian prisoner of war held by Ukraine, in October. Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times Mr. Putins reliance on mercenaries and convicts is one of the more unusual features of his war in Ukraine. Mr. Prigozhin is just one of a handful of strongmen active in the war, all of them managed by Mr. Putin, who has carved up the administration of much of Russia into competing fiefs run by people loyal to him above all. Beyond the mercenaries controlled by Mr. Prigozhin, who rose to prominence as a caterer of Kremlin events, there is also the Russian national guard, overseen by Mr. Putins former bodyguard. And there is the unit commanded by the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov whose fighters were found and attacked because of their misadventures on TikTok. As far as officials can tell, the Russian military has limited coordination with any of them. \"There was no unified command, there was no single headquarters, there was no single concept and there was no unified planning of actions and command,\" said General Ivashov, the retired Russian officer who warned the war would go badly. \"It was destined to be a defeat.\" The splintered Russian forces have sparred openly. After Russian forces withdrew from northeast Ukraine in late summer, Mr. Kadyrov called for the Russian commander responsible to be demoted to private and shipped to the front, \"to wash his shame away with blood.\" Mr. Prigozhin weighed in, too: \"All these bastards should go with machine guns barefoot to the front.\" The public finger-pointing has added to a sense of disarray within the Russian war effort. Mr. Putin has replaced several top military commanders. Yet he has stuck with Mr. Shoigu, his defense minister, and with General Gerasimov, the chief of the militarys general staff, because firing them would amount to a public acknowledgment that the war is going badly, an admission Mr. Putin is loath to make, argued General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. \"They are still trying to maintain the illusion that everything is going well,\" he said. The friction has, at times, run all the way down to the troops in the battle zone. After a battlefield argument in the Zaporizhzhia region over the summer, a Russian tank commander drove his T-90 tank not at the enemy but toward a group of Russian national guard troops, firing at their checkpoint and blowing it up, said Fidar Khubaev, describing himself as Russian drone operator who witnessed the episode. \"Those types of things happen there,\" said Mr. Khubaev, adding that he fled Russia in the fall. Of all the supplementary armies charging into Ukraine, Mr. Prigozhins Wagner has become especially pivotal. Its troops have received glowing coverage on Russian state television, and in November they were profiled in a documentary film called \"Wagner: Contract with the Motherland\" produced by RT, one of the Kremlins primary propaganda outlets. \"Until recently, Wagner has been one of the most closed and secretive organizations, but for us they have made a huge exception,\" Andrey Yashchenko, the films presenter, says in the opening montage, which shows tanks rolling through rubble-strewn villages. In the first five months of the war, there was almost no public mention of Wagner or Mr. Prigozhins involvement in Ukraine. By late summer, as the Russian military began to collapse under Ukrainian campaigns in the northeast and south, Mr. Prigozhin stepped into the spotlight. After years of denying any links to Wagner and sometimes its very existence Mr. Prigozhin suddenly went public, making a show of visiting his troops in Ukraine, handing out medals, attending funerals and trumpeting his independence on the battlefield. Mr. Prigozhin attending a soldiers funeral on Sept. 23. v1.ru \"Wagner almost always fights alone,\" he said in an Oct. 14 post on the page of his catering company on VK, a Russian social media site. A Times analysis of videos in Ukraine found that Wagner troops are often showcasing some of Russias most advanced weaponry, including tanks, fighter aircraft and thermobaric rocket launchers. And because of his connection with the president, Mr. Prigozhin is given priority over other military units for arms and equipment, a senior European official said. Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied that Russias separate fighting forces were causing confusion or division, insisting they all report to Russias top military brass. The prominence of Mr. Prigozhin and Mr. Kadyrov, he said, was merely a function of their public-relations efforts. \"Some people are more active in the information space, some people are less active,\" Mr. Peskov said. \"But it doesnt signify any, lets say, independence.\" Despite its weaponry and bravado, Wagner has struggled on the battlefield. Some Ukrainian soldiers say it is a formidable foe. Yet for nearly six months, Wagners troops have been trying to seize the small industrial city of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region, and have been kept at bay by Ukrainian forces at great cost to both sides prompting a rare public acknowledgment of Ukraines fighting prowess. The frontline city of Bakhmut, where Wagner forces have fought for months. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times \"The situation is difficult but stable,\" Mr. Prigozhin said in the Oct. 14 post. \"The Ukrainians are offering dignified resistance. The legend about Ukrainians running away is just that, a legend. Ukrainians are guys with steel balls just like us. This isnt a bad thing. As Slavs, we should take pride in this.\" Hundreds of Wagner troops have been killed in the war, and several of the groups fighter jets have been downed. The convicts Mr. Prigozhin has recruited appear to be little more than cannon fodder and make up a vast majority of casualties among Wagner forces, according to an assessment by Ukraines military intelligence agency, which said in October that about 8,000 Wagner troops were fighting in Ukraine. Another former Russian inmate recruited by Mr. Prigozhin said he was left in a shallow trench at the front lines near Bakhmut for four days with no food or water and little sense of what he was supposed to be doing, other than dragging away the many bodies of his dead comrades. It was no wonder, he said, that some of Wagners recruits decided to flee. To keep control, Mr. Prigozhin has resorted to extreme punishment, showing how the war has whittled away the vestiges of rule of law in Russia. Like Mr. Putin, whose spies have been accused of poisoning and assassinating perceived traitors all over the world, Mr. Prigozhin has said that treachery is the worst sin any Russian can commit. He has proposed setting up his own Gestapo-like police force to hunt down the disloyal, including, he has said, Russian businessmen \"who leave our country in their business jets.\" The fate of Mr. Nuzhin serves as a grisly warning. Mindful of the pressures on prisoners of war and the risks they face, The Times has chosen to withhold their names. And, as with the other people we interviewed, we use documents and other evidence to vet their claims. In Mr. Nuzhins case, we did not publish our interview with him, but he also spoke to Ukrainian media, which broadcast portions of his account. Soon after, he was released in a prisoner swap and ended up back in the hands of Wagner. He then appeared in a video on a pro-Russian Telegram account. In it, Mr. Nuzhins head was taped to a block. Looming over him was a man in camouflage, holding a sledgehammer. \"I woke up in this basement, where I was told that I will be judged,\" Mr. Nuzhin says in the video, his voice dry and gravelly. The sledgehammer then swings down and crushes his skull. Shortly after, Mr. Prigozhin released a statement endorsing Mr. Nuzhins murder. \"Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed them consciously,\" the statement said. \"He planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.\" A day later, asked about the video on a conference call with journalists, Mr. Peskov said, \"Its not our business.\"",

Repeated missile and drone attacks since October, which have damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure, are part of a strategy by the Kremlin to terrorize Ukrainians and is in violation of the laws of war, according to experts.\n\nUkrainian energy operator Ukrenergo reported on Friday that more than 50% of the countrys energy capacity was lost due to Russian strikes on thermal and hydroelectric power plants and substations, activating \"emergency mode.\"\n\nCivilians shelter inside a metro station during an air raid alert in the centre of Kyiv. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The enemy is massively attacking Ukraine. Increased danger. Stay in shelters,\" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app, asking residents not to ignore the alarm.\n\nKyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions had hit the city and that three districts had been struck in the onslaught of rockets, disrupting water supplies across the capital. He suggested residents prepare a stock of drinking water while technicians work to restore the supply, and not to leave shelters as attacks continued.\n\nResidents bundled in winter coats, hats and scarves gathered in Kyivs underground stations as the sirens wailed. Huddled on escalators, their faces were lit by their phones as they scrolled through updates.\n\nOne photo shared by authorities in the Kyiv region showed the fragments of a missile in the snow, which it said the air defense system had downed. Kyiv citys military administration claimed that 37 of 40 missiles targeted at the capital were intercepted.\n\nRegional and city authorities across the country reported explosions and missile strikes hitting civilian infrastructure, and leading to some deaths.\n\nIn the central city of Kryvyi Rih, officials said a Russian missile had hit a three-story residential building, killing at least two people and that emergency services were digging through the wreckage. \"There may be people under the rubble,\" the deputy head of the presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said.\n\nA residential building damaged by a Russian missile in Kryvyi Rih. State Emergency Service of Ukraine/Reuters\n\nAt least 10 missiles struck various targets in Kharkiv region, in the north, damaging energy facilities and a hospital, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the regional military administration. Power was beginning to be restored in Kharkiv city after being knocked out for much of the day. \"There is a colossal infrastructural damage,\" Kharkivs mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said, instructing residents to use so-called \"invincibility points\" makeshift centers offering relief from power outages to collect food and hot drinks, and recharge cellphones.\n\nThe southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia was hit by more than a dozen missile strikes, according to Oleksandr Starukh, chief of the regional military administration, but it was unclear what had been targeted.\n\nMeanwhile, artillery and rocket attacks continued in the southern city of Kherson, which was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November, targeting critical infrastructure, residential buildings, medical aid and public transport, leaving four dead, according to the head of the regions military administration. Shelling also set a multi-storey apartment building ablaze, and the body of a man was found in one apartment, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-Generals Office said. The city is still struggling to restore basic services.\n\nSections of the Ukrainian railway system in Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk region were out of power following the strikes, and back-up diesel locomotives were replacing some services. Ukraines energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said that nine power-generating facitilites were damaged in Fridays attacks, and warned of more emergency blackouts.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a Ukrainian research and consulting company, said on Ukrainian TV that power outages had been rolled out prior to the strikes as a preventative measure to protect the grid from blackouts. He added that, in spite of this, the result of the attacks Friday morning would be \"unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we already see that they (Russians) are striking at the generating facilities again, trying to cut off our nuclear and thermal power plants, to damage additional key energy hubs, focusing their attacks on these facilities,\" Kharchenko said. \"I urge Ukrainians to understand that the situation is difficult, I urge them to be as prepared as possible for the fact that there will be no quick improvement in the situation with electricity.\"\n\nPolice and investigators inspect a crater at a site of an industrial area destroyed by a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv. Stinger/Reuters\n\nUkraines Armed Forces said Russia pounded the country with 76 missiles, launching cruise missiles from its fleets in the Black and Caspian Seas, and, for the first time, from Tu-95 strategic bombers at the Engels air base, on the Volga River in southern Russia.\n\nThe Engels air base, which is home to Russias long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, was targeted in a drone attack in early December, according to the Kremlin, slightly damaging two planes. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn MiG-31K, a supersonic aircraft capable of carrying a Kinzal hypersonic missile, was also seen in the sky over Belarus during the air attacks on Friday in Ukraine, according to Ukraines Armed Forces. But it was not clear from their statement whether a Kinzal was used in the attacks.\n\n\"The enemy wanted to massively disperse the attention of air defense,\" a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said. Ukraines top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhny, later said that 60 of the missiles were downed by the countrys air defense forces.\n\nLast Monday, Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraines military intelligence, claimed that Russia had nearly exhausted its arsenal of high-precision weapons, but that it still had enough supplies to inflict harm. He added that Iran has not delivered any ballistic missile to Russia analysis echoed by John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council (NSC).\n\n\"We know that their defense industrial base is being taxed,\" Kirby said of Russia. \"We know theyre having trouble keeping up with that pace. We know that hes (Russian President Vladimir Putins) having trouble replenishing specifically precision guided munitions.\"\n\nCNN is unable to verify the level of Russian missile stocks, which has previously been underestimated by Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the Patriot, the US most advanced ground-based air defense system, to Ukraine, according to two US officials and a senior administration official. Ukraines government has long requested the system to help it defend against repeated Russian missile and drone attacks. It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for members of the North Atlantic Treaty and America (NATO) in eastern Europe.\n\nIn a press briefing on Friday, the White House condemned Russias strikes targeting largely civilian infrastructure. Kirby said that the attacks showed that Moscow was \"again trying to put fear into the hearts of the Ukrainian people and to make it that much harder on them as winter is now upon them.\"\n\nHe declined to announce any details on the next security assistance package for Ukraine, but said that there \"will be another one\" and that additional air defense capabilities should be expected.\n\nThe US and NATO countries have been grappling in recent months with how to help Ukraine defend itself against relentless Russian strikes, which have, according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed about half of the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 70 countries and international organizations pledged more than $1 billion to help repair Ukraines infrastructure. Last week, the Pentagon announced that an additional $275 million in security assistance for Ukraine had been approved, including weapons, artillery rounds and equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defense. In November, the US announced a $53 million package to support repairs to Ukraines power system.\n\nThe \"first tranche\" of the energy-related equipment included in the US package has arrived in Ukraine, Kirby said Friday.",

The 67-year-old has been the target of intensive criticism from hawkish commentators, who have accused him of being too cautious.\n\nAir Force general Sergei Surovikin - who was appointed as Russia's commander in Ukraine in October - was also present at the meeting, photos released by state media showed.\n\nUkrainian forces have made a series of major advances in recent months, including retaking Kherson - the only regional capital captured by Russian forces so far.\n\nAnd the collapse of Moscow's forces in eastern Ukraine earlier this year saw military bosses come in for sustained criticism from pro-Kremlin media figures.\n\nEPA\n\nThere had been reports that Armed Forces Chief Valeriy Gerasimov (R) had been dismissed\n\nThe meeting followed claims by the commander of Ukraine's military, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, that Moscow could seek to launch a new offensive in early 2023. He warned that Russia was preparing around 200,000 troops for the attack.\n\n\"I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv,\" he added. \"I know how many combat units I have right now, how many combat units I have to create by the end of the year - and, most importantly, not to touch them in any way now. No matter how hard it is.\"\n\nHe added that the attack could originate \"in the direction of Kyiv\" and may be launched from Belarus.\n\nIn February, Russian troops advanced towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after crossing the border from Belarus.\n\nWhile the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that his forces will join in the invasion, thousands of Russian troops are currently in the country taking part in what Moscow's defence ministry called \"intensive combat training\".\n\nMr Putin will visit his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk on Monday.\n\nBut analysts have questioned Russia's ability to launch a new offensive on the Ukrainian capital, and White House spokesperson John Kirby said that US intelligence officials \"aren't seeing any indication that there's an imminent move on Kyiv\".\n\nSenior US defence officials told Reuters news agency that Russia had been forced to use decades-old ammunition with high failure rates as it burns through its supplies.\n\nThey added that \"the rate of fire that Russia has been using its artillery and rocket ammunition\" could see them run out of reliable munitions by early 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that power had been restored to nearly six million people after the latest wave of Russian strikes to hit the country's energy grid.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's metro system had restarted and the water supply had been restored.\n\nHe also posted photos on Telegram of a large Christmas tree that has been adapted to meet the constraints of a wartime winter. The tree will be lit with energy-saving bulbs run off a generator, he said.\n\nPower has also been restored in the country's second city of Kharkiv, authorities said, after it was left without electricity for hours following Friday's wave of strikes that targeted energy stations across the country.\n\nRussia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones since the wave of strikes on power infrastructure began on 10 October. International leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - have said the strikes amount to a war crime.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence says there had been an \"uptick\" in Russia's campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent days.\n\nGetty Images",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nThe Kremlin is likely attempting to depict Russian President Vladimir Putin as a competent wartime leader and to rehabilitate the image of the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) by publicizing Putins meeting with the joint headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. The Kremlin announced on December 17 that Putin worked at the joint headquarters of the services of the Russian Armed Forces throughout the day, heard reports on the progress of the \"Special Military Operation\" in Ukraine, and held a meeting with the joint headquarters and a separate meeting with commanders.[1] The Russian MoD and media published footage of the meeting with the joint headquarters that showed that Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Army General Valery Gerasimov, Russian Defense Minister Army General Sergei Shoigu, and the Commander of the Joint Group of Forces in Ukraine Army General Sergei Surovikin were in attendance.[2] Images and video of the event provided by the Russian MoD preclude the identification of other notable officers (such as military district or army commanders) present, however. The Kremlin likely publicized the meeting to present Putin as being thoroughly engaged with the planning and execution of the war in Ukraine following recent prominent criticism of his role in leading the war effort by figures in the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.[3] One prominent milblogger even questioned whether \"Putin finally showed public interest in the special military operation\" at their suggestion to do so.[4]\n\nThe Kremlin also likely publicized Putins meeting with the joint headquarters to rehabilitate the image of the Russian MoD in response to the pro-war communitys routine criticism of the Russian MoD. The Kremlin likely consciously publicized Gerasimovs, Shoigus, and Surovikins attendance at the meeting with Putin to present the Russian MoD as an organized, unified, and effective war-fighting institution and to shield the top commanders of the Russian Armed Forces from further criticism. The Russian MoD has taken great care in the past months to affirm Gerasimovs continued role as Chief of the General Staff for a similar reason- in the absence of tangible Russian victories against Ukraine, Russian military leadership seeks to present a picture of a functional and seamless chain of military command.[5] The Kremlin is likely attempting to rehabilitate the image of the Russian MoD to counterbalance the growing influence of pro-war ultra-nationalist figures, primarily that of Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner Group Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, and their parallel military structures. The Kremlin will likely continue to attempt to shield the Russian MoD from criticism while still facilitating the growing influence of these ultra-nationalist pro-war figures. This effort is unsustainable and will likely continue to generate conflict between the Russian MoD and the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.\n\nThe Kremlin likely aims to portray Putin as a leader in touch with the Russian people by publicizing Putins participation in meaningless events like the grand opening of a turkey farm. Independent Russian news outlet The Moscow Times reported that the Kremlin has instructed leaders of certain state-owned corporations and regional governors to prepare a \"positive agenda\" of news and events in which Putin can participate.[6] The Moscow Times noted that Putins calendar already includes small events, such as the grand opening of a turkey breeding center, commemorating the anniversaries of state corporations, and reopening a repaired highway.[7] The Moscow Times cited Kremlin officials who said that the social well-being of the Russian people is declining while war fatigue is growing and that Putin needs to be seen as a \"herald of good news.\"[8] Such efforts likely aim to remind the Russian people that Putin is not just a military leader in wartime but also a civilian leader with close ties to the people. However, amplifying pithy events while canceling opportunities for the public to meaningfully engage with Putin on the state of the war and the country will not likely meaningfully improve Putins image, and, as ISW previously assessed, may undermine Putins populist appeal.[9] Russian pro-war nationalists have recently criticized the Russian MoD for similar performative messaging that ignores Russias wartime realities by branding the MoD with the epithet \"Russian Ministry of Camouflage Selfies,\" as ISW has previously reported.[10]\n\nA New York Times (NYT) investigation of Russian military documents supports ISWs longstanding assessments about how flawed Russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued Russias invasion of Ukraine from its onset. ISW has long assessed that faulty Russian planning assumptions, campaign design decisions, and Russian violations of Russias own military doctrine undermined Russian operations. The NYT acquired and published logbooks, timetables, orders, and other documents of elements of the 76th Airborne Division and 1st Guards Tank Army related to the early days of the war on December 16.[11] The documents demonstrate that Russian military planners expected Russian units to be able to capture significant Ukrainian territory with little to no Ukrainian military opposition. The documents indicate that elements of the 76th Airborne Division and Eastern Military District were ordered to depart Belarus and reach Kyiv within 18 hours against little resistance; Russian planners placed OMON riot police and SOBR Russian National Guard (Rosgvardia) special police elements (essentially a Russian SWAT equivalent) within the first column of a maneuver element of the 104th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th Airborne Division.[12] Riot police are not suitable lead elements for a large maneuver force in a conventional force-on-force war because they are not trained to conduct combined arms or mechanized warfare. The decision to place riot police in the lead column is a violation of Russian (or any normal) doctrine and indicates that Russian planners did not expect significant organized Ukrainian resistance. A separate set of orders indicates that Russian planners expected unsupported elements of the Russian 26th Tank Regiment (of the 47th Tank Division, 1st Guards Tank Army) to conduct a mostly uninhibited, 24-hour dash from Ukraines border with Russia to a point across the Dnipro River, about 400 kilometers away.[13] Ukrainian forces destroyed elements of the 26th Tank Regiment in Kharkiv Oblast, hundreds of kilometers short of its intended destination on March 17.[14]\n\nThe NYT investigation also supports ISWs assessments that Russian strategic commanders have been micromanaging operational commanders' decisions on tactical matters and that Russian morale is very low. The investigation supported existing reporting that Russian soldiers in Belarus did not know they were going to attack Ukraine until February 23the day before the invasionand that some soldiers did not know about the invasion until one hour before the invasion began.[15] A retired Russian general told the NYT that the lack of a unified Russian theater command meant there was \"no unified planning of actions and command [and control].\"[16] A Ukrainian pilot told the NYT he was amazed that Russian forces did not conduct a proper air and missile campaign at the beginning of the war to target Ukrainian airfieldsas Russian doctrine prescribes. The NYT reported a Russian tank commander deliberately destroyed a Rosgvardia checkpoint in Zaporizhia Oblast over an argument and that many Russian soldiers sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid combat.[17] The NYT's findings support ISWs assessments and body of research on why the Russian military has been experiencing significant failures since the beginning of the invasion.\n\nOngoing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut are further driving a wedge between forces of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) and Yevgeny Prigozhins Wagner Group troops. DNR Head Denis Pushilin claimed on December 17 that both DNR and Wagner units are closing the \"pincers\" on Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut.[18] Several milbloggers responded to Pushilins claim and categorically denied that DNR troops have anything to do with fighting in Bakhmut, emphasizing that offensive efforts in this area are exclusively led by the Wagner Group.[19] The disparities between Pushilins claims, which represent the official DNR line, and statements made by Prigozhin and other prominent voices in the Russian information space suggest that there is a continued and growing divide between the DNR and the Wagner Group. During battles for settlements south of Bakhmut in October, Prigozhin denied any involvement by DNR or conventional Russian troops in the capture of Ivanhrad.[20] Prigozhin has also previously been remarkably clear-eyed about the slow and grinding pace of Wagner advances in the Bakhmut area, which directly contrasts with exaggerated claims made by Pushilin and other Russian sources.[21] Wagners role in operations around Bakhmut will likely continue to contribute to divides between various factions in the Russian military and discredit DNR authorities and the forces that they command.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assesses that the Kremlin is not serious about negotiations with Ukraine, agreeing with a longstanding ISW assessment. CIA Director William Burns told PBS NewsHour on December 16, \"Most conflicts end in negotiations, but that requires a seriousness on the part of the Russians in this instance that I don't think we see... it's not our assessment that the Russians are serious at this point about a real negotiation.\"[22] ISW has consistently assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in negotiating seriously with Ukraine and retains maximalist objectives for the war.[23]\n\nPutin has consistently weaponized invocations of the negotiation process to isolate Ukraine from partner support. Putin has routinely framed Ukraine as refusing concessions and likely seeks to use any ceasefire and negotiation window to allow Russian troops time to reconstitute and relaunch operations, thus depriving Ukraine of the initiative. A ceasefire agreement that occurs soon enough to allow Russian forces to rest and refit this winter is extremely unlikely. Russia and Ukraine are currently opposed to one another on the terms of any such agreement, and it is highly unlikely that Russian and Ukrainian officials will agree to a ceasefire, let alone implement one, for some months. Russian forces will likely not have the opportunity to pause Ukrainian winter counter-offensives and reset before spring.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Kremlin is likely attempting to increase perceptions of Putins competence and of that of the Russian Ministry of Defense by publicizing Putins meeting with the joint headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces and Putins appearances at non-military events.\n\nA New York Times investigation of Russian military documents from early in the war supports ISWs longstanding assessments about how flawed Russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued Russias invasion of Ukraine from its onset.\n\nOngoing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut are further driving a wedge between forces of the Donetsk Peoples Republic and Yevgeny Prigozhins Wagner Group troops.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency assesses that the Kremlin is not serious about negotiations with Ukraine, agreeing with a longstanding ISW assessment.\n\nUkrainian forces conducted counterattacks near Svatove and Kreminna and continue to strike Russian rear areas.\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations near Bakhmut and Avdiivka-Donetsk City.\n\nUkrainian officials warned that Russian forces may be attempting to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nRussia may be conducting an information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations on the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to a prospective future Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast.\n\nSeveral Russian sources denounced a military commissar's claim that Russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers. An extension of the legal mandatory service period would not be necessary to keep current conscripts in the field, however, as all former conscripts are reservists, and all reservists are already eligible for mobilization.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly continued counter-offensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line on December 17. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Sofiivka, Luhansk Oblast (21km northwest of Svatove).[24] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Ukrainian forces are advancing near Svatove and that the Svatove area is currently one of the most active sections of the front.[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Russian positions near Terny, Donetsk Oblast (17km northwest of Kreminna) and Nevske, Luhansk Oblast (18km northwest of Kreminna).[26] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces also conducted an assault in the direction of Holykove (10km north of Kreminna) in order to gain control of the R-66 highway (Svatove-Kreminna highway) and push Russian forces across the Krasna River.[27] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai reported that Ukrainian forces are also advancing near Kreminna.[28] Russian troops conducted limited counterattacks to regain lost positions near Kreminna. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna), Chervonopopivka (6km northwest of Kreminna) and Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna).[29]\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly continued to strike Russian rear areas in Luhansk Oblast on December 17. Russian and social media sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck Russian rears areas in Lantrativka (57km northeast of Svatove), Shchastia (78km southeast of Kreminna), and Kadiivka (60km southeast of Kreminna).[30]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on December 17. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian assaults on Bakhmut itself, northeast of Bakhmut near Zelenopillya (4km northeast of Bakhmut), and south of Bakhmut near Opytne (3km south of Bakhmut) and Andriivka (10km southwest of Bakhmut).[31] Geolocated footage shows Ukrainian troops shelling Russian positions northeast of Bakhmut between Soledar (10km northeast of Bakhmut) and Bakhmutske (9km northeast of Bakhmut), indicating Russian forces have advanced in this area.[32] Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov posted footage reportedly of Chechen \"Akhmat\" special forces and elements of the Luhansk Peoples Republic 2nd Army Corps firing at Ukrainian positions in Soledar.[33] A Ukrainian volunteer serviceman reported that Wagner Group forces in Opytne are being reinforced either by fresh Wagner Group troops or conventional Russian servicemen, potentially marine detachments from the Vuhledar area.[34] A Russian milblogger reported that small arms exchanges are ongoing in Opytne and that Ukrainian troops are actively counterattacking south of Bakhmut near Kurdiumivka and Ozarianivka.[35] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian counterattacks northeast and south of Bakhmut.[36] Multiple Russian sources circulated footage of Ukrainian trenches in Bakhmuts city center, suggesting that this indicates Ukrainian troops are preparing for urban combat defense.[37]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on December 17. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attacked near Marinka, Pobieda, and Novomykhailivka, all near the southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[38] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces attacked towards Vodiane, Pervomaiske, and Nevelske (all on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City) and that fighting is ongoing in the Marinka city center.[39] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian troops destroyed two Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups near Novomayorske and Shevchenko, about 50km southwest of Donetsk City.[40] The Ukrainian National Guard reported that national guardsmen successfully repelled a Russian attack near Velyka Novoselivka, about 70km southwest of Donetsk City and about 15km east of the Zaporizhia-Donetsk Oblast border.[41] Russian forces continued routine artillery fire along the line of contact in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area, in western Donetsk Oblast, and in eastern Zaporizhia Oblast.[42]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nUkrainian officials warned that Russian forces may be attempting to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that unspecified Russian elements withdrew from Kakhovka and Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast to Nyzhni Sirohozy (at the T2209 and T2208 junction 50km southeast of the east bank of the Dnipro River) and that Russian forces have been telling locals that they will fully withdraw from the Kakhovka area by the new year.[43] Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Spokesperson Natalya Humenyuk stated that Ukrainian officials are verifying this information because Russian forces could be attempting to lure Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[44] It is very unlikely that Russian forces would be able to fake a withdrawal without Ukrainian forces detecting the deception.\n\nUkrainian forces continued to strike Russian rear areas in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian strikes against Russian force concentrations in Tokmak and Polohy, Zaporizhia Oblast wounded over 100 Russian military personnel and destroyed an ammunition depot on December 15.[45] A Ukrainian source reported explosions in Zalizynyi Port (along the Black Sea coastline in southwestern Kherson Oblast, 40km south of the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River) on December 17.[46]\n\nRussian forces continued artillery, rocket, and missile strikes against areas in southern Ukraine on December 17. Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces continued to conduct rocket and artillery strikes against frontline areas in Zaporizhia Oblast west of Hulyaipole.[47] Ukrainian officials stated that Russian forces shelled Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[48] Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces shelled Kherson City and its environs on the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River.[49] Odesa Oblast Military Administration Spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk stated that Ukrainian air defenses intercepted two Russian Onyx missiles that were heading towards Odesa Oblast on December 17.[50]\n\nRussia may be conducting a new information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations regarding the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) with a prospective future Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast. A Russian milblogger claimed on December 17 that Ukraine seeks to force Russia to demilitarize the ZNPP using diplomatic means in order to reduce Russian forces ability to defend against a prospective Ukrainian counteroffensive towards Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[51] Russian milbloggers have previously misconstrued diplomatic efforts as attempts to handicap Russian forces at the ZNPP and claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron stated that both sides had reached a deal on the removal of heavy and light weapons from the ZNPP, when Macron only specified heavy weapons.[52] Such an information operation likely intends to undermine the ongoing negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish a security zone around the ZNPP as well as Ukraines status as the legitimate operator of the ZNPP.\n\nNote: ISW will report on activities in Kherson Oblast as part of the Southern Axis in this and subsequent updates. Ukraines counteroffensive in right-bank Kherson Oblast has accomplished its stated objectives, so ISW will not present a Southern Ukraine counteroffensive section until Ukrainian forces resume counteroffensives in southern Ukraine.\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nSeveral Russian sources denounced a Moscow Oblast military commissar's claim that Russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers from 12 months to 18 for spring 2023 conscripts and two years for fall 2023 conscripts on December 17.[53] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reiterated that Russian law establishes conscripts period of service as 12 months and stated that there are no proposed changes to the current law but did not directly acknowledge the origin of the claim.[54] A Russian-government-aligned Telegram channel that denounces \"fake\" news stories noted that extending the general term for Russian conscripts would require the State Duma to amend federal law and gain approval from the Russian Federation Council and President Vladimir Putin.[55] Any legal attempt to extend the general term of service for conscripts would be both extremely unpopular with Russian domestic audienceseven those who support the warbut is also unnecessary if the Kremlin desires to keep conscripts fighting beyond their mandatory service periods. Russian law designates former conscripts as reservists following their term of conscript service, and all reservists are eligible for immediate mobilization under current Russian law.\n\nThe combination of war and sanctions seems to be starting to generate considerable dislocation of the Russian labor market. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin adopted temporary measures attempting to mitigate the impact of the war and Western sanctions on the Russian labor market on December 17.[56] A prominent Russian news outlet claimed that these measures partially reimburse employers for creating temporary jobs for citizens at risk of dismissal, organize paid public work projects, and provide for vocational training for industrial enterprise employees at risk of dismissal.[57] The outlet anticipated over 176,000 Russians will use these measures in 2023.[58] ISW has previously reported major Russian labor shortages due to the mobilization of a significant portion of the Russian workforce.[59] The combination of Russian measures to address layoffs and ongoing labor shortages suggests that Russia struggles to support a balanced distribution of labor across industries, facing a shortage in some areas and a surplus in areas that now lack support capacity.\n\nRussian authorities continue efforts to use civilian donations and mandated contributions to finance the war despite common civilian financial hurdles. \"Just Russia\" Party Leader Sergei Mironov called for the Russian government to begin issuing federal war bonds at an interest rate of 2%.[60] An opposition Russian news source reported on December 16 that at least two factories of a mineral processing company in Rostov Oblast have withheld 3-5% of workers wages for \"donations\" to the war effort without worker consent since October or December.[61] Another source reported that Russian Pension Fund employees at a single Novosibirsk branch \"voluntarily\" contributed 18 million rubles (about 277,457 USD) to support military needs.[62] Novosibirsk Oblast Legislative Assembly Deputy Aleksandr Terepa announced that contributions are completely voluntary and claimed authorities have no need to mandate contributions since all workers are so eager to donate.[63] However, ISW has extensively reported on the coercion of Russian workers to \"volunteer\" for partial salary diversions in support of the war effort in addition to resident-led drives to equip Russian soldiers.[64]\n\nRussian forces continue attempts to discourage desertion through threats of punishment. An open-source intelligence aggregator posted an intercepted call on December 17 in which a Russian wife warns her soldier husband that Russian authorities gather Russian soldiers who lay down their weapons and deploy them straight to the frontlines.[65] A Russian Telegram channel reported on December 16 that the Lugacom mobile service provider continues to send customers in Luhansk Oblast messages threatening that leaving military positions is criminally punishable desertion.[66] A Russian news outlet claimed that Russian authorities in Murmansk, Veliky Novgorod, and Solnechnogorsk handed down the first three sentences under Russian articles on desertion and unauthorized abandonment of a unit during mobilization on December 16.[67] However, Russian authorities appear hesitant to punish deserters through legal channels despite creating conditions so to do. The Russian opposition news source reported that judges waived two of the three sentences and that the third sentence remains unknown.[68]\n\nWestern sources continue to confirm that Russian units that were widely considered to be elite prior to the extension of the war in February have suffered significant losses in Ukraine. The Washington Post reported on December 16 the 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (of the 14th Army Corps of the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command) sustained devastating casualties as one of the first Russian units to assault Kharkiv City in the early phases of the war and was destroyed.[69] The Washington Post noted that \"endemic corruption, strategic miscalculations,\" and \"Kremlin failure to grasp the true capabilities of its own military or those of its adversary\" turned the 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade into a weak, demoralized unit artificially inflated with inexperienced conscripts.[70] This situation resembles the depleted state of the broader Russian forces and severely limits Russian combat capability, as ISW has previously reported.[71]\n\nRussian authorities continue to struggle to monitor mobilized soldiers. A Russian opposition news source reported on December 16 that Moscow police apprehended a mobilized soldier from Nizhny Novgorod walking through the Moscow metro carrying weapons he received in October.[72] The soldier reportedly left his position due to hospitalization but kept his weapons with him afterward.[73] Another Russian source reported on December 16 that authorities discovered a mobilized soldier dead in his tent from undetermined causes at the Sergievsky Training Ground, Sverdlovsk Oblast.[74]\n\nRussian forces appear to be facing logistical hurdles in an effort to gather military equipment in Mariupol due to personnel inefficiency and incompetence. Ukrainian Mariupol Mayoral Advisor Petro Andryushchenko reported on December 17 that Russian border guards created artificial problems leading to traffic jams with a large amount of military equipment moving from Russia to Mariupol toward Zaporizhia Oblast.[75] Russian forces in Mariupol also blocked traffic for hours while unsuccessfully attempting to navigate a Buk air defense missile system under a low railway bridge.[76] Andryushchenko added that Russia forces transport dragons teeth fortifications by \"continuous caravan\" on trucks likely from Stavropol Krai, over 500km from Mariupol.[77] Russian attempts to export dragons teeth over such a great distance would represent a major logistical challenge and resource commitment to the project.[78]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian forces continue to rely on civilian labor in Russian-occupied territories to construct defensive fortifications in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian Mariupol Mayoral Advisor Petro Andryushchenko reported on December 17 that Russian forces and occupation officials have posted employment ads for civilians to construct defensive structures in Berdyansk Raion, Zaporizhia Oblast.[79] Andryushchenko reported that Russian forces previously used similar employment programs to force civilian workers from the Mariupol Ilyich Metallurgical Plant to build fortifications in Kherson Oblast in poor conditions without pay.[80] ISW has previously assessed that Russian occupation officials have mobilized residents in order to force them into constructing defensive fortifications.[81]\n\nRussian occupation officials are likely continuing to try to integrate Chechen elements into occupation administrations. A Russian milblogger posted an image on December 16 showing a propaganda billboard at the Mariupol Ilyich Metallurgical Plant that depicts Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) head Denis Pushilin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov.[82] The Donetsk Oblast occupation administrations inclusion of Kadyrov in its propaganda supports ISWs previous assessment that Russian occupation officials are likely seeking to integrate Chechen officials into their occupation structures.[83]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

In an annual address Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war has strengthened Europe's unity, and that \"no one in the West is afraid and will ever be afraid of Russia.\"\n\nZelensky also thanked Ukrainian servicemen, calling them \"heroes\" and said the powerful weapons Ukraine has received have strengthened its advantage.\n\nIf you're just now catching up, here's what you need to know:\n\nOngoing shelling. Russia struck cities including Kherson and Oleshky in the south and Kharkiv in the east. As fighting near the key Ukrainian city of Kreminna in the eastern Luhansk region continues, Russian civilians who had come to the city have stopped their work and left, according to the head of Luhansk's military administration. If the Ukrainian military is able to dislodge the Russians from Kreminna, the Ukrainian military could then proceed in two directions, the official said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have called on residents to evacuate Kherson as the city was impacted 23 times over the last 24 hours.\n\nElectricity deficit. Ukraine's power grid electricity deficit grew on Wednesday due to the shelling of gas infrastructure in eastern Ukraine, state power utility Ukrenergo said in an update. Ukraine, which has faced a wide assault on critical infrastructure and power sources since early October, will not experience further power restrictions because of the growing deficit, Ukenergo said. However, the power utility added that \"all regions were informed about consumption limits, the excess of which leads to the need for emergency outages.\" In the last three months, the power grid has suffered nine missile and 12 Russian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks, according to Ukrenergo.\n\nPaul Whelan. The White House on Wednesday renewed its commitment to getting US citizen and former Marine Paul Whelan returned from Russian detention on the four-year anniversary of his arrest. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Whelan's detention \"unacceptable\" and said that efforts to secure Pauls release will not cease until he is back home with his family where he belongs.\"",

                "cc_text": "Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, Ukraine's military said, while also exerting constant pressure along front lines in eastern regions of the country.\n\nRussia fired 33 missiles from multiple rocket launchers at civilian targets in Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in its morning report. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on Tuesday released a count of civilian casualties related to the war in Ukraine. It said 6,884 people are known to have died, including 429 children, between Feb. 24, when the invasion began, to Dec. 26. The OHCR put the number of injured at 10,947.\n\nMost of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons, it said in a statement.\n\n\"OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration,\" the statement said.\n\nHeavy fighting also persisted on Wednesday around the Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut, now largely in ruins, in the eastern province of Donetsk, and to its north, around the cities of Svatove and Kreminna in Luhansk province, where Ukrainian forces are trying to break Russian defensive lines.\n\nNationwide air raid sirens\n\nAir raid sirens also sounded across Ukraine on Wednesday morning, officials said. Ukrainian social media reports said the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Reuters was unable to immediately verify that information.\n\nBritain's defence ministry said in its latest update on the military situation in Ukraine that Russia had likely reinforced the Kreminna section of the front line as it is logistically important to Moscow and has become relatively vulnerable following recent Ukrainian advances farther west.\n\nThere is still no prospect of talks to end the war, now in its 11th month.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is vigorously pushing a 10-point peace plan that envisages Russia fully respecting Ukraine's territorial integrity and pulling out all its troops, something Moscow refuses to contemplate.\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he was open to negotiations but only on his terms, which include Ukraine accepting the loss of four regions Luhansk and Donetsk in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. Together, they comprise about a fifth of Ukraine's territory.\n\nThe Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed Zelenskyy's plan.

That he is not is a testament, first and foremost, to himself and his team, his people and his country, and then to his and Ukraines friends and allies around the world, first and foremost among them the United States and its President Joe Biden. And on December 21, the two wartime leaders finally met for the first time since Putins massive escalation beginning February 24, and met here in Washington at the White House before Zelenskys historic address to a special joint-session of Congress.\n\nRussia, on paper the second most powerful military power in the world, should have taken Kyiv and much of the rest of Ukraine rather quickly; by the odds and by the takes of most pundits at the time, Ukraine should have lost the war months ago, Ukraines military and leadership crushed (and clearly Russia hubristically expected and planned on this, too, and Putin certainly did not expect the unified and robust support of a West and NATO led by Biden). At best, it was thought Ukraine might to be able to offer some level of heroic and persistent nationalist guerilla insurgency against Russian occupiers much like the case when Ukrainian anti-Soviet partisans kept fighting from the mid-1940s into the mid-1950s in the wake of World War II and the Soviet Unions reimposition of unwanted Soviet rule over Ukraine after Hitlers German Armys temporary occupation and misrule.\n\nEven today, the official Russian \"history\" is that there were no genuine Ukrainian nationalists with good reasons to want to overthrow Soviet rule: there were only Nazi-aligned \"Banderites\" (the complicated fascist rebel Stepan Bandera was the most prominent of Ukrainian resistance leaders, hence the term). Putin, as I have noted previously, has very much doubled down on this false narrative and extended it laughably to the conflict today, in which he is constantly calling for \"denazification\" against the \"banderites\" and \"(neo-)Nazis,\" Putins term for (Jewish!) Zelensky and his government and for all Ukrainians (the vast majority) who stand against Russia and support Zelensky and the war for national liberation from Russian occupation and influence. As I have also previously discussed, much like Stalinist delusions about Finland during the Soviet Unions disastrous yet ultimately somewhat victorious war against Finland in 1939-1940, the blind assumptions about \"fascists\" in Ukraine today were deeply enmeshed in Russian war planning and are a major factor in Russias disastrous, losing performance in Russias current war.\n\nBefore Putins escalation, he and Russia were viewed as strong. Zelensky, meanwhile, had seen his initially very high popularity falter and seemed hapless to achieve any breakthroughs in the stalemate in Ukraines east with Russia and Ukrainian separatist backed by Russia. And Biden seemed headed for a \"red wave\" midterm loss and at least appeared weak on the international stage in the wake of an optically disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal (I have earlier argued that the reality of that withdrawal was more impressive that the most salient visuals, but few saw or see it that way).\n\nYet, in part because of the aforementioned and many other ridiculous mistakes on the part of Russia and at least as much in part because of the leadership of Zelensky and Biden, instead of Russias military crushing Ukraine, Ukraine has crushed Russias military. Zelensky was well-knownand sometimes dismissedas a (literal) comedian before becoming president, but it is now Putin who is viewed accurately as a belittled clown while Zelensky has become a titan of a folk hero both in Ukraine and internationally, already cementing his place in history as a far greater man than Putin. Now, it is Biden who is seen as strong on the international stage (and having helped staved off a midterms disaster domestically) and Putin who is greatly diminished, the latter losing sway among traditional Central Asian allies (former vassals), even taking disrespect to his face at international forums with their leaders.\n\nIllustration by Neil Jamieson for TIME; Source Images: Getty Images (12); Ivanchuk: Lena MuchaThe New York Times/Redux; Kondratova: Kristina PashkinaUNICEF; Kutkov: Courtesy Oleg Kutkov; Nott: Annabel MoellerDavid Nott Foundation; Payevska: Evgeniy MaloletkaAP\n\nJust this past Wednesday, Zelensky gave the most important address by a foreign leader to a joint-session of Congress since Winston Churchill came to address a joint U.S. Congress late in December, 1941, after Imperial Japans attack against the U.S. fleet in Pearl Harbor and against other U.S. bases in the Pacific. Like Churchill (and leaving aside his blatant, gross, racist imperialism, charges of any similar nature being inapplicable to the Ukrainian president), Zelensky has come to rally U.S. public and lawmaker opinion against a looming fascist threat that targets not just nations but democracy and freedom itself.\n\nWhat Has Been Going on Since My Last Major Ukraine Piece? Pretty Much What I Wrote Then, But the New Context Matters and Deserves Elaboration\n\nIt has been some time since I have put out a major analysis on the Ukraine-Russia war because there is not a whole lot of new stuff to chew on: yes, Winter is Coming (and I did put together shorter analysis noting winter will hurt the Russian military far more than the Ukrainian military, giving Ukraine another distinct advantage in the winter months), but overall, we are seeing two main phases being repeated, exhibiting dynamics that I have discussed in great detail before and that are overlapping at times to various degrees.\n\nThe inputs can be adjusteda wave of ill-trained, ill-led, and ill-equipped (and thus oft-doomed) recently-mobilized Russian troops here, additional HIMARS units or some new weapon for Ukraine (and occasionally for Russia when it comes to drones from Iran, drones that have apparently been somewhat defective) there, but the dynamics in their main essence remain unchanged. And those dynamics nearly all operatealmost mathematicallyin a significant net favor for Ukraine, and keep moving along the track of Russia losing more strength, capability, and territory while Ukraine gains more strength, capability, and territory. We can see some milestones here and there that stand out or portend certain things, but the mechanics are fairly set.\n\nSince Russias rapid collapses on three fronts outside Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy from the end of March through the first week of April, there has been a lot of repetition, but the general pattern is clear:\n\nPhase A:\n\nAfter massive, rapid victories by Ukraine, Ukraine takes time to rest, refit, redeploy, and figure out where and when and how to strike next\n\nAs this is happening, Ukraine is simultaneously using advanced Western-supplied weapons and daring raids to target Russian positions on the front lines and deep behind them to soften up the Russian positions and inflict serious casualties, which also helps to limit its own casualties as Ukraine carefully advances until an opportunity for a breakthrough presents itself (as I termed it, \"Ukrainian prudence meets Russian limitations\")\n\nConcurrent to all this, Russia keeps up ineffective, essentially suicidal assaults that make little to no progress (and often little to no sense, hello Bakhmut!) until, lo and behold\n\nPhase B: The next big breakthrough(s) for Ukraine come(s) and the cycle resets.\n\nThe major changes that occur here are that Russia significantly increases it losses in men, territory, and matriel (depleting Russian manpower, logistics bases, ammunition stocks, and Russias best weapons systems) while Ukraine gains that same territory Russia loses while receiving more advancedand new and increasingly superiorweapons systems from its Western allies, significantly increasing its capabilities over time and its overall comparative, qualitative advantages over Russia.\n\nSpecifically, the way this has played out has been for Russia to lose catastrophically on multiple fronts, first outside Kharkiv; then in Izyum, Kupiansk, and Lyman; then in Kherson. Before, during, and after these successful counterattacks, Ukraine has been able to sink the Russian Navy Black Sea Fleets flagship, the Moskva (which I seem to have been the only person to predict in an article that Ukraine would sink, just days before it happened) and conduct other attacks on the Russian Navy without even really having a navy of its own. Ukraine has even shown that it can strike major Russian bases and logistics hubs in Crimea (including the Crimean/Kerch Strait Bridge in October, which I predicted would happen all the way back in April) and other parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukraine has also demonstrated it can attack several major bases far into Russia, including, rather spectacularly, the Dyagilevo base in Ryazanjust some 100 miles from Moscowon December 5 and another base deep inside Russia, the Engels Air Base, the same day; another Ukrainian strike the following day was against Russian fuel tankers near an air field in Kursk, Russia; and the Engels base was just hit by Ukraine again yesterday even as I was writing this! All these strikes in Russian territory were carried out not with Western-supplied weapons but with some of Ukraines own Soviet-era drones that it had repurposed and upgraded: Ukraine continues to surprise and impress (there is also not unreasonable speculation that Ukraine may be behind some dramatic accidents throughout Russia, especially those concerning key utilities).\n\nConversely, Russia only continues to be predictable and unimpressive. It has been able to reinforce itself, yes, but primarily with the pathetic newly mobilized Russians, sometimes-defective Iranian-made dronesthose drones terrorizing Ukrainian civilians but having little effect on the battlefieldand, increasingly, mercenaries from Yevgeniy Prigozhins private Wagner Group (a de facto extension of the Russian military), which is increasingly recruiting desperate men from Russian (and even Central African Republic) prisons; in its military effortsnow particularly focused on BakhmutWagner is thus far failing miserably, even with rockets and missiles it has purchased recently (and embarrassingly) from North Korea.\n\nRussias Shrinking and Deteriorating Arsenal Meets Ukraines Growing and Improving Air Defenses\n\nWhich brings us to another major point: Russia may very well be running out of both its modern long-range missilesespecially its Kalibr cruise missiles and Iskander missilesand artillery rounds, forcing Russia to use degraded munitions from half-a-century ago and well-past their expiration date. In its desperation, it seems Russia is also getting artillery ammunition from pariah North Korea and is trying, thus far unsuccessfully, to get missiles from Iran (to add to Russias current humiliation, not that long ago, Iran and North Korea were under Moscows sphere of influence as a partial vassal and a supplicant client state, respectively, an indication of how low Putin has dragged Russia).\n\nFour enemies of the russian missile arsenal:\n\nbrilliant Ukrainian air defense forces; inept russian missile forces; sanctions;\n\ntime.\n\nLet's demilitarize the terrorist state to live in peace! pic.twitter.com/ndttmXCc22 Oleksii Reznikov (@oleksiireznikov) November 22, 2022\n\nTo focus more on the issue of these missiles and drones, in the face of being unable to generate any serious lasting major advances for nine months even while Ukraine has undertaken multiple major wildly successful counterattacks on multiple fronts, Russia has resorted in recent months to devoting much of its offensive operations to using these long-range missiles and drones to target civilians in major cities along with their vital power and water infrastructure in the midst of the harsh Ukrainian winter (\"offensive\" being doubly appropriate here as these attacks are clearly war crimes). Unable to properly target the Ukrainian military or defeat it on the battlefield, the inferior Russian military instead does what it can do best: target often defenseless civilians and civilian infrastructure.\n\nExcept Ukrainian cities and facilities are increasingly not defenseless. The supposedly mighty Russian Air Force has been cowed and is largely absent and not in a terribly dissimilar way to how I correctly predicted the Russian Navy would be cowed and largely absent, just with air defenses instead of anti-ship missiles, so for longer-range strikes, that is currently leaving Russia with the options of long-range attack drones (it does not have much of its own technology here, so it is getting many of them from Iran, as noted) and missiles.\n\nBut over time, the effectiveness of these Russian missile and drone attacks has been drastically decreasing: Ukraines frantic calls for more, and better, air defenses have been answered system by system, round by round, contributing country by contributing country, most recently with a pledge by the U.S. to transfer one of its premier missile defense systems, the longer-range Patriot missile system, to Ukraine and to train Ukrainians to use it (this is on top of an earlier delivery in early November of the very same missile defense systems the U.S. uses to protect Washington, DC: the highly-effective NASAMS, part of the reason for the dramatic increase in the effectiveness of Ukraines air defenses). Yet even before this recent announced addition to Ukraines air defenses, the decline in effectiveness of long-range Russian attacks has been pretty stark (a sampling below):\n\nThe October 10 first major missile and/or drone attack in these new rounds of long-range attacks involved 84 Russian cruise missiles, of which 43 were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses (over 51%), and 24 drones, of which 13 were shot down (over 54%)\n\nLets jump ahead to Russian strikes on November 15, after the delivery of the U.S. NASAMS to Kyiv: of 96 Russian missiles fired, 77 were shot down (over 80%)\n\nOn December 5, 60 out of 70 Russian missiles were intercepted (almost 86%)\n\nand 60 out of 76 on December 16 (almost 79%, lower than several previous averages, but including 37 out of 40 in the Kyiv area, or 92.5% there)\n\nand 30 of 35 Iranian Shahed drones on December 19 (almost 86%)\n\nKeep in mind: both the drones and the missiles are from finite, dwindling stockpiles, and Ukrainian air defenses are only growing in quantity and quality, with a U.S. Patriot missile battery on the way and likely more soon after, along with more air defenses from other nations. That will likely put the intercept rate for Ukraine against Russian long-range air attacks at well over 90%, making such attacks by Russia expensive and wasteful at the same time.\n\nAs I have noted before, in a military sense, the main accomplishment of Russian missile and drone strikes of the past few months has been to expose the impotence of Putin and Russia for all to see.\n\nThe Depth and Breadth of Russias Losing\n\nThats not very good or (cost-)effective for Russia, not at all, and also remember that this is one of the few cards Russia has left up its sleeve, with its best troops and equipment mostly destroyed and its navy and air force mostly sidelined. Masses of brand new and badly outfitted troops led by the same callous and careless fools who led better forces to disaster and destruction (or sometimes now led by their successors who are faring little if at all better) will not change these stark facts. These troops will be supported by and will operate inferior equipment and will have little air or naval support because of Ukrainian anti-ship and anti-air defenses. And Russia is expending its quantities of these missiles and drones against non-military targets in such a way they there will be little left to support Russian forces in Ukraine when fighting intensifies later.\n\nSo, no matter how you look at it, things are going to just keep getting worse for Russia and it will continue to sustain massive casualties and equipment losses while gaining nothing Ukraine wont be able to take back relatively quickly with improving forces and equipment.\n\nSome fools have opined that the U.S. and Europe are \"fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian.\" In reality, Ukraine is fighting Russia to the last Russian with U.S. and European help.\n\nAnd, very tellingly, there have been no major Russian advances since March, the first full month of the war. That kind of tells you everything you need to know: one month of major Russian advances, and nine months of Ukraine pounding Russian positions or pounding Russian positions while pushing them far back. The main reason why? Because Russia CANT: it simply does not have the capability to carry out large offensives that succeed, let alone then hold any new significant amounts of territory successfully from counterattacks; throughout the war, Russia has not even been able to hold much of the territory it gained since February 24. And even where Russia has held and is holding territory, there have been and are effective resistance and guerrilla movements. Between partisans, Ukrainian intelligence, and Ukraines long-range precision weapons, there is nowhere safe in Ukraine for the Russian occupiers.\n\nAll this just means Russia cannot win. And will lose (as I have argued since early March and throughout the ensuing months). Sure, it is theoretically possible Western support could be greatly diminished if, say, Trump ejects Joe Biden from the White House Grover Cleveland-style, but I doubt strongly that this will actually happen. And for the most part, Europe has not wavered even in the face of a historic energy crisis, despite Putins efforts (and Bidens leadership in holding Europe together cannot be understated here). Far more likely is that Western support will keep coming (indeed, Biden just had Congress pass an amazing nearly $45 billion in aid for Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. aid given to Ukraine since February 24 to a historic $110 billion) and Ukraine will be able to eject Russia fully from its territory (unless Russians tire of this nonsense and losing and eject the loser Putin from the Kremlin first). And it is entirely possible, I would argue even likely, that Ukraine can accomplish this before the end of 2023 (I have earlier laid out how a total Ukrainian victory would likely unfold, if you want to delve more into that topic).\n\nObviously, these are not even exchanges in terms of what each side is gaining and losing: Iranian drones with high rates of being faulty do not equal the latest new toy from the U.S. for Ukraine in the form of a Patriot missile air defense battery. And while Ukraines losses are not insignificant even if they are not known publicly with specificity, Russias losses are mind-blowing and unprecedented for any major power over any comparable period of time in the history of modern warfare over the past half-century and then some: by Ukraines estimate (which I have noted should be treated as quite credible), over 102,000 killed so far (passing the 100,000-dead milestone as of December 22), with nearly 18,000or close to one-fifth of all Russian war deaddying in those furious first five weeks of the war through late February and all of March and much of the assault on the gates to Kyiv, and well over 80,000some four-fifthsof these dying in the nearly nine-months since the beginning of April.\n\nThe losses also include:\n\nOver 3,000 tanks\n\nOver 6,000 armored personnel-carriers\n\nNearly 2,000 artillery pieces\n\n550 planes and helicopters\n\nCollectively thousands of other vehicles, drones, ships, and other pieces of equipment\n\nWhat was essentially the Russian military prior to February 24 has, in large part, been destroyed: for the near and even medium-term future, these are not recoverable losses in men and equipment, in experience and training: raw recruits cannot be thought of as replacements for elite soldiers and their units, nor decades-old tanks as replacements for Russias newest tanks. Even if Ukraines estimates end up being off, the losses for Russia are still obviously incredible.\n\nThe Current State of the War (that Russia Is Losing and Will Lose)\n\nAs my existing work already well explains the aforementioned dynamics and phases in detail, and that the current Ukrainian advances in the south and the east, though paused, will quite likely be the ones to eject Russia out of Ukraine, I have not felt a great need for some time to produce a major new analytical piece on the current situation in Ukraine. But that very absence of the need for any new sweeping analysis is telling in and of itself and merits some discussion, so that has inspired the piece you are reading now along with the requests of many a faithful reader.\n\nRight now, we are in one of those phases in which Ukraine is poking and testing Russia while defending stalwartly against costly but ineffective Russian attacks. Even though this is the less intense of the two major phases, Russia is still taking huge losses in equipment and menboth from its unproductive assaults and from precision Ukrainian strikesif not territory, but those territorial losses will be added into the mix as the other losses intensify when the next of the alternating phases opens with whatever will be the next major Ukrainian offensive or offensives.\n\nAnd if Russia is stupid enough to try to reopen a front near Kyiv, there is no chance it will fare much better now than in the opening days of the war, when Russia threw its best troops and equipment at Kyiv against far-less-well-equipped and far-less-experienced Ukrainian troops. Indeed, any Kyiv assault from Russia would either be a horribly reckless and wasteful feint or an even more horribly reckless and wasteful genuine assault.\n\nAs to the question of Belarus joining in such madness, if Belaruss hapless, buffoonish President Alexander Lukashenko is dumb enough to do anything other than bluff and host Russian forces but tries to actually invade Ukraine with Belarusian troops, he will likely see the implosion of his regime. After all, Lukashenko has had a precarious grip on power since a profound and massive protest movement erupted against him in Belarus in 2020-2021 when he stole an election from the opposition and persecuted his opposition. Unlike Putin, he is deeply unpopular in his own country and was so even before Russias invasion of Ukraine, which is also deeply unpopular with Belarusians, some even sabotaging at great personal risk Russian efforts to supply its military in Ukraine from Belarus, other Belarusianshundredseven going farther and volunteering to fight in Ukraine against Russia, which has used Belarus as a staging area for its invasion. Large swathes of both the Belarusian people and military would likely refuse to fight or rise up at the same time rather than stand by quietly or face a clearly well-trained-and-equipped and highly motivated Ukrainian military, respectively. Belarusian forces would also be facing off against far more experiences Ukrainian forces and have been able to see how badly Russian forces have fared, with thousands of wounded Russians filling Belarusian hospitals and dead Russian bodies moving into and through Belarus.\n\nBelarusian Volunteer Battalion officially joins Ukraines military.\n\nThe members of the battalion named after Kastus Kalinouski, Belarusian 19th century writer and revolutionary, took oath and became part of Ukraines Armed Forces. pic.twitter.com/XyrtX0owPn The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 26, 2022\n\nAnd it would be fairly easy for Ukraine to arm Belarusian rebels if Belarus invades (as noted, Ukraine is already arming some to fight with it against Russia), which would only be fair game at that point. And while it would be problematic for Western nations to directly arm Belarusian rebels, they can sidestep that issue if they give extra weapons to Ukraine and then Ukraine arms them.\n\nLukashenko knows all this, which is why even Putins pseudo-BFF he has staunchly resisted actually sending any of his troops into Ukraine: he knows that would likely be the death knell for his regime and possibly even his own death, and Russian forces based in Belarus could likely be easily ejected by rebel or defecting Belarusian units. All of which is very unlikely as it is, again, very unlikely Lukashenko will have his small army invade Ukraine with Russia.\n\nThus, a heavily-sanctioned Russia stands pretty much alone and losing ground, with only rogue and pariah regimes offering tepid support, and Ukraine advances backed by many of the most powerful countries in the world. Against this backdrop, the dynamics on the ground in this war have been lopsided for most of the war so far against Russia, this trend only increasing over time. It is Ukraine setting the pace and tone of the combat, and Ukraine that will choose when and where to successfully strike. Even now, it is prepping and inflicting massive casualties on the front line in places like Bakhmut, behind the front lines with HIMARS, M777s, and other precision distance weapons, and even striking deep inside Russia repeatedly just this month. Ukraines battlefield achievements grow more impressive as Russias behaviors grow more pathetic and desperate, and the writing is on the wall. Freedom-loving people around the world can be sure there will be more massive breakthroughs coming for Ukraine and Ukraine will do plenty of damage to Russia in the run-up phase, which we are seeing now. And there are no indications to seriously think that Russia will win or Ukraine will lose. In fact, Ukraine is as good at winning as Russia is good at losing, which is very, very good, indeed.\n\n2023 is going to really, really suck for Putin and Russians.\n\nSee all Brians Ukraine coverage here\n\nBrians Ukraine analysis has been praised by: Mykhailo Podolyak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; the Ukraine Territorial Defense Forces; Lt.

                "cc_text": "This contribution highlights the effects of this war in the opposite direction to what Putin was seeking, both in Ukraine - on the basis of popular mobilizations for dignity - but also in its Eurasian neighbourhood, as well as in NATO and the EU. It discusses interpretations of a NATO essentialized as hostile to Russia and of a reactive Russian war. While underlining the negative legacies to be overcome on the left on national questions in an internationalist project, the aim is to identify, from the issues raised by the war and the Ukrainian popular aspirations, axes of alterglobalist resistance in/against the EU.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine decided by Putin on 24 February has produced the opposite of all its objectives. The resistance to this aggression reveals what is happening to a Ukraine that is supposed to belong to \"one Russian people\" and to be marked since the crisis of 2013-2014 by a \"Nazi coup\" supported by the West and threatening genocide against the Russian-speaking population.\n\nI share the criticism of this thesis by left-wing Ukrainian authors who are critically independent of all imperialist and state propaganda (including Zelenskys). [1] These criticisms do not, of course, imply neglecting the importance (in Ukraine as in Russia, in France and elsewhere in the world) of extreme right-wing forces, their ideological evolution and differentiation and their relationship to institutions and violence, their means. [2] The outcome of the war will also weigh on these factors. From the point of view of the totalitarian excesses of the state apparatus, Ukraine compares very favourably with the state of the Russian Federation and its control of the oli-garchs against the \"oligarchic pluralism\" of Ukraine and its greater margins of freedom. [3]\n\nA society mobilized for its dignity - in peace and in war\n\nIt is precisely such margins, which do not exist in Russia, that have repeatedly allowed for the challenge of the autocrats in power at the ballot box and on the streets. This was the case with the \"Orange Revolution\" of 2004, which was catalysed by the rejection of corruption and electoral fraud and marked by popular hope in new, supposedly democratic parties that claimed to be \"pro-European\". Disillusionment with these parties, themselves plagued by corruption, explains the victory of Yanukovych (said to be pro-Russian) in the 2010 elections in a policy that was intended to provide balance between Russia and the EU. But the process of checking the promises made against the test of power continued in the face of the practices of the new oligarchic president, his vertical decisions, the enrichment of his family and the violence of his repressive forces. In 2014, these were the deep sources of his discredit even in his own region - hence his flight to Russia. Thus, beyond the violent and confused episodes, certainly marked by both Western support and the harsh stewarding force of the extreme right protecting the demonstrators in 2014, the fall of Yanu-kovych (ratified by the parliament) was first and foremost due to a new popular \"disengagement\", whatever its instrumentalization by various right wing forces.\n\nThe confusions of these uprisings resemble those of the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Jackets) and so many other mass movements in confused political and social contexts. The limits of this \"revolution\" are also obvious: the oligarchic regime has by no means been removed. But the label \"revolution\" expresses the accumulation of experiences that give lasting and profound force to the periodic mobilizations of a society in search of social justice.\n\nIt was the mass uprising of 2014 that was called the \"revolution of dignity\", evoking the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who organized themselves to occupy Independence Square (Maidan) while expressing multiple demands. It was also referred to less convincingly as the \"Euro-Maidan\" - which tended to misleadingly reduce the movement to a \"pro-European\" uprising. But it was assimilated, in Moscow and by part of the left, to a \"colour revolution\" (like 2004), reduced to being a pawn instrumentalized by the NATO powers. This approach (or rather ignorance) of the society can be found in the current war. Another part of the left chose to join Madan by fighting on several fronts. [4]\n\nHowever, these popular aspirations and this critical autonomy of society from the institutional parties continued to manifest themselves, after the supposed \"Nazi coup\", during the five-year term of the new president and oligarch Petro Poroshenko elected in 2014: this was shown by the lack of stabilization of the new power and its final fall in 2019. After the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of the hybrid war in the Donbas (killing some 15,000 people), the country experienced government crises and financial scandals affecting the president. He took hardly any social measures to help the thousands of people fleeing the conflicts in Donbas and was unable to overcome the impasse in the Minsk Agreements. [5] The populations autonomy of choice was again manifested, five years after the so-called Western-controlled \"coup\", by the surprise election of a Jewish actor from outside the existing political parties whose mother tongue was Russian. It was a campaign promising a peaceful resolution of the Donbas conflict and a crackdown on corruption that secured him an unprecedented landslide majority across the country (far removed from the far-right themes that Poroshenko had partly taken up). [6]\n\nThe popular mobilization against the invasion and the mobilization of the Zelensky government at its head - also unforeseen by NATO forces - consolidated Zelenskys popularity, across the political spectrum, throughout Ukraine. It was in practice a popular choice of Ukrainian sovereignty. This is especially true among the large mass of the countrys Russian-speaking eastern and southern population - supposedly saved from \"Nazi genocide\". Russian forces are far from controlling the territory of the regions annexed after pseudo-referendums and are struggling to find mayors willing to run the cities.\n\nAgainst the interpretations (and multiple quotes) according to which NATO pushes Ukraine to an endless war to bring down Russia, it is rather in the opposite direction of the pressures to temper the Ukrainian offensive that we witnessed in early November. It was the NATO staff that moderated Zelenskys denunciations attributing to Russia the strikes that killed two people in Poland. In reality, if it is true that without the arms and the obvious logistical help provided to the Ukrainian army, it would have been in a weak position and would have been forced to surrender quickly, the strength of the resistance and the victories won are - beyond the weapos - due to the determination of a population resisting an aggression experienced for what it is - neo-colonial, imperial.\n\nWhich left called on the Vietnamese to negotiate - rather than to win?\n\nWould the Left doubt the reality of resistance as a national liberation struggle if the \"military operation had been launched by France against \"French Algeria\"? The form taken by Russian colonization, and then Stalinist policy, weighs heavily. This is a fact that the feminist decolonial writer from Sri Lanka living in India Rohini Hensman points out:\n\nWhile the colonies of the Western European imperialist powers were mainly overseas, the Mongol, East European and Ottoman empires colonized adjoining countries, so it was easy to make the mistake of blurring the distinction between empire and state. While no one would think of India as part of the British state, when Putin considers Ukraine to be part of the Russian state, he is not alone, and it is not the first time he has done so. [7]\n\nBut it also highlights, as Bernard Drano does very clearly (also comparing Ukraine and Ireland) [8] disagreements dividing Marxists (and Bolsheviks) in particular on national issues. [9]\n\nIgnoring, obscuring or denigrating Ukraine as a decisive actor in both Putins aims and the resistance to his aggression is at the root of a mistaken assimilation of the current war to an inter-imperialist world war - as was the First World War. Such a presentation obviously justifies the revival of the great slogans of pacifism and revolutionary defeatism of the time and the call to turn everywhere against an \"enemy\" that is \"in ones own country\". I dissociated myself from this interpretation of the ongoing war as soon as I refused to sign the international feminist pacifist appeal [10] which - rightly - showed solidarity with Russian feminist pacifists but failed to recognize the Ukrainian feminists \"right to resist\". [11] Numerous texts (by left-wing women and men in Ukraine defending this right - and the right to protect themselves, now and in the future, including with weapons) make this debate explicit in a collection that should be read and discussed. [12]\n\nThis right to resist Russian domination obviously has globalized effects. We will come to this later. It is important to underline a specific impact, essential for the future and the outcome of this war, in the former Soviet republics that are in Russias immediate environment. This is what we will limit ourselves to mentioning here in order to draw attention to it. This will be Belarus [13] - associated with several Russian projects, including the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) - on the one hand, and Kazakhstan, which is essential to the military alliance with Russia and several other states (Collective Security Treaty Organization - CSTO) that was formed at the very beginning of 2022 following the unprecedented riots affecting this country in 2021.\n\nGeopolitical issues in Eurasia\n\nBelarus between organic union with Russia and the EEU\n\nPutins decision was not only marked by a misjudgement of Ukrainian society. It was also based on the outcome of the annexation of Crimea. While that annexation had been greeted with patriotic popular enthusiasm in Russia, it had produced quite different reactions among the autocrats of the allied post-Soviet republics. But Putin was to underestimate this factor because of recent developments in Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nFirst, it should be recalled that the annexation of Crimea broke with the 1994 Buda-pest Protocol signed by Russia with Ukraine (and similarly with Belarus and Kazakhstan) with US support: the agreement provided for Russia to recover all Soviet-era nuclear weapons but in return had to respect the borders of the newly independent states. While this annexation was popular in Russia, it was viewed with apprehension by the oligarchs of Belarus and Kazakhstan who were attached to their state sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, Putins orientation pragmatically played on several scenarios and types of unions. On the one hand, he hoped that Ukraine and Belarus would move closer to Russia to consolidate a \"Russian pole\" in the construction of a Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). This was inspired by the European Union in its shared community and separate dimensions (respecting state sovereignty). The project aimed to integrate all the ex-Soviet countries located between the Russian Federation and the EU (including in particular Georgia and Armenia, in addition to Belarus and Ukraine) - exactly the same countries that were targeted for participation in the \"Eastern Partnership\" project launched by the European Union in 2009. It was Yanukovychs hes-itation and ultimately his choice not to sign the partnership agreement with the EU that provoked the 2013 crisis. [14]\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea, President Lukashenko, who had been ruling Belarus for some 25 years, had distanced himself from Putin, moving closer to the EU to diversify his dependencies and escape sanctions. The autocrat preferred to negotiate with a Russian power weakened under Yeltsin than with a Putin who had reestablished control over his own oligarchs and had clear ambitions. But he did not hesitate to turn to the latter when his own power was threatened in 2020-2021 by the popular uprising against electoral fraud.\n\nA process of negotiation of a close union involving constitutional changes in Bela-rus then began between the two leaders: they allowed the presence of Russian mili-tary bases (even nuclear ones); but they reaffirmed the countrys neutrality and thus ruled out (for now) any direct entry into war. Lukashenko found himself obliged to specify that the country had not been \"swallowed\". [15]\n\nBut this development underlines - far from fatalistic interpretations of Russian expansionism - that these recent rapprochements have gone against the grain of the tensions visible between 2014 and 2022. It was thus a key context for understanding Putins optimism in deploying troops to Ukraines borders in Belarus in early 2022. But it was also the instability of Lukashenkos power in his own society that was re-vealed in the search for such a rapprochement at the top and at the military level. And this underlines that this is also a possible source of weakness for Putins war adventure.\n\nThe resistance encountered in Ukraine and therefore the duration and violence of the war certainly imply a more radical internal repressive course in Russia and in Belarus. But it is far from being without flaws. And these flaws are essential for the future. In the very first days of the war there were expressions of trade union solidarity against this invasion. They were quickly met (like in Russia) with radical repression, especially against the leaders of the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions of Belarus (BKDP) and the trade unions of the metal industry (SPM) and the radio electronics industry (REP). This repression has prompted trade union solidarity protests, par-ticularly from Russia (from the KTR - the Russian Confederation of Labour founded in 1995, which is itself under threat), and from Ukraine - from the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, the KVPU. [16] The Belarusian railway workers have in fact undertaken \"partisan\" actions that will surely play a key role in / against this war - to make it difficult for Russian troops to get reinforcements and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nNo nation in the world wants war. The Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian peoples are no exception. Few peoples in the world have suffered such terrible losses and sacrificed the lives of tens of millions of their citizens in their history as have our three peoples, peoples who are so close to each other. And the fact that the Russian government launched a war against Ukraine today cannot be understood, justified or forgiven. The fact that the aggressor invaded Ukraine from the territory of Belarus with the consent of the Belarusian authorities can neither be justified nor forgiven. Irreparable things have happened, and their long-term consequences on the lives of several generations will poison relations between Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. On behalf of the members of the independent trade unions of Belarus, the workers of our country, we bow to you, our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. We apologize to you for the shame, the shame that the Belarusian government has imposed on all Belarusians, by becoming an ally of the aggressor and opening the border with Ukraine. However, we would like to assure you, dear Ukrainians, that the vast majority of Belarusians, including workers, condemn the reckless actions of the current Belarusian regime in tolerating Russian aggression against Ukraine. We demand an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, as well as from Belarus. [17]\n\nThe progress of the Ukrainian resistance will have a specific direct impact on all post-Soviet societies, especially those (open to relations with Moscow but also with China and the West) with which Moscow wants to stabilize and expand the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). [18] The latter is obliged to respect the sovereignty of the states. Moscows ability to exploit the internal conflicts of each of the societies in its particular environment (such as Armenia in its conflicts with Azerbaijan) is not a matter of pure power relations. Whether it is a question of autocratic powers in post-Soviet societies or societies aspiring to more democracy and social justice, the inde-pendence of new states is a strong feature of the new post-Soviet historical phase.\n\nThe neo-colonial and brutal dimensions of the Russian intervention in Ukraine are and will be destabilizing factors and tensions in Moscows relations with its neighbours. This is true for what will happen, beyond Belarus, to the EEU but also to its military counterpart - the Collective Security Treaty Organization - CSTO. [19]\n\nCSTO - and the Kazakhstan test before and after the Russian invasion.\n\nThis military alliance includes five former Soviet republics (Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan) with Russia. It was born after the failure of previous, much larger projects. Copying NATO and aiming to either counterbalance its weight or negotiate spheres of influence, its Article 4 is the equivalent of Article 5 of the Atlantic Alliance: in case of an act of aggression against one of the member states, all the others must provide the necessary assistance, including military. But in practice, this military alliance had not intervened as such until the beginning of 2022. In 2019, it acquired a 20,000-strong rapid reaction force and a 3,600-strong peacekeeping force recognized by the UN. Opaque power struggles have become entangled with unprecedented social riots protesting against liquefied natural gas price hikes (involving multinational firms).\n\nAt the end of 2021, Kazakhstans president appealed to the CSTO by declaring a \"state of emergency\" allegedly caused by \"foreign intervention\". The return to calm was facilitated by social measures. But the CSTO forces intervened at the beginning of January 2022 and withdrew after a week. Moscow was certainly counting on taking advantage of what appears to be a success for other tasks to come in the face of global disorder and NATOs debacle in Afghanistan.\n\nIndeed, it was the fear of Taliban interventions from Afghanistan that, at the end of the CSTO operation in Kazakhstan - and thus just before the invasion of Ukraine - prompted proposals for the consolidation and extension of the interventions of this military Alliance: the Russian representative within the Alliance thus evoked the objective of \"creating a security belt not only around Afghanistan, but also around the CSTO\". [20]\n\nSuch a scenario, undoubtedly desired by Putin, would fit in well with the panorama of a recomposition of the \"spheres of influence\" negotiated on the basis of the balance of power consolidated for Moscow by the union with Belarus and the success attributed to the CSTO in Kazakhstan in the face of the NATO crisis. It can even be hypothesized that Putin expected his \"political operation\" in Ukraine to be, like the CSTO in Kazakhstan, extremely short and \"effective\".\n\nThe Ukrainian resistance to this scenario failed. Yet Kazakhstan, which plays a central role in the CSTO and its future, does not openly support what has turned into a war. And, like the Chinese ally, it does not want to burn all its cards in the relationship with the West, nor support a loser, let alone accept an even more serious breach than in 2014 of the Budapest Protocol, according to which Moscow respected the borders of new independent states by recovering their nuclear weapons. Significantly, popular protests against the war took place (without repression...) in Kazakhstan and the ruling power displayed neutrality rather than clear support for Russia. [21]\n\nIllustrating the same issue (which could raise the same concerns for Putin), the Chi-nese leader, who is supposed to be his ally, went to Kazakhstan in September. Xi Jinping even explicitly stressed on the first day of his visit to this Central Asian country that he will help Kazakhstan \"safeguard its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\" [22] - before going to Uzbekistan...\n\nThe war in Ukraine is thus profoundly affecting Russias weight in its environment, far beyond Kazakhstan, as Vicken Cheterian analyses: \"After Russias invasion of Ukraine: a wave of destabilization from the Caucasus to Central Asia\". [23]\n\nThe war in Ukraine retains its Orwellian title of \"military operation\" to minimize its real meaning and evolution. An explicit declaration of war (demanded by far-right hawks in Russia) would be dangerous for Russias internal stability (as was discovered in the recent \"limited\" mobilization); but as has been pointed out here, it would also be problematic for Russias closest allies.\n\nFrom maintaining NATO to building the EU\n\nThe fact remains that for all the currents or countries far from Russia - and often ignorant of the long history of its relations with Ukraine - this discourse against the extension of NATO to Russias doorstep and against US supremacism carries weight. This is true even when the invasion of Ukraine is denounced: it is often presented as reactive or defensive in the face of an Atlantic Alliance built against Russia and in the context of the obvious superiority of the US imperialist regime in economic and military terms. economic and military superiority. Hence a neocampism (supporting the side of any enemy of the main enemy). [24]\n\nWithout sparing Russias aggression, Tony Wood sought to highlight a \"matrix of war\" [25] based on three interacting axes, the United States, NATO and Ukraine. In his introduction, he distinguishes between the \"immediate responsibility\" of Putins Russia in this war, which he condemns, and what he calls a \"historical responsibility\" - that of NATO. But this responsibility is poorly defined. It either comes down to a \"context\" that does not explain a real war, or to pointing to the \"weapons\" (of NATO) that are fighting against Russia - omitting to underline that behind the weapons - and making them more effective than those of the Russian forces - are the choices and motivations of the Ukrainian people. Was it necessary not to resist what is well described as aggression - and if not, with what weapons?\n\nMoreover, many other grey areas and blind spots in the proposed analyses need to be discussed if we are to understand what is at stake in a situation without historical precedent. On the one hand, we have to talk about a concrete war in a concrete situation. And it is rather the open and real crisis of NATO in 2021 - and not a threat of NATO against Russia - that explains the adventurism of the war offensive launched by Putin. Added to this, and also prompting the Russian offensive, are the causes of Putins optimism mentioned above regarding the fragility of Zelensky, the union with Belarus and the success of the CSTO in Kazakhstan. There was no threat to Russia.\n\nFinally, the target and victim of this offensive - and the resistance it met - can only be understood from the neo-colonial imperial Russian content denying Ukraines right to self-determination. The shift to an offensive concretising such a relationship is permitted by the short-term context perceived as favourable by Putin, but it is based (as he himself has explained) on a legitimization that is intended to be historical by including the contestation of Lenins recognition (Putin says the \"creation\") of an independent Ukraine [26]; to this is added an \"anti-Nazi\" argument mobilizing the memory of the Second World War. Again, this is a separate issue from NATO.\n\nBut the concrete analysis of the Atlantic Alliance and its evolution must also be clarified. Putin, like everyone else, knew that its dominant members would not vote for Ukraines membership - precisely in order to protect shared interests with Putin. This point is not a detail. Its omission is part of an outdated and essentialized vision of an anti-Russian NATO that merges and obscures several opaque contexts that can only be briefly mentioned here. On the one hand, Russia is not the USSR (the axis of \"communist\" evil), nor its continuity. And it was the Russian Federation, headed by Yeltsin, which was a key player (along with representatives of Ukraine and Belarus) in the dissolution of the Union combined with the capitalist dismantling of its system welcomed with open arms by the US and the IMF. This was not an external aggression but a choice where historical shifts of an essential part of the former communist nomenklatura were weighing. The scenarios of insertion into capitalist globalization were not the same for the opaque German unification [27], Yeltsins Russia or China - nor for the different countries of the former USSR or Eastern Europe. [28] The new Russian Federation was supported with open arms by the US - including its dirty wars against Chechnya, among others the one led by Putin as part of the ideology of partnership with NATO and its new \"wars of civilizations\" against Islamic terrorism replacing communism.\n\nIndeed, (new) Russia was not the target of NATOs continuation in 1991 and then of the first shifts in its functions (with NATOs first offensive war over Kosovo in 1999). In these two contexts, it is more credible to underline what was Washingtons main concerns: German unification and the (simultaneous) construction of a new European Union incorporating this unified Germany. [29] This was an unforeseen event catalysed by the decision to unify the currency after the fall of the Berlin Wall - a historic fall, without repression on the part of the GDR, because it was supported by Gorbachev who came to negotiate credits with Federal Germany. The USSR leader hoped to build a \"Common European House\" - not without a sympathetic ear from Mitterrand. And while the US (and the UK) wanted to control a unified Germany by incorporating it into NATO, France was negotiating with the new Germany to put an end to the DM and build a new European Union (EU).\n\nAnd it was against this EUs desire for political autonomy and its expansion into Eastern Europe that the United States used NATO operations for its own interests. The Alliance was on the verge of collapse during the first \"strikes\" against Slobodan Milosevics Yugoslavia. [30] The scenario of the three-month war in Kosovo is very different from that in Ukraine. NATOs offensive intervention (without a UN mandate) was supposed to be limited to a few \"strike\". And to avoid the break-up of the Alliance and the worst fiasco, it was necessary to quickly insert the UN Security Council (and thus Russia) into the process of negotiating the end of the war. Its Resolution 1244 - regularly claimed by Milosevic (but not by the Kosovo Albanians) - set up a deeply unstable and corrupt provisional international protectorate.\n\nIt was possible to support the Kosovo Albanians right to self-determination - against the dominance Milosevic wanted to impose - while at the same time radically criticizing the continuation and impasses of the new functions the US was assigning to NATO [31], accompanied by fake news to legitimize them. [32] None of this was a threat to Russia. The provisional choices of alliance of a part of the Kosovo Albanians (the KLA) with the US and NATO did not question the deep root of the (historical and recent concrete) conflict with Belgrade - and thus the issue of self-determination of the Kosovo Albanians. This was expressed in evolving contexts, until the countrys parliament proclaimed independence in 2008 - which to this day has still not been recognized by Belgrade or (therefore) by part of the UN and the EU.\n\nAs in Ukraine, the people of Kosovo have judged the countrys deep corruption and economic disaster, irrespective of global geopolitical issues. And in 2021 an unprecedented mass popular vote in this former province of Serbia marginalized the \"historic\" parties allied with the US by switching to the young left-wing party, \"Self-Determination\": it campaigned on the basis of a radical critique of corruption and in defence of a substantive social agenda - while turning its hopes towards the EU. [33]\n\nUkraine has also applied for membership. How should the (EU-critical) left deal with such a request?\n\nWhat axes of alterglobalist solidarity?\n\nUkraines application for EU membership, the militarization of budgets associated with NATO and the challenges of ecological transition associated with war are the three \"dossiers\" that should be opened and managed urgently, but in a sustainable way, on a European scale and beyond, from an alterglobalist perspective. The magnitude of the combined crises that war aggravates with globalized effects affecting first and foremost the poorest populations requires responses on the same scale. We must face the reality of the divergences and the complexity of the conflicting issues in these various dossiers in a deliberately pluralist perspective in order to try to broaden our horizons (and the different perceptions of the issues according to the regions, countries from which we speak, lived histories), the necessarily unequal knowledge of a complex past and present, in order to bring together the criteria for judgement and the priority objectives - by striving to identify what makes it possible to act in common.\n\nI believe that it is possible and necessary to integrate the three issues mentioned above into a general approach in/against the EU - which could find its place in the revitalization of a public and activist space for European debates as the Altersummit could have been.\n\nDecolonizing approaches to Europe\n\nFirst of all, there should be an awareness of the evils of ignoring a whole \"continent\" - Eastern Europe, in the broad sense, towards Eurasia. The decolonization of analyses and responses involves a semantic struggle. It involves systematically rejecting the assimilation of the EU to \"Europe\" - just as the United States has proclaimed itself \"America\". To the extent that it was proposed to Eastern Europeans to \"join Europe\" and that early radio commentary on the war in Ukraine placed it \"at the gates of Europe\". There are several dimensions to this vocabulary: how can one criticize Europe? Unless one becomes a \"nationalist\"? This was the stigma and choice gen-erally associated with the political upheavals in Eastern Europe. Joining \"Europe\" could only be evidence of progress and civilization compared to \"non-Europe\" (Eastern, or Communist, or Balkan...). I criticized such a vocabulary in the frame-work of the 2012 Zagreb Subversive Forum where Attac intervened, reversing the necessary light from the \"Balkanized\" periphery to criticize the \"civilizing\" practices and vocabulary of the EU towards the Balkans and Eastern Europe: \"The Balkan Social Forum: a chance for another Europe\". [34]\n\nIt is our responsibility - to be shared with our colleagues and comrades in these countries - to take stock of the conditions under which these countries have been exploited (in the context of the dismantling of their system and the dictatorship of the single party), by radical social and fiscal dumping supposed to \"modernize\" and democratize them. [35]\n\nThe fact that such apologetic vocabulary is used by Volodymyr Zelensky in his speeches in the European Parliament does not help to convince those leftists who already tend to ignore Ukraine in their approach to the war. But in this regard, we must distinguish between two aspects: the denunciation of Russias neo-colonial war and the recognition of the right of self-defence of the aggressed country does not depend on the nature of the leadership of that country (and does not require an \"ideal\" country); but we are obviously politically free to decide how we express our solidarity.\n\nFrom this point of view I subscribe and propose to join the European Network of Solidarity with Ukraine [36] which has the following platform:\n\nWe, collectives of social movements, trade unions, organizations and parties, from Eastern and Western Europe, opposed (...) to war and to all neo-colonialism in the world, want to build a network from below, independent of any government FOR :\n\n1/ The defence of an independent and democratic Ukraine!\n\n2. The immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from all Ukrainian territory. The end of the nuclear threat posed by the alerting of Russian nuclear weap-ons and the bombing of Ukrainian power plants!\n\n3. Support for the resistance (armed and unarmed) of the Ukrainian people in its diversity, in defence of its right to self-determination.\n\n4. The cancellation of Ukraines foreign debt!\n\n5. The reception without discrimination of all refugees from Ukraine and else-where!\n\n6. Support for the anti-war and democratic movement in Russia and the guar-antee of political refugee status for opponents of Putin and for Russian sol-diers who desert!\n\n7. Seizure of the assets of Russian government members, senior officials and oligarchs in Europe and around the world; and enforcement of financial and economic sanctions by protecting the disadvantaged from their effects.\n\nBeyond this, we also fight, in conjunction with like-minded currents in Ukraine and Russia:\n\n1. For global nuclear disarmament. Against military escalation and the milita-rization of minds.\n\n2. For the dismantling of military blocs.\n\n3. For any aid to Ukraine to be free from the grip and austerity conditions of the IMF or the EU.\n\n4. Against productivism, militarism and imperialist competition for power and profit that destroy our environment and our social and democratic rights.\n\nAs the beginning of the platform indicates, the network organically integrates (in its meetings, campaigns, debates) components (associations, trade unionists, parties) from Eastern Europe. In practice, priority has been given to links with the socialist NGO Sotsialnyi Rukh [37], trade unionists from Belarus, and components of the Russian left (with campaigns in solidarity with those who oppose or flee the war in Russia). This means that the struggle against the war is combined with several campaigns that can be joined: the demand for the cancellation of the Ukrainian debt that spares the oligarchs and allows the IMF to exert pressure for the dismantling of public ser-vices and the increase of energy tariffs; but also trade union campaigns against the laws that have been proposed and finally adopted, exploiting the context of war to dismantle social rights. Also on the site is the radically critical analysis of the \"reconstruction of Ukraine\" project prepared in the Lugano conference in July 2022, which is geared towards a socially and ecologically disastrous exploitation of Ukraine subordinated to the logic of profit. [38]\n\n\"Should the European left support Ukraines application for EU membership?\" asks a text by an activist from Sotsialnyi Rukh (SR). [39] She answers positively - including from the collective point of view of her organization - to this question. Not without a lucid analysis of what the EU is - and what its effect has been in its eastern and southern peripheries. She writes on this subject: She answers positively - including from the collective point of view of her organization - to this question. Not without a lucid analysis of what the EU is - and what its effect has been in its eastern and southern peripheries. She writes on this subject:\n\nWe can learn from the experience of other countries in Eastern and Southern Europe. Poland, Slovakia and other EU countries have experienced liberaliza-tion in various areas, directly encouraged or tolerated by the EU. In many Eastern European countries, the share of fixed-term contracts increased in the 2000s, while permanent contracts became rarer. At the same time, reforms were implemented to make it easier to dismiss workers, for example, with the argument that this would lead to the creation of new jobs. These developments occurred, albeit unevenly, in all Eastern European countries and were accel-erated by crises such as the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a deepening of neoliberal policies in the EU and globally. It is also worth mentioning the role of the European Central Bank in promoting fiscal conservatism and its conse-quences on the welfare of the population, which we have seen in the example of Greece.\n\nSo why support EU membership?\n\nThe question is actually outdated, but interesting to discuss. Outdated because the official application for membership was submitted, and four months later - last June - the 27 accepted Ukraine and Moldova as official candidates. But the question remains interesting because \"candidate\" status does not imply actual membership. It opens a long negotiation process - from which some of the Balkan countries have still not emerged for years: from the former Yugoslavia, only Slovenia and Croatia have been integrated. All the other republics are waiting for the process to be com-pleted (and it is partly on the back burner for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo). Representatives from the Western Balkans would find it difficult to accept that Ukraine would be integrated more quickly than them.\n\nSo the real question is the terms of integration - what is being \"negotiated\"? And does the left have any solidarity campaigns to run on this front. What does our Ukrainian comrade say about this?\n\nOn the one hand she points out that it is possible to exploit the solidarity expressed towards Ukraine in the face of war to forcefully legitimize specific conditions granted to the country:\n\nThe EU should admit Ukraine under conditions that guarantee the possibility of a social and egalitarian reconstruction and not create obstacles to it (...) European competition law and the radical restriction of protectionist policies create significant obstacles to a social and progressive reconstruction of Ukraine. Exceptions to these laws should therefore be made for Ukraine. This would not be the first case of this kind. Countries like Denmark have even joined the Union with special conditions that have created exceptions to other laws.\n\nShe furthermore points out that neo-liberal policies have been promoted in Ukraine without EU membership - and in particular within the framework of the \"Eastern Partnership\". Membership would at least confer rights and would not be worse than absolute peripheralization without rights.\n\nMoreover, she says, for the Ukrainian people\n\nEU membership is of great symbolic importance - it has been the main goal of the countrys foreign policy since 2014. Opposing it would be very unpopular and would require clear equivalent alternatives that do not currently exist.\n\nShe believes that European rights are in some areas more progressive than Ukraines, and therefore that EU integration favours the fight for social advances. Most importantly:\n\nintegration can facilitate the networking of local organizations like Sotsialnyi Rukh with other left-wing actors and lead to the development of long-term re-lationships - which, in turn, can ensure that attention to the problems in Ukraine does not remain tied to the events of the crisis.\n\nIn fact this is what the European left should be building - European links with the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkans for campaigns for common rights and goals. And for an overhaul of the terms of membership. In doing so, what is needed is a questioning of the existing treaties, their ongoing modifications (without a constituent process) and the policies implemented in the face of the major intertwined crises: environmental, financial (since 2008 - what transformations and banking fra-gilities) and political (effects of the ongoing war).\n\nAid to Ukraine does not imply the militarization of budgets: for the submission of the budgetary and military policies of each country to the control of the society.\n\nIt is essential to be able to defend a policy of solidarity with the (armed and unarmed) resistance of Ukraine against a murderous neo-colonial aggression, and to keep an independent and critical judgement on the policies of our governments. I have explicitly quoted the platform of the European Solidarity Network Ukraine (ENSU). I repeat its last points:\n\n1. For global nuclear disarmament.\n\n2. Against military escalation and the militarization of minds. For the disman-tling of military blocs\n\n3. For any aid to Ukraine to be free from the grip and austerity conditions of the IMF or the EU.\n\n4. Against productivism, militarism and imperialist competition for power and profit that destroy our environment and our social and democratic rights.\n\nBut the way to fight for these goals requires breaking down a \"globalizing\" and essentialist approach to NATO and aid and distinguishing between several issues that should be debated in order to develop a globalized platform \"for a just and lasting peace\":\n\nNATO should have been dissolved with the Warsaw Pact in 1991. Its continuation and the evolution of its functions (from a defensive alliance to an offensive alliance and intervening anywhere) have been neither transparent nor democratic processes. The assessment of its interventions should be made in each country involved. But the same goes for all military pacts: we must oppose the logic of sharing spheres of influence based on permanent pacts that poorly disguise relation-ships of domination.\n\nAll armies should be returned to their home territory and placed under the control of the countries concerned. This would open up a concrete process of demilitarization - and the case-by-case judgement of military aid for causes deemed just. Within this framework, the armed forces of a country can also be involved by international agreement in peacekeeping action outside their territory - under the control of the UN or the countries concerned.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was launched by Russia. Aid to Ukraine does not turn the war into an inter-imperialist war. Defence aid to Ukraine is legitimate and should remain under the control of the Ukrainian people and their choice of negotiating conditions.\n\nEvery population in every country should be able to control what budgets are actually allocated to Ukraine and other goals and conflicts: a progressive global anti-war movement cannot equate a dominant countrys war of aggression with an aggressed countrys defensive war. A just struggle - with arms in hand against armed aggression - must be defended, even if one also recognizes conscientious objection and the possible choice of non-violent resistance. but this choice belongs to the people and peoples under attack.\n\nThe reconstitution of an autocratic state and regime in Russia with military and imperial interventionist dimensions poses obvious security problems for the countries close to Russia and the populations of the federation likely to revolt against relations of domination. This was the case in Chechnya. The fact that the countries concerned perceive (rightly or wrongly) NATO as a protective framework makes it impossible for the left to mobilize for the dissolution of NATO as long as this threatening situation from Russia continues. But this does not mean that there is no need to criticize NATOs plans and the expansion of its budgets.\n\nFrom sanctions against the Putin regime to European environmental policies.\n\nThe climate emergency and solidarity against this war should be combined with our criticism of the EU: the Putin regime feeds its aggressive policies on the income from fossil fuels. Sanctions on Russian imports must at the same time accelerate the process of energy transition - and thus obviously reject the increase of fossil fuel production elsewhere, and in particular the deployment of liquefied natural gas production and distribution.\n\nAt the same time, this policy requires the protection of social rights and jobs - implying a vast pan-European project of planning reconversions and investments in re-newable energies. This could be addressed to the populations of all European countries - including Russia, on condition that the war stops.\n\nUtopia? Lets turn it into a \"real utopia\" - and \"if they wont let us dream, lets make sure they dont sleep\"...\n\nThe initial version of this article was written in French for the on-line [Revue Les Possibles-> https://france.attac.org/IMG/pdf/samary-possibles_34.pdf, Attac, winter 2022.",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Her husband, Anatoly Klimashenko, pointed to where the shells exploded: one near the cabbage patch; another where the strawberries grew; yet another on the garage he built.\n\nLyman was the site of fierce fighting in May, when Russian forces seized the city, and in the summer. The Russians occupied Lyman until Oct. 1, when they fled a fast-advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nBut even amid the wreckage of their home with the walls blown out and wood planks hanging from the ceiling the Klimashenkos said they feared an even worse fate: another Russian invasion, potentially their third in eight years, as President Vladimir Putins self-assigned \"main goal\" of \"liberating all of Donbas\" yet again puts their city in the Kremlins crosshairs.\n\n\"Theyre going to bring more destruction,\" said Anatoly, 62. \"And already there is nothing left to destroy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many others here, the Klimashenkos for about six months have slept in an underground storage unit to avoid the shelling, and now subsist on humanitarian assistance brought by Western aid groups.\n\nPutins insistence that the war will continue until his objectives are met means that the fight for Lyman or whats left of it isnt over. The Russian president has doubled down on his illegal annexation claims in recent days, insisting that people like the Klimashenkos and their neighbors are now Russian citizens, who must be liberated from the Ukrainians who liberated them from the Russians in September.\n\nThis destructive, and seemingly pointless, cycle of conquest and liberation has been underway for nearly nine years ever since the Kremlin began fomenting a separatist war with false claims that Russian-speaking Ukrainians were under threat from the pro-Western, pro-democracy protesters who rose up in fury after President Viktor Yanukovych, under pressure from Putin, broke a promise to sign expansive political and economic agreements with the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLyman and many small cities, towns and villages nearby now lie in ruins.\n\nDetail Kyiv Russian-controlled area UKRAINE RUSSIA KHARKIV 20 MILES Russian-held areas Kupyansk LUHANSK Ukrainian-held areas Svatove Starobilsk Donets R.

Years of war have both left the area a wasteland and also hardened its people against the Kremlin, making a mockery of Russian claims that their forces would be welcomed with open arms.\n\nPutin falsely accuses Kyiv and its Western supporters of carrying out a genocide in Donbas, the wider territory that encompasses the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukraines Western supporters have imposed unprecedented sanctions aiming to punish Russia for invading and trying to annex Donbas, along with the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, in violation of international law.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged to reclaim all of the occupied lands. But an equally likely fate for these fought-over territories is the devastation visible in and around Lyman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarisa, 62, of Lyman, recalled counting as many as 200 shells exploding per day when she and nine neighbors were trapped in a basement between Russian and Ukrainian lines for five weeks in the early fall, in a suburban part of the city that used to be part of a resort destination.\n\nAfter Russias illegal annexation of provinces in the eastern Donbas region, Russian troops withdrew from Lyman, leaving a path of death and destruction. (Video: Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post)\n\nOne shell directly struck the kindly 70-year-old amateur beekeeper across the street, nicknamed Mikhalych, as he went to feed the stray dogs in the neighborhood. His body lay in the street, giving off a stench that his neighbors could do nothing about for five days because of the bombardment.\n\n\"Its hell, Armageddon, and weve already lived through it,\" said Larisa, who asked to be identified by her first name for fear of reprisal. As she spoke, she stepped around shattered glass, a childs pair of goggles and a discarded Coca-Cola bottle. \"Is this being liberated?\"\n\nBefore she found her sons body six days after his death, and before shrapnel shattered her walls and forced her to live for seven months in a basement, Tamara Kovalenko, 65, said she did not care much if her city was controlled by Russia or Ukraine but thats no longer the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ive changed my views completely,\" Kovalenko said, as she picked up a bag of donated food from a United Nations distribution point in the center of town. \"In 2014, I didnt hate the Russians.\" With her aid package, Kovalenko returned to a home with no electricity, heat or running water.\n\nArtillery shells exploded in the distance roughly every 30 seconds, and machine gun fire erupted every few minutes from the front lines about six miles away. \"Now, we are so afraid of them coming back that we try not to think about it, not to even imagine it,\" she said. \"We are just terrified.\"\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAfter Russian proxies seized control of parts of Donbas in 2014, the pro-Kremlin authorities banned the Ukrainian language from being taught in schools and introduced the ruble as the official currency, according to Sergei Anatolyevich Garmash, a journalist and Ukrainian politician who was part of the failed negotiations to implement the Minsk II peace accords, a 2015 cease-fire agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCombining the gains after 2014 with this years invasion, the Kremlin has taken control of roughly 75 percent of the Donbas region, according to Paul DAnieri, a professor who studies Eastern European politics at the University of California at Riverside.\n\nCapturing the city of Bakhmut, where heavy fighting is now taking place, would give Russia yet another foothold in its push to seize of all of Donbas, DAnieri said.\n\nAnd yet, many experts say, Putins repeated attempts to seize the territory have led to a surge in pro-Ukrainian sentiment. Studies conducted in 2014 and 2022 found that the region grew significantly more pro-Ukrainian in the aftermath of Putins invasions, DAnieri said.\n\nEven many who might have been inclined to welcome Russian troops now seem too exhausted to care.\n\nSince shelling destroyed the staircase to her apartment nine months ago, Lubov Gazhla, 62, has lived in a sordid storage closet underground, down a narrow maze of rusted pipes and exposed brick. A critic of the Ukrainian and Western governments, she expressed pride in her Russian roots and serenaded reporters with part of the epic poem \"Ruslan and Ludmila,\" by the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Gazhla said that above all else she wants the fighting to stop.\n\n\"I dont care if were ruled by the Africans at this point,\" Gazhla said, showing reporters the small tin can she has used to go to the bathroom for the past nine months. \"Who can live like this?\"\n\nIn a ceremony at the Kremlin on Tuesday, Putin presented awards to the new governors appointed to lead the four regions of Ukraine he has claimed, illegally, to have annexed, including Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nBut in some parts of Donbas, there is almost nobody for them to govern.\n\nSeveral towns in Donbas with a few thousand people Toshkivka, Novotoshkivske, Bilohorivka, Makiivka have been entirely or almost entirely depopulated, according to Serhiy Haidai, the exiled governor of Luhansk, which is now almost entirely under Russian control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other cities in Donbas, where the population has been halved or reduced even further, the critical infrastructure is decimated. Across the region, almost every school has been destroyed by shelling, according to Haidai. The gas pipes in most cities are also \"completely destroyed.\"\n\nIn the city of Kreminna, close to the front lines, the water systems are demolished. In parts of Luhansk, residents of bombed-out buildings gather logs to heat their homes and shower in tents using outdoor buckets, Haidai said.\n\nIn Donetsk, Bakhmut has been annihilated by months of grueling warfare.\n\nMany of the people remaining in the western cities of Donbas say life has improved a bit since Russians were forced to fall back in September and October. Western aid has begun arriving daily, providing a baseline of food and medical supplies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepairs have started on a handful of shattered roofs. In Yampil, the Bon Appetite convenience store reopened two weeks ago the only open store in town after being closed throughout the occupation.\n\nBut progress has been slow, and scars from Putins invasion remain ever-present.\n\nIn Lyman, Zoya Konstantinovna, 67, cried into a cloth as she described how missile fire tore into her former home, before showing reporters the sealed sack of water that she uses daily as her shower even now, more than three months after Ukrainian forces retook the city.\n\nRoughly two dozen of the hundreds of people who once lived in her apartment complex now spend most of their days in the below-ground bunker, with the shelling still too present a danger to sleep elsewhere.\n\n\"We are like rats who live underground,\" Konstantinovna said. \"Politics all that is very far from us. All I want is peace and health. We just want to not live like this anymore.\"\n\nHaving already lived through two occupations, Victoria Svichinskaya said she goes home every night and listens to news from the front lines until her phone dies.\n\nRussian soldiers turned her home into a military barracks for five months when Lyman was occupied. They looted her stove, ripped out a toilet seat and demolished a section of her home.\n\nFormerly the owner of two clothing stores since destroyed by the invasion, she stood recently at an open-air market across from two homes ruined by shelling, trying to sell a few dozen cans of Hell Energy, a soft drink, and sealed cases of kielbasa.",

                "cc_text": "The withdrawal of the Russian army from Kherson has given Ukraine a morale boost as the first year of the war is nearing its end.\n\nIn response to its military defeats, Russia has resorted to attacking the civilian infrastructure. The wanton destruction of power plants and power lines all over Ukraine leaves millions of people in the dark, without heating and running water. In many cities, electricity and hot water are being rationed and this is only the beginning of a long winter of war.\n\nOver time, cold can wear down the body and affect the mind. Throughout history, the mood on the home front has proven decisive for many wars, including World War I. Russia lost the war in 1917 also because of civilian protests, and Germany eventually had to ask for an armistice because of the domestic situation. The mood on the home front is the second dimension of the current war, and it is just as important as the military developments that Ukrainian and western media cover so extensively.\n\nAnd then there is also a third dimension to this war: the economy. Here, the West is directly involved. For although it has never been formally declared, western sanctions on Russia add up to an economic war.\n\nThese three dimensions are interconnected. Yet, to draw a balance from the first year of war, we need to look at each of them separately.\n\nThere is no Ukraine war\n\nWestern media mostly use the term War in Ukraine (or German media Ukraine-Krieg), which is just as misleading as Ukraine conflict. In terms of contemporary history, this war did not begin on 24 February, but as far back as 2014, when Putin used the turmoil following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity to annex Crimea and invade the Donbas. From the very beginning, this was a Russian-Ukrainian conflict and a Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nThis conceptual clarity matters so much because it signifies that the primary problem is not Ukraine, but Russia. The misnaming of conflicts has often had fatal consequences for example, when the European public lamented minority problems in the mid-20th century instead of naming the real core of the problem: the idea of unitary nation states. This intellectual blunder contributed to the mistreatment and extermination of these very minorities let this be a grim reminder of the weight of their words to all academics, policymakers and journalists who still use the term Ukraine war.\n\nThe first Russian-Ukrainian war began in 2014 and never fully ended. More than 15,000 people died along the ceasefire line in the Donbas since then. Putin used the unresolved territorial conflict as a bargaining chip to block Ukraines accession to NATO.\n\nIn principle, the defensive alliance cannot accept a new member that is in a state of war because of the obligation to provide assistance. Moreover, the war has deterred investors and has weakened Ukraine economically over the years. Although the Russian strategy was quite obvious, the western sanctions against Russia were half-hearted. Moreover, they were openly undermined by Germany through Nord Stream 2, most of which was constructed after Russias 2014 aggression.\n\nThe first Russian-Ukrainian war transitioned almost seamlessly into the second Russian-Ukrainian war in February 2022. However, this war represents a new development on all three levels in terms of the military conflict, the economic impact and the mood on the home fronts.\n\nBack to the battlefields of Europe\n\nFirst, the military level: the Ukrainian army and civil society put up strong resistance starting right on 24 February, and have been able to repel the attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the North, Mikolayiv and Odessa in the South, and in the Donbas.\n\nNeither Putin nor western intelligence services had foreseen such a strong resistance. As early as March, the Russian dictator failed in the first of his war aims: he didnt manage to occupy a large part of Ukraine nor to overthrow its democratically elected president, let alone install a quisling regime.\n\nThe second set of objectives, the conquest of eastern and southern Ukraine, called New Russia in Putins propaganda, failed along with the great offensive in the Donbas. There, the Ukrainian army turned the tables in the summer and liberated the entire Kharkiv region. In November, the Russian army had to retreat southwards from the left bank of the Dnipro river, and abandoned Kherson, the only regional capital it had conquered in the first year of its second war against Ukraine.\n\nDespite all these setbacks, Russia still seized one minimal war objective: the land bridge to Crimea. Since November, it looks like the Russian army is digging in along the previous front lines in the South. This could create a situation similar to that of the Donbas in the preceding years. Russia could live with that, but not Ukraine, being economically and demographically weakened and kept under pressure by a sustained occupation and permanent threat of further aggression.\n\nWhile the Russian army has been surprisingly weak, Russia has fared much better in the economic war. This dimension of the war has much wider ramifications, because there the West is directly involved. Russia sees the entire EU, including Germany, as belligerents in the economic war. In the longer term, the sanctions will severely damage the Russian economy, but two factors have limited their impact from the start. The two most populous countries in the world, China and India, did not join the sanctions. NATO member Turkey, and Hungary, Putins Trojan horse within the EU, are also undermining them.\n\nIt was predictable that Russian countermeasures would hit Germany and the eastern EU states particularly hard. Industries with high energy consumption are already facing major problems. There is a threat of an exodus of production, and even the risk of de-industrialization.\n\nSpecial operation and economic war\n\nBut there is no way back from the economic war. The West faces a similar dilemma as Russia. Moscows special operation against Ukraine was never really explained to the Russian population. The same goes for the economic war the West wages. Had this war been publicly declared, the EU would have had to boycott Russian gas and oil on its own initiative. So far, however, the sanctions have been justified primarily on moral grounds the invasion is a violation of international law, and the genocidal war crimes committed by the Russian army are a decisive piece on the scale.\n\nBut a purely normative policy always stands on weak legs, even if the condemnation of Russias actions is unanimous. A small advantage amid great adversity is that the energy price crisis it is too soon to speak of an energy crisis is offering an opportunity to fast-track a long overdue green transformation that so far has been caught up in the reluctance of European governments, fearing for the momentary performance of their economies.\n\nBut however necessary this transformation is, the European economies and civil populations pay a price even if it pales in comparison with the Ukrainians sacrifice. The recession is increasing pressure on the western home fronts, while Russia is benefiting from higher energy prices.\n\nRussian resilience\n\nEurope is made up of many countries, and thus many home fronts. If individual countries start breaking their sanction pledges, there is a risk of a domino effect. This is exactly what Putin is counting on.\n\nAnd thats exactly why we cannot count on a quick end to this military conflict. The war has so far been fought almost exclusively on Ukrainian soil, which means that the Russian civilian population can, in principle, continue to live as they did before 24 February. So far the main tolls are the rising number of casualties and the unpopular mobilization of the military, but that can be clouded in the propaganda of a second great patriotic war.\n\nRussian society also has certain advantages in facing a second winter of war next year, because it has experience in dealing with shortages. Due to the socialist scarcity economy and the depression in the 1990s, the population had to acquire survival techniques that are only known in much of Europe by very old people who were children during the last great war. This includes improvising and adjusting when the power supply or mainstream heating fail, an exercise that characterizes Ukrainian everyday life now but terrifies the rest of the continent, even the parts with much more forgiving climates.\n\nMany Russians are capable of finding the means and providing themselves with fruit and vegetables if necessary, and improvising further supplies, just like in Soviet times. In political science, this is called resilience a quality Russia has shown many times in history.\n\nUkrainians had similar experiences in late and post-Soviet times and certainly have a stronger motivation to keep fighting for the survival of their nation. Yet, they have the aforementioned disadvantage of fighting almost entirely on their soil, and the economy already shrunken by around a third is now being further disrupted by Russian attacks on the civilian infrastructure.\n\nIt is unclear how Ukraine can continue to finance its war effort, except by printing money, which would cause even higher inflation. Like any dictator, Putin also has the advantage of not having to hold free elections and having almost total control over the media. While he continues to send fake news to the West through social media, little news about the war reaches Russian society.\n\nAlthough Russia has still not renounced any of its war aims and is committing one war crime after another in Ukraine, there is a lot of talk in Germany and other EU countries about how peace can be restored. But this is a difficult undertaking because Putin is not only concerned with Ukraine. He also wants to restore Russian supremacy within the former sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. That is why he has been demanding the withdrawal of NATO from its latest member states. The concept of this Russian world (ruskij mir) threatens the Baltic peoples in particular.\n\nThe goals of Ukraine and the West arent free of tensions either. At the beginning of the war, when the military situation was quite desperate, Volodymyr Zelensky hinted at giving up Crimea and parts of the Donbas. But since the summer, Ukraine has been confidently demanding the liberation of all of its occupied territories including Crimea and the eastern Donbas. These demands presuppose further rearmament, which the Zelensky government currently cannot afford.\n\nWill western powers be prepared to finance this, despite a recession and rising inflation? It would be wise in terms of their own security interests. But it would also require political and social consensus. Funding Ukraines rearmament would also imply a realization that the EU, and Germany within it, have already become belligerents.\n\nLessons from this most recent history warn us to always clearly state ones own goals, to recognize ones own weaknesses, to never underestimate Putin and to be mindful of a brutal dictatorships ability to hang on for a long time.\n\nSupporters of Putins regime can still enter many EU countries as tourists. We need a more expansive, intelligent sanctions regime; one which also promises incentives for oligarchs and state officials who oppose Putin. We also need a new diplomacy approach towards those states who depend on western trade and aid, but are breaking sanctions for their own benefit.\n\nAnd of course, diplomacy is also needed to approach more intelligently a main player in the background: China. It is puzzling why China has so far not used its key role to become a mediator. Perhaps a prospective increase in prestige could persuade Chinese President Xi Jinping to move even further away from Putin.\n\nFinally, Germany and all other EU states face a national task. Much more effort could be directed toward saving energy, because gas exports continue to fill Putins war chest. We need to prepare already now for a second winter of war. Twinning arrangements between regions, cities, businesses, institutions and families could help Ukraine, not least to repair the infrastructure destroyed by Russia.\n\nEven though it may sound a bit trite, it is nevertheless true: Ukrainians really are defending Europes freedom: they are fighting for their democracy and ours.",

The question arises, for what? Russia has always met us halfway. There is not a single issue that has remained unresolved today. We are meeting the Russian Federation halfway in the most difficult moment,\" Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state news agency BelTA.\n\n\"If someone is hatching up plans to tear us apart, to drive a wedge between us, they will not succeed. In 2020, it was not Russia that attacked us around the perimeter. It was not Russia. Russia extended a helping hand to us. We were attacked from there [from the West]. They wanted to deprive us of both independence and sovereignty,\" he claimed.\n\nBelarus saw mass protests in 2020 after an election that many observers believe was rigged to keep long-term leader Lukashenko in power. The protests were met with a harsh response from Belarus' security services. Lukashenko baselessly blamed the West for inciting the demonstrations. Russia said it was ready to support Lukashenko's leadership should the protests get \"out of control.\"\n\nFollowing months of increased joint military exercises and meetings, concerns have grown that Belarus could enter the Ukraine war to assist Russia (it has already allowed Moscow to launch attacks from its territory). On Monday, Lukashenko said nothing would be able to \"break our relationship\" with Russia but did not mention the possibility of Belarus assisting Russia in the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"So what is there to say? Just one more time: they will not be able to break our relationship. It will only strengthen. Today, in fact, together with the president and our colleagues, we have created a base for the future rapid progress,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nHolly Ellyatt",

(WRIC) Petersburg residents continue to boil their water after being placed on a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nThe unexpected notice comes after construction caused damage to one of the citys main water lines, impacting the tap water for Petersburg residents.\n\nIn an announcement on Wednesday, Dec. 21, the City notified residents that some would experience loss of water services or low water pressure in addition to water discoloration.\n\nTo ensure that the water is safe to drink, residents have been told to boil their water while continuing to conserve water.\n\nRepairs on the main water line have since been completed, however, residents have been urged to continue taking precautionary measures until Friday afternoon.\n\n8News spoke with residents in the area about their concerns and how this has impacted their holiday weekend. Some said they were not aware of the water boil notice until we told them.\n\n\"Id like to hear an explanation as far as, you know, how long this is going to last and whats causing it,\" said John Slatner. \"And, you know, just let people know whats up.\"\n\nThe Petersburg Health Department is advising residents to take the following steps to prevent illness from contaminated water:\n\nBoil water or use bottled water to brush your teeth.\n\nWhen taking a shower, cover any scratches, cuts, or open wounds.\n\nTo wash dishes, either use boiled water then let it cool until hands can comfortably be inserted, use bottled water, or use one tablespoon of unscented bleach per gallon of clean water (no detergents), and immerse dishes, then let them air dry. Do not use your dishwasher to wash dishes, as they use the same public water system.\n\nDo not rely on household filters that are purchased over the counter as they will not remove bacteria from the water. Most filters use carbon, and those filters do a good job of taking out taste and odors but do not take out other contaminants.\n\nAccording to the Virginia Department of Health, there are several reasons why you may be asked to boil your tap water:\n\nIf tests show that harmful microorganisms could be present in the water\n\nIf the water pressure drops due to equipment failure or power outages\n\nDue to water main breaks or repairs\n\nIf the water source has been flooded\n\nDue to any other situations that warrant special action to protect consumers health\n\nIf your water is not safe to drink and you become sick, you are urged to contact your family physician or healthcare provider. You can also call the Virginia Department of Healths Office of Drinking Water at 804-864-7500 for information about the boil water notice.\n\nPetersburg residents and businesses can contact the city about any questions by calling 804-733-2407.",

Video of his arrival at the Rzeszow airport showed Mr. Zelensky bounding down the steps of his plane dressed in green cargo pants, heavy boots and a military-style winter jacket.\n\nMr. Duda, in a message posted on Twitter, said that the two leaders had discussed \"strategic plans for actions and cooperation in the upcoming 2023,\" reaffirming Polands strong support for Ukraines efforts to defend itself against Russias military.\n\nToday's meeting with the President of Ukraine @ZelenskyyUa was not only a great opportunity to send Christmas and New Year wishes to him, his Family and Ukraine, but also gave me an opportunity to discuss strategic plans for actions and cooperation in the upcoming 2023. pic.twitter.com/CfKtkChmU1 Andrzej Duda (@AndrzejDuda) December 22, 2022\n\nAfter weeks of a stalemate along much of the front, Mr. Zelenskys high-profile visit to Washington was greeted in Ukraine mostly with pride and hope that the presidents impassioned in-person appeals would keep American weapons and financial support flowing.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir V. Putins spokesman, said as the Kremlin has argued before that the trip showcased the United States commitment to fighting Russia \"to the last Ukrainian.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Zelenskys visit to Washington ended with promises of billions more in U.S. support, it did not fulfill some of the more critical requests on his weapons wish list: American battle tanks, fighter jets and long-range precision missiles.",

Ukrainian officials said at least 300 people were killed during the Russian bombing, though some estimates said the toll was higher.\n\nRussia denied bombing the theater deliberately.\n\nMariupol held out for more than two months against Russian assaults which left most of its buildings in ruins.\n\n8:50 p.m.:\n\n8 p.m.: Berlin on Friday said the discovery of a German intelligence official suspected of working for Russia is \"alarming,\" amid fears he had access to sensitive information from Western allies, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nThe man an employee of the BND foreign intelligence agency identified as Carsten L. was arrested on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing state secrets to Russia, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.\n\nThe case comes at a time of heightened concerns across Europe about Russian espionage plots, after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine plunged ties with the West into the deep freeze.\n\nAuthorities have released little information about the case so far, saying doing so could hand Russia an advantage.\n\n7:02 p.m.: U.S. nurse Jennifer Mullee is volunteering in Ukraine, near the Donetsk front line, triaging wounded Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nMullee worked as an emergency nurse in a hospital in Los Angeles until May, when she arrived in the eastern region.\n\nAs a member of the Pirogov First Volunteer Mobile Hospital, she's been helping to save Ukrainian lives there ever since.\n\n\"I miss my (two) daughters, but they understand and believe in the struggle of what's going on here in Ukraine and fully support me and know that I'm doing important work,\" she told Reuters inside the ambulance transporting the now stabilized soldier to hospital.\n\nDeployed twice as a nurse and doctor in Afghanistan, Mullee comes from a military family.\n\nNone of her relatives have been wounded on active service, she says, a stark contrast to the \"horrible destruction, and death, and injuries\" she now experiences daily, and for which she lays the blame squarely at the Russian leader's door.\n\n6:22 p.m.:\n\n5:49 p.m.: North Korea on Friday denied a report in Japan that claimed it had sent arms to Russia by train last month, CNN reported.\n\n\"The Japanese media's false report that the DPRK offered munitions to Russia is the most absurd red herring, which is not worth any comment or interpretation,\" a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said according to state media.\n\nJapanese outlet Tokyo Shimbun reported Thursday that North Korea delivered munitions by rail to Russia last month, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation in the country.\n\nAdditional supplies and weapons are expected to be delivered from North Korea to Russia in the upcoming weeks, Tokyo Shimbun reported, citing its source.\n\n4:56 p.m.:\n\n4 p.m.: President Vladimir Putin on Friday told Russia's defense industry chiefs to up their game to ensure that the Russian army quickly got all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needed to fight in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nPutin, who has cast Russia's war in Ukraine as part of an historic effort to push back against what he says is excessive Western influence over global affairs, made the comments during a visit to Tula, a center for arms manufacturing.\n\n3:16 p.m.: People living in the once-thriving settlement of Velyka Novosilka in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region have endured almost 10 months of war. Located less than 2 kilometers from the front line, residents endure Russian shelling by huddling together in cellars, sharing a stove, and keeping each others' spirits up. As children, mothers, and the elderly hang on, they take in abandoned dogs and cats in a town they say has been \"completely destroyed.\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n2:30 p.m.:\n\n2:05 p.m.: U.S. lawmakers were expected to approve a $45 billion aid package for Ukraine on Friday, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy returned from Washington with the promise of Patriot missiles to help fend off Russia's invasion, Reuters reported.\n\nThe military and economic assistance, part of a huge government spending bill, follows U.S. aid worth around $50 billion sent to Ukraine this year as well sanctions imposed on Russia by the West that now include a cap on Russian oil prices.\n\n1:35 p.m.:\n\n1:10 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that Kyiv would boost its footprint in Africa next year by opening 10 new embassies and strengthening trade ties with the continent, according to Reuters.\n\nUkraine has been trying to rally African countries to its cause as it fights off Russia's full-scale invasion, in part by promoting a humanitarian grain initiative to help alleviate hunger in highly vulnerable countries.\n\nRussia's blockade of Ukrainian agricultural exports through the Black Sea had sparked global grain and fertilizer shortages earlier this year, endangering millions, before a U.N.-brokered deal partially eased it in July.\n\n\"We are overhauling relations with dozens of African countries,\" Zelenskyy told a gathering of diplomats in Kyiv. \"Next year we need to strengthen this.\"\n\n12:45 p.m.:\n\n12:30 p.m.: North Korea fired two ballistic missiles toward the sea off its east coast on Friday, the South Korean military said, the latest in an unprecedented number of missile tests this year, Reuters reported.\n\nComing only days after two other missiles were launched and a day after allegations were made the country is shipping munitions to Russian forces in Ukraine, North Korea continued actions its neighbors say are destabilizing the region.\n\n12:15 p.m.:\n\n12:00 p.m.: To an outsider, it may seem an unlikely time for Ukraine to double down on the battle against corruption, as missiles rain down on cities and citizens fight for their lives, Reuters reported.\n\nNonetheless, anti-graft agencies have revived a years-old investigation into an official scheme they say led to electricity customers overpaying by more than $1 billion, plus a case that stalled in 2020 into the alleged theft of over $350 million in assets and funds from a state-controlled oil company.\n\nThey've launched new actions too, including this month the arrest in absentia of an ex-state bank boss over his suspected role in the embezzlement of $5 million. He denies wrongdoing.\n\n\"Every week, there are one or two big developments plus seven or eight smaller ones that are still important,\" said legal expert Vadym Valko, who monitors the work of anti-corruption authorities in Ukraine, which is fighting to rid itself of oligarchs and strengthen its vulnerable institutions.\n\n11:45 a.m.:\n\n11:20 a.m.: Canada on Friday condemned what it said were North Korean arms deliveries to Russia, saying Pyongyang's transaction with the private military company the Wagner Group \"clearly violates international law and United Nations Security Council resolutions,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place,\" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Mlanie Joly said in a statement.\n\n10:50 a.m.:\n\n10:10 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Friday that Russia had made significant progress towards \"demilitarizing\" Ukraine, one of the goals President Vladimir Putin declared when he launched his war against Kyiv 10 months ago, Reuters reported.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov offered the assessment of Russia's military progress when asked during a briefing about comments by Putin, who on Thursday said that Ukraine's defense potential was close to zero.\n\nUkraine's own defense potential - its military industrial complex - has been badly disrupted by Russian missile strikes.\n\nBut the West has poured tens of billions of dollars' worth of weapons into Ukraine and U.S. President Joe Biden this week promised a U.S. Patriot air defense system and pledged continued support.\n\nPutin dismissed the Patriot system as \"quite old\" and said Russia would adapt to it.\n\n9:55 a.m.: The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled nuclear power plant there had \"almost stopped,\" Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking on Russian state television, Russian-installed regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky said that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear power station, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest, was captured by Russian forces in March, soon after their invasion of Ukraine.\n\n9:40 a.m.: The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, met with senior Russian government officials this week regarding a nuclear safety and security zone for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Friday the IAEA said that diplomatic efforts were making some progress.\n\n9:20 a.m.: A St Petersburg politician has asked prosecutors to investigate Russian President Vladimir Putin for using the word \"war\" to describe the conflict in Ukraine, accusing the Kremlin chief of breaking his own law, Reuters reported.\n\nPutin has for months described his invasion as a \"special military operation\". He signed laws in March that prescribe steep fines and jail terms for discrediting or spreading \"deliberately false information\" about the armed forces, putting people at risk of prosecution if they call the war by its name.\n\n9:05 a.m.:\n\n8:50 a.m.: Russia's ambassador to the United States on Friday compared the state of U.S.-Russia relations to an \"ice age\", and said that the risk of a clash between the two countries was \"high,\" Reuters reported, quoting Russian state-owned news agency TASS.\n\nTASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been \"effective\" and would continue.\n\nU.S.-Russia ties have fallen to their lowest point in decades amid the fallout from Russia's military campaign in Ukraine, and the consequent imposition of Western sanctions.\n\nTwo prisoner swaps, in which U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed and basketball star Brittney Griner were freed by Russia in return for convicted drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko and arms dealer Viktor Bout, were rare instances of successful U.S.-Russia diplomacy in 2022.\n\n8:20 a.m.:\n\n8:10 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sounded another defiant note on his return to his nations capital Friday following his wartime visit to the United States, saying his forces are \"working toward victory\" even as Russia warned that there would be no end to the war until it achieved its military aims, The Associated Press reported.\n\nZelenskyy posted on his Telegram account that hes in his Kyiv office following his U.S. trip that secured a new $1.8 billion military aid package, and pledged that \"well overcome everything.\" The Ukrainian president also thanked the Netherlands for pledging up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.65 billion) for 2023, to help pay for military equipment and rebuild critical infrastructure.\n\nZelenksyys return comes amid relentless Russian artillery, rocket and mortar fire as well as airstrikes on the eastern and southern fronts and elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the war would end at the negotiating table once the \"special military operation\" achieves \"the goals that the Russian Federation has set,\" adding that \"a significant headway has been made on demilitarization of Ukraine.\"\n\n7:55 a.m.:\n\n7:40 a.m.: The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled nuclear power plant there had \"almost stopped,\" according to Reuters.\n\nSpeaking on Russian state television, Russian-installed regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky said that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear power station, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest, was captured by Russian forces in March, soon after their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe plant remains near the frontlines, and has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the facility.\n\n7:25 a.m.:\n\n7:10 a.m.: An employee of Germany's foreign intelligence service has been arrested on suspicion of sharing state secrets that he obtained in the course of his professional activities with Russia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, quoting federal prosecutors on December 22.\n\nThe arrest of the suspect, a German citizen identified as Carsten L., occurred in Berlin on December 21, and he has been ordered held in pretrial detention. \"The accused is suspected of state treason,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement quoted by Reuters and German international broadcaster Deutsche Welle.\n\nHe shared the information, which is considered a state secret, with a Russian intelligence agency, the federal prosecutor said. The statement said police also raided his apartment and workplace as well as those of another person.\n\nGerman authorities have warned of likely heightened Russian spying in light of its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. It is unclear exactly what information Carsten L. passed on, but the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) said the incident took place this year.\n\n6:50 a.m.: The cities of Bucha and Irpin in the Kyiv region were both heavily damaged during the brief but brutal occupation by Russian forces at the start of their invasion of Ukraine. Many houses were completely destroyed or in need of major repairs. But the Ukrainian government lacks the funds for widespread reconstruction, leaving many residents forced to restore their own homes. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report.\n\n6:35 a.m.: At least five civilians were killed and 18 others were wounded in Russian attacks on eight regions in Ukraines south and east in the past 24 hours, The Associated Press reported, quoting the deputy head of Ukraines presidential office.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said Russian forces fired multiple rocket launchers \"more than 70 times\" across Ukrainian territory overnight, while fierce battles raged around the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Bakhmut and Lyman in the neighboring Luhansk region as well as the front line between the Luhansk and Kharkiv regions bore the brunt of the Russian strikes, but didnt specify to what degree.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said several blasts tore through factory buildings housing Russian troops in the occupied city of Tokmak in the southern Zaporizhzhia region late on Thursday, sparking a fire. The Center for Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine didnt immediately report on casualties or who was behind the blasts.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Ukrainian mayor of the southern city of Melitopol said that a car used by Russian occupation forces exploded, although its unclear if anyone was hurt. The reports came a day after a car bomb killed the Russia-appointed head of the village of Lyubymivka in the neighboring Kherson region, according to Russian and Ukrainian news reports.\n\n6:20 a.m.:\n\n6:05 a.m.: Pitched battles continue in the east of Ukraine, where Moscow's offensive has centered on the cities of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Friday, citing Ukraine's General Staff.\n\nBesides their incessant shelling of Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, where the fiercest battles have been fought in recent months, Russians kept pounding military and civilian locations in three other eastern regions -- Sumy, Kharkiv, and Luhansk, the General Staff said, adding that Ukrainian forces repelled a total of 19 attacks over the past 24 hours.\n\nIt also said that because of the significant losses suffered, the Russian military had set up a field hospital in Berdyansk in the Zaporizhzhya region, where it has also converted several tourist resorts into quarters for military personnel.\n\nIn Moscow, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the front line in Ukraine was stable, and that Russian forces had been focused on \"completing the liberation\" of Donetsk.\n\n5:55 a.m.:\n\n5:45 a.m.: In Ukraine's southern Azov Sea port city of Mariupol, which fell earlier this year following months of resistance by Ukrainian forces, Russian troops on December 22 started demolishing the famed Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported, quoting Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor, on Telegram.\n\nThe theater, a historical monument which at the start of the Russian invasion had been converted into a bomb shelter for about 600 people, including many children, was repeatedly targeted by Russian air strikes despite being clearly marked as a refuge for civilians.\n\n\"The demolition is a clear attempt to hide forever the physical evidence of the largest simultaneous deliberate killing of Ukrainians by the Russians since the beginning of this phase of the war,\" Andryushchenko wrote, adding that only the front part of the theater had been left intact, apparently as a basis for future reconstruction.\n\n5:20 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest Ukraine assessment that Russian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks along the Kreminna-Svatove line and Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the Kreminna area. Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Bakhmut and Avdiivka areas. They're also increasing security measures in Kherson Oblast and Crimea out of fear of Ukrainian counteroffensive operations.\n\n4:12 a.m.: The latest intelligence update from the U.K. defense ministry said that Russia plans to expand its military by about 30%, which would bring its total forces to 1.5 million.\n\nAccording to Russia's defense ministry, the expansion will target northwest Russia, in response to the supposed threat from Finland and Sweden. Both countries recently joined NATO.\n\n1:22 a.m.: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right government backs Kyiv, on Thursday said she wanted to visit Ukraine early next year, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nMeloni has reaffirmed support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion, although her government includes the far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia parties.\n\nBoth Matteo Salvini of the League party and former premier Berlusconi have long enjoyed warm relations with Russia.\n\n\"I will call (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy to present my wishes and to organize this trip that I intend to make in the first months of next year,\" Meloni said during a program on Italian television.\n\nMeloni's predecessor, Mario Draghi, visited Kyiv in June with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\n12:02 a.m.:\n\nSome information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",

Most Ukrainians are orthodox Christians and mark the occasion in early January. \"We will endure this winter because we know what we are fighting for,\" he said.\n\nThe clip, which lasted about nine minutes, was filmed outside at night with just a few white lights and a Christmas tree in the background. Relentless Russian missile and drone attacks since October have caused massive damage to the power-generating system, regularly leaving big cities without water and heat.\n\n\"Even in complete darkness, we will find each other to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will embrace each other for a long time to warm one another,\" the Ukrainian president said.\n\n\"We will smile and be happy, as always. There is one difference we will not wait for a miracle, since we are creating it ourselves,\" he added.\n\nKilling for pleasure\n\nShortly before the defiant message, Zelenskyy had published photos of the attack in Kherson, showing streets strewn with burning cars, smashed windows and bodies.\n\n\"Social networks will most likely mark these photos as sensitive content. But this is not sensitive content it is the real life of Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" he wrote.\n\n\"These are not military facilities It is terror, it is killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.\"\n\nRegional Governor Yaroslav Yanushevych reported in a Telegram post that 10 people had died and 55 were wounded in the attack on Kherson, with 18 in serious condition.\n\nUkrainian presidential aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said the attack came from a grad multiple-rocket launcher, while Yuriy Sobolevskyi, deputy chair of the regional council, said the missile landed next to a supermarket by the citys Freedom Square.\n\nAmong the victims was a butcher named Lesha who had been working at the market for many years, according to 43-year-old resident Oleksandr Kudryashov.\n\n\"He came out to have a smoke, he was standing right here. We pulled his body, he was already dead,\" Kudryashov told the AFP news agency, pointing at a bloody staircase.\n\nWhile Ukraine blamed Russian forces for the attack, a pro-Moscow official said the Ukrainian forces had launched the assault in a bid to pin the blame on the Russian military.\n\n\"This is a disgusting provocation with the obvious aim of blaming the Russian armed forces,\" said Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-appointed governor of the region, which is partly controlled by Russia.\n\nUkraine retook Kherson, the only regional capital Russia had taken since its February 24 invasion, in November. Since then, Kyiv says, Russian forces have heavily shelled the city from across the vast Dnieper River.\n\nA senior aide to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, criticised those calling for Kyiv to seek peace talks with Russia, referencing the attack on Kherson as well as Moscows relentless pounding of Ukraines power grid.\n\n\"Ill remind those who propose to take into account [Russian] peace initiatives: Right now Russia is negotiating, killing Kherson residents, wiping out Bakhmut, destroying Kyiv/Odesa grids, torturing civilians in Melitopol,\" Podolyak wrote.\n\n\"Russia wants to kill with impunity. Shall we allow it?\"",

                "cc_text": "Cars are seen on December 16 during a power blackout after critical infrastructure was hit by Russian missile attacks in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Gleb Garanich/Reuters)\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed again on Tuesday to \"work tirelessly with the G7 and other partners to repair, replace, and defend Ukraines energy infrastructure\" as it faces a tough winter of Russian attacks.\n\nBut that effort will not come without challenges.\n\nAn initial tranche of US electrical equipment, which a US official told CNN included big items like circuit breakers, relays, disconnectors, arrived in Ukraine more than a week ago part of a multimillion dollar pledge by the Biden administration to help to support Ukraines electrical system.\n\nHowever, as the US and its partners work to try to supply the capital of Kyiv with the supplies it needs to keep the electricity and heat on this winter, they have had to contend with worldwide supply chain issues, the US official said.\n\nThere is a global effort to try to deal with this, the official explained, and the US is working with the private sector to try to narrow the gap in equipment, but with the existing supply chain issues, there is not as much extra supply.\n\nOther challenges: Some of the \"bigger ticket\" items that are used in the United States are not compatible in Ukraine, as they are designed to work on different frequency grids, the official told CNN.\n\nThe US hopes that the provision of air defense systems will help counter the barrage of Russian attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, so that the equipment provided by the US and partners is not destroyed.\n\nBy attacking the infrastructure, the Russians have made defense and recovery of the grid much more complicated, the official explained, because there are so many more places the system can go down than if they were to attack a power plant.\n\nIn the short term, the US is trying to locate items the Ukrainians have prioritized, such as large gas generators. These generators would not be used to power individual homes, the US official said, but rather would be used to keep critical utilities such as water and heat on even if the electricity is down.\n\nThe official explained that even when the electrical grid is repaired, it cannot immediately be run on full capacity or it risks blowing out, so Ukrainian officials likely will need to keep rolling blackouts until they can ensure the patched electrical grid can sustain itself, the official said.",

Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\n\nAs the battle for Ukraine turns into a bloody, mile-by-mile fight in numbing cold, Ukrainian and Russian officials have insisted that they are willing to discuss making peace. But it is increasingly clear that both sides demands even to start talks are flatly unacceptable to the other, leading American and European officials to conclude that serious discussions on ending the war are unlikely in the near future.\n\nThere have been no peace talks between Ukraine and Russia since the early weeks of the conflict, which began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24. This week, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, detailed a proposal for a \"peace\" summit by the end of February, but told The Associated Press that Kyiv would negotiate with Moscow only if Russia first faced a war-crimes tribunal.\n\nRussias foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, responded that Kyiv would have to accept Moscows demands including giving up the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow claimed to have annexed in September or else \"the Russian Army will deal with this issue.\"\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Wednesday that \"there cannot be a peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account todays realities with Russian territory,\" including the four annexed regions, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nStella Ghervas, a professor of Russian history at Newcastle University in Britain, said that \"the Ukrainian proposal offers a glimpse at Ukraines vision of how the war with Russia could one day end.\" But, she said, \"Lavrovs reaction is not very promising, and its an indicator that a peace negotiation could be months and months away.\"\n\nThe hard-line positions suggest that both sides believe they have more to gain militarily. Ukraine holds the battlefield momentum, having retaken much of the land that Russia captured early in the war, although Moscows forces still occupy large chunks of the east and south. And Russia is pressing its own advantage, readying more troops and launching aerial attacks on infrastructure that have deepened Ukrainians misery even as Russias army struggles on the ground.\n\nLast month, addressing a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 nations, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine presented a wide-ranging 10-point peace plan that called for the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern area known as the Donbas that Russian forces seized beginning in 2014.\n\nIt also demands an international tribunal to try Russian war crimes; Moscows release of all political prisoners and those forcibly deported during the war; compensation from Russia for war damages; and steps by the international community to ensure the safety of Ukraines nuclear power plants and provide for its food and energy security.\n\nIt is a much tougher set of requirements than Ukrainian negotiators initially offered at talks in Istanbul a month after Russias invasion, when they proposed adopting neutral status in effect abandoning a bid to join NATO, which Russia has long opposed in exchange for security guarantees from other nations. Russian atrocities have multiplied since then, and the damage to Ukraines cities and its economy has deepened. In August, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said that the framework proposed in Istanbul was no longer viable.\n\n\"The emotional background in Ukraine has changed very, very much,\" he told the BBC. \"We have seen too many war crimes live.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said over the weekend that he was prepared to negotiate over \"acceptable outcomes,\" without specifying what those might be, while making clear that he had no intention of ending his attacks.\n\nWestern officials have dismissed Mr. Putins periodic offers to negotiate as empty gestures. Even as Russias economy shrinks under Western sanctions Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Wednesday that the Russian economy had contracted by 2 percent over the past 11 months Mr. Putin has emphasized that there are \"no limits\" to Russias military spending. This month, his defense minister ordered another expansion of the armed services by more than 300,000 members, to a target size of 1.5 million.\n\nAll of that suggests, said Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and Eastern European politics at the University of Oxford, that \"there is not necessarily a push for a negotiated peace or even some sort of negotiations, but still a push for whatever endgame is being sought militarily.\"",

                "cc_text": "With the White House expected to announce the release of a Patriot battery for Ukraines use, there is once again a debate raging in Washington about what new equipment can, or should, be sent to Kyivs aid. In the following op-ed, John Hardie and Bradley Bowman argue that there is another capability the Biden administration should clear for Ukraines defense a fairly cheap weapon with a long-range to strike at Russian targets.\n\nThe Kremlin on Dec. 13 rejected a Ukrainian peace proposal that called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine, instead insisting that Kyiv should simply accept the \"new realities\" and cede its occupied territories to Moscow. Its a clear sign from Moscow: theyre not interested in this war ending anytime soon. To help Ukraine defeat Russias invasion and liberate its land and people, Washington needs to redouble efforts to provide Ukrainians with the weapons they need.\n\nOne way to do that, which is apparently now under consideration, is sending Kyiv the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB). This system, which integrates an existing munition and rocket at a relatively low cost, would enable the Ukrainian military to strike high-value Russian targets well beyond the range of current Western-supplied munitions. That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory. For this reason, the Pentagon should move without delay to provide Kyiv with the GLSDB.\n\nA joint project by Saab and Boeing, the GLSDB marries two affordable, combat-proven systems: the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, a 113 kg precision-guided munition that is relatively cheap at around $40,000 each, and the M26, a low-cost, formerly demilitarized rocket. The system could include a multi-purpose warhead tailored for fixed, hardened, low collateral damage, and moving targets.\n\nThe GLSDB would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian military targets up to 150 km away with an accuracy of around one meter. With integration, the GLSDB can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS rocket artillery systems already supplied to Ukraine by the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nBut it can also be fired by non-traditional launchers, such as from the back of an ordinary-looking truck or from a nondescript shipping container hidden in plain sight. That would make it more difficult for Russian forces to find and destroy the system. The non-traditional launcher also makes the system a low-cost option to augment HIMARS, which US industry is currently racing to produce in order to both replace US launchers sent to Ukraine and meet demand from allies.\n\nOne of the great advantages of the GLSDB is that the munition and rocket already exist in the US arsenal. Industry would only need to integrate the munition and rocket rather than undertaking the time-consuming process of establishing a new production line. Accordingly, depending on several factors, Ukraine could receive an initial delivery of two launchers and 24 weapons in as little as nine months after the Pentagon approves the plan. If industry and the Pentagon move with a sense of urgency and Congress provides assertive oversight, a decision now by the Department of Defense could see an estimated 750 GLSDBs and 12 launchers delivered to Ukraine by the end of 2024. That dramatic ramp up in production is possible because industry simply needs to integrate existing bombs and rockets rather than build new ones.\n\nThats the how. Heres the why: Providing the GLSDB would enhance Ukraines ability to weaken Russian forces by hitting high-value targets deep behind the front lines.\n\nUkraine has employed this strategy to great effect since it received its M142 and M270 systems over the summer, striking key bridges, ammunition and fuel depots, command-and-control nodes, and other high-value targets in Russias rear. This has helped Ukraine halt Russias advances and played a critical role in Ukraines successful counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts.\n\nBut whereas the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets provided for Ukraines M142 and M270 systems can hit targets from around 85 kilometers away, the GLSDB would enable the Ukrainian military to strike targets at almost double that range. For example, the key Russian logistics hub in Luhansk city and its environs, just out of reach of GMLRS, would be well within the GLSDBs range. The same goes for the critical rail hub in the Crimean city of Dzhankoi, which supplies Russias grouping in southern Ukraine. Nearby settlements house major vehicle parks ripe for targeting.\n\nIf Ukraine had the GLSDB, Russia would be forced to move its depots even farther back from the front line, making it more difficult for Russian logistics to provide combat units with sufficient ammunition and other supplies to hold back Ukrainian forces, let alone take ground themselves. Likewise, Ukraine could strike various airbases from which Russian aircraft provide close air support to Russian troops or launch missiles targeting Ukraines critical infrastructure. GLSDB would also help Kyiv target bases in Ukraine from which Russian forces are launching Iranian drones.\n\nIndeed, the best form of air and missile defense includes an offensive strike capability.\n\nThe GLSDB could fulfill some of the missions that would be assigned to ATACMS missiles, which are also fired by the M142 and M270 but have a 300-kilometer range. For months, Kyiv has pleaded for ATACMS. But the White House has refused, fearing that providing these missiles could invite further provocation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis risk is overstated when it comes to ATACMS, and the Biden administration should not let similar fears deter it from sending the GLSDB. Thus far, Moscows reaction to the Wests provision of military aid to Kyiv has featured lots of bark but little bite. Western materiel has enabled Ukraine to stay in the fight and eventually retake large swathes of land, including Ukrainian territory Putin has cynically labeled as part of Russia.\n\nWhile Moscow has escalated attacks in Ukraine, the Kremlin has assiduously avoided attacking any NATO member, despite the Western weapons flowing into Ukraine. Theres little doubt why: Doing so would risk a direct conflict with the United States, something Putin appears keen to avoid, particularly when the bulk of his military is tied down in Ukraine and badly battered.\n\nAs an extra precaution, the Biden administration could condition its provision of the GLSDB on a Ukrainian commitment to use the system only against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Kyiv has honored a similar promise made with respect to HIMARS, and theres every reason to believe the Ukrainians would keep their word with the GLSDB.\n\nThe Kremlin wants Kyiv and the West to accept \"new realities\" in Ukraine following Russias unprovoked invasion. That would be a disaster, inviting more aggression in the future from authoritarian regimes seeking to bully beleaguered democracies and seize territory by force.\n\nIn Ukraine, the United States has a partner willing to fight for our shared interests and principles. They arent asking Americans to do the fighting for them. They are simply asking for the means to defend their homes.\n\nThe GLSDB would provide Ukraine with a powerful tool to advance US and Ukrainian interests. Every day the Pentagon delays its decision on the GLSDB is another day Ukraine will go without this valuable capability. There is no time to waste.\n\nJohn Hardie is deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), where Bradley Bowman is senior director of FDDs Center on Military and Political Power.",

(Wojciech Grzedzinski for The Washington Post)\n\nListen 27 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save\n\nKHARKIV, Ukraine After weeks of fighting for scraps of territory on the wars bloodiest front, Oleh, a 21-year-old Ukrainian company commander, was summoned suddenly last August, along with thousands of other soldiers, to an obscure rendezvous point in the Kharkiv region. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight At his last position, relentless Russian artillery fire had stalked his mens every step. But here, in a patch of villages, farmland and streams in Ukraines northeast, the quiet was deeply alarming. \"The silence bothered me the most,\" Oleh said. \"It seemed off. How could this be?\"\n\nEven more unsettling were the orders his superiors handed down: to charge as far as 40 miles into enemy territory at high speed in an audacious, top-secret counteroffensive directly between the Russian-occupied stronghold of Izyum and Russias own Belgorod region dotted with military bases. It seemed preposterous. \"Some kind of dubious operation,\" Oleh said.\n\nBut after a summer of heavy Russian casualties and President Vladimir Putins refusal to conscript reinforcements, the Kremlins troops were badly depleted. A shift of units south to defend the captured regional capital of Kherson amid talk of a big Ukrainian push there had left the Kharkiv area exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a stunning vulnerability, confirmed by Ukrainian reconnaissance teams and small drones. And Kyiv would exploit it to change the dynamic of the war, and achieve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys goal of redrawing the battlefield map before winter.\n\nAfter Russias invasion began on Feb. 24, Ukrainian troops forced Russias retreat from Kyiv in an underdog triumph that ended the first stage of the conflict. Thwarted from conquering the capital, Russia concentrated its power in the south and east, pummeling Ukrainian forces until new, longer-range weapons arrived from the United States and Europe and helped stall Moscows advances. Ukraine had survived but, after a half-year of war, one-quarter of its territory was still occupied and its military had failed to show it could launch an offensive to retake substantial ground.\n\nThat was about to change.\n\nIn early September, Ukrainian forces would steamroll across hundreds of square miles, routing the Russians and surprising themselves. The Kharkiv offensive revealed the inability of an undermanned and underequipped Russian force to hold territory across a vast front. It shocked the Kremlin, and it proved to Ukraines supporters that they were not wasting billions in weapons and economic aid.\n\nPutin was forced to conscript hundreds of thousands of men, making the costs of war clear to a Russian population that had isolated itself from its leaders \"special military operation.\" The mobilization set off unrest but was too late to stop Ukraines momentum from spreading south to Kherson, where, after hard combat and significant losses, Kyivs forces in November recaptured the only regional capital that Putin had seized since the start of the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis reconstruction of the Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives is based on interviews with more than 35 people, including Ukrainian commanders, officials in Kyiv and combat troops, as well as senior U.S. and European military and political officials.\n\nAreas reclaimed by Ukraine through counteroffensives Russian-held areas BELARUS RUSSIA Chernihiv Belgorod Sumy Valuyki Kyiv Kharkiv Izyum Starobilsk UKRAINE UKRAINE Balakliya LUHANSK Cherkasy Slovyansk Luhansk Dnipro Donetsk DONETSK Zaporizhzhia Kherson ZAPORIZHZHIA Area held by Russian- backed separatists since 2014 Mariupol Melitopol Mykolaiv MOL.

Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, who commanded the Kharkiv offensive. \"That is, they saw that we could achieve victory and the help they were providing was being used with effect.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nII\n\nIn the last days of August, Syrsky met in a large operations room in Ukraines east with his top aides and key brigade commanders. Before them was a 520-square-foot 3D-printed terrain map of the part of the Kharkiv region occupied by Russia.\n\nEach commander walked the path of his units planned assault amid the replica cities, hills and rivers, acting out its mission and discussing coordination, contingencies and worst-case scenarios. Officers used laser pointers to spotlight trouble spots.\n\n\"It was painstaking work,\" Syrsky said.\n\nSince at least the spring, Syrsky had been considering the Kharkiv region, and the strategic cities of Balakliya and Izyum, as vulnerable points for the Russians.\n\nAlla, 52, claims Russian forces brutalized her and her husband for 10 days during the occupation of Izyum. (Video: Whitney Shefte, Jon Gerberg/The Washington Post)\n\nHe started thinking about how he would conduct an offensive by driving deep into Russian-held territory from an unexpected area north of the two cities, cutting off Russian forces from reserves across the nearby border and putting both Balakliya and Izyum at risk of encirclement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe geography and the positioning of Russian forces convinced him it could be accomplished in a single, rapid blow ideally so fast that Russia would not be able to regroup.\n\nWhen orders went out from the Ukrainian General Staff last summer for commanders to come up with possible diversionary operations to draw Russian forces away from the defense of Kherson, Syrsky knew what he would propose.\n\n\"The enemy thought that, because so many forces had been built up in Izyum and more were stationed over the Russian border in the Belgorod region, youd have to be crazy to move and try to strike right in the middle and split the two,\" Syrsky said. \"But the thought was there.\"\n\nIn the early stages of the war, Russia had converted Izyum into a military stronghold, eyeing the city as the base for a pincer movement that would surround Ukrainian forces in the east. At the height of its preparations, according to Syrsky, Russia had amassed 24 battalion tactical groups about 18,000 troops in Izyum and surrounding towns, along with stockpiles of weapons and ammunition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy August, in part thanks to detailed intelligence supplied by the United States, Syrsky saw that the number of battalions in Izyum had dropped by at least half, as Russia relocated its most experienced fighters to Kherson.\n\n\"In the history of wars, there have been many cases when an attack on a diversionary axis that is, on a secondary axis turns into the main axis,\" Syrsky said. \"The prospects were all there, because the enemy absolutely didnt expect that we would attack in the exact place where we delivered the main blow.\"\n\nSyrsky calculated that Ukraine could not afford the losses that would come with attacking towns and cities head-on. Instead, he planned to sweep across the front, encircling population centers and forcing the enemy to retreat.\n\nSpeed was essential. If the Russians sent in reserves from across the border, large numbers of Ukrainian troops could get cut off behind enemy lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everything depended on the first day how far we could break through,\" Syrsky said. \"The farther we went, the less they could do, the more their units would be cut off and isolated under psychological pressure.\"\n\nBy August, the Ukrainians had all but run out of the Soviet-era ammunition used by most of their artillery. Western allies were rushing in NATO-standard ammunition and systems but not enough.\n\nIn a risky decision, Ukraine moved some of the most valuable Western weapons systems away from hotter spots on the eastern front. Each attacking brigade was armed with at least eight M777 howitzers, commanders said. In some cases, the M777s arrived at encampments the night before the assault began. Extra drones were also brought in to ensure that brigades could pinpoint targets and use less ammunition.\n\nMaj. Gen. Andriy Malinovsky, head of missile forces and artillery training for the Ukrainian army, was still worried the force could need more than 100,000 munitions. The Ukrainians had only tens of thousands not enough for a protracted slog. (Ultimately, Malinovsky said, they used about 32,500 over five days).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. intelligence helped ration the ammunition through accurate targeting. After many months, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the two partners had worked out a real-time regimen: The Ukrainians would outline the types of high-value targets they were looking for in an area, and the United States would use its vast geospatial intelligence apparatus to respond with precise locations.\n\nThe Americans, however, were not deeply involved in planning the Kharkiv offensive and learned about it relatively late, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.\n\nDespite attempts at secrecy, the Russians eventually realized that the Ukrainians were up to something.\n\nThanks to Russian bureaucracy, Syrsky said, the information \"didnt reach anyone or it wasnt taken into account.\"\n\nAt the Pentagon, officials suspected that Russias leadership didnt fully realize the vulnerabilities on the Kharkiv front because battlefield commanders were lying. Another hypothesis, a senior U.S. defense official said, was that Russia saw the onslaught coming but didnt have enough men to stop it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ukrainians moved pontoon bridges around, hoping to trick the Russians into expecting a direct assault on Izyum, rather than a drive deep into territory some 30 miles northwest.\n\nBy mid-August, Syrsky was confident the plan would work but he needed to sell it to Zelensky. He described the mission as a chance to liberate a large swath of territory with minimal resources and losses.\n\nZelensky, craving a big battlefield win, approved the attack.\n\nIII\n\nOn Sept. 6, just past 3:30 a.m., Olehs company of about 100 soldiers, part of the 25th Airborne Assault Brigade, began to advance in small columns of three infantry fighting vehicles each. For hours before they started to move, Ukrainian artillerymen had been pounding Russian positions with U.S.-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems.\n\nCommand posts. Ammunition depots. Fuel storage facilities. The firing was relentless. Across the front, Ukrainian military officials later said, Russian soldiers or their separatist proxies struggled to receive orders or coordinate with nearby forces as the rockets rained down. Some troops began to retreat.\n\n\"We broke through the front line, and the enemy started panicking,\" Oleh said, speaking on the condition he be referred to by his first name because his relatives live in Russian-occupied territory. \"They were panicking because we attacked all front-line positions at once the entire front line itself was enormous and everywhere there was a breakthrough.\"\n\nLiudmila Trykushenko and her husband were sleeping next to each other in their cellar to hide from the shelling happening in their hometown. (Video: Whitney Shefte, Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n\nBy the end of that first day, Olehs company had advanced about 11 miles with little resistance, reaching the edge of Volokhiv Yar, a picturesque town in a ravine. Capturing this key junction would allow Ukrainian forces to block two major highways heading into Izyum and Balakliya.\n\nThat morning, Evhenii Andrushenko woke up to four Russian tanks parked in front of his home in Volokhiv Yar. Soldiers were sitting in a gazebo alongside his fence, he said. \"They were sitting there drinking beer,\" Andrushenko said. \"And talking about where to run.\"\n\nDetail Kyiv Ukraines successful Kharkiv counteroffensive required two simultaneous advances into Russian- held areas: Russian-controlled area Belgorod RUSSIA Toward Kupyansk and points north Toward Izyum and points south Vovchansk Area recaptured by Ukraine in Sept.

They had accomplished their first objective. And just as quickly they moved on, racing southeast for several days, with relatively little resistance, into spaces abandoned by Russian forces.\n\nUnder the original battle plan, the company, by Day 7, was to take up a position on a ridge north of Izyum, some 40 miles from the offensives starting point. But the day before, Oleh was summoned with other company commanders to a meeting. \"Half the units in Izyum, maybe even the majority, are simply fleeing,\" their battalion commander said. \"So, were entering Izyum.\"\n\nOlehs company went first and dug in at the first Russian checkpoint in the city. Within minutes, a boxy Zhiguli sedan with flags and the painted letter \"Z\" a symbol of the invaders came speeding up the road filled with fighters.\n\nIf they were trying to flee, they were headed in the wrong direction.\n\n\"Come this way, my sweet,\" Oleh said.\n\nA soldier blasted the car with a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\n\"Enemy eliminated,\" he said.\n\nIn the distance, the Ukrainian troops could see other Russian vehicles heading in the correct direction out of the city.\n\n\"We expected that we would fulfill all the missions of the operation,\" Syrsky said. \"But that there would be this kind of cascading collapse I didnt expect that.\"\n\nWhen Olehs company entered central Izyum, having made it there without any losses, the troops were dumbfounded at what lay before them: Tanks in working order, ready to be driven. Abandoned artillery pieces, ready to be fired. Fuel tankers \"filled up to the eyeballs.\" Tons of ammunition and light weapons.\n\nThe Russian troops had had everything they needed for a serious defense, Oleh thought, except the will to fight and, apparently, enough men. Even the elite Russian units left in the area bolted, realizing Moscow had no backup cavalry to send.\n\n\"When we entered Izyum, some kind of feeling arose, like the taste of victory,\" said the companys 36-year-old chief sergeant, Anton Chornyi. \"It seemed to everyone like the beginning of the end.\"\n\nOleh fired up his Starlink satellite internet and placed a call. Some 75 miles east of where he stood, his parents were living under occupation in the city of Starobilsk in the Luhansk region.\n\n\"What on earth are you guys up to over there?\" his father asked. Russian forces in Starobilsk had just fled, his father said, and separatist fighters were now manning the checkpoints.\n\nOleh told him they had taken Izyum and chased the Russians out of hundreds of square miles of territory in a matter of days.\n\n\"Well done! Well done!\" his father said.\n\n\"Dont worry,\" Oleh said. \"Soon well be in Starobilsk.\"\n\nHe wasnt fully kidding. Oleh, it seemed, could soon be going home.\n\nIV\n\nThe rout in the Kharkiv region rocked Moscow.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nPutins refusal for months to take the political risk of announcing a draft had had disastrous consequences.\n\nLeft with little choice, he declared what he called a \"partial mobilization\" to conscript up to 300,000 troops, his biggest and riskiest escalation since the start of the war. Hundreds of thousands of Russian men fled the country in a frenzy.\n\nIn a speech, Putin characterized the mobilization as a necessary step to fend off Western nations bent on destroying Russia. He also suggested he might use nuclear weapons.\n\n\"This is not a bluff,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin sped up his annexation plans, declaring Ukraines Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions to be part of Russia despite lacking full control over them.\n\n\"I want the Kyiv authorities and their real masters in the West to hear me, so that they remember this,\" Putin said in a speech. \"People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever.\"\n\nOn Oct. 8, Putin also designated Gen. Sergei Surovikin the first sole commander to lead Russias war across the entire theater.\n\nWith a direct line to Surovikin, Putin began to receive a more unvarnished picture of the problems on the battlefield, according to two people familiar with the matter, who said that previously Putin had been given overly rosy assessments by his top defense officials.\n\nThe peril of his disconnect from reality could not be mistaken. Zelensky had arrived to stand in the center of Izyum.\n\nV\n\nAfter his companys victory, Olehs soldiers spent about a week in Izyum in mid-September, relishing the thought that the wars end was near. Then they headed southeast, crossing into the Donetsk region on orders to retake the city of Lyman.\n\nReality resurfaced along the way.\n\nIn a line of trees near the village of Korovii Yar, the company came under fire from three Russian tanks. Five men from Olehs company were killed, according to the chief sergeant. Twelve were wounded, including a squadron commander who led his soldiers for four hours after shrapnel ravaged his jaw. The Ukrainians ultimately took the village, Oleh said, but the racing advance had stalled to something tougher and slower.\n\nGains in the direction of Lyman would be hard-fought.\n\nOleh was 13 years old in 2014 when war came to his native Luhansk region. The Kremlin fueled a separatist conflict, forcing Kyiv to fight for the predominantly Russian-speaking territory in the east. But even in an area that historically had Russian sympathies, a young Oleh was always sure of his stance.\n\n\"Im not a herd, and I dont have a shepherd,\" he said. \"I was born and raised in an independent country. I have my own opinion, which in Ukraine has a right to live and exist. I dont know how it is in Russia.\"\n\nAfter ninth grade, Oleh left for a local military school, then enrolled at the Odessa Military Academy in the department of airborne assault forces. Three and a half years into his four-year degree, war broke out. The students were sent straight to the front. Oleh ended up back in Ukraines east, first as a platoon commander and later as a company commander, leading soldiers who in many cases were years older than he was.\n\nAfter Korovii Yar, the company moved farther south, taking up a position outside Lyman. The Russians in the city were nearly surrounded, but unlike their compatriots in Izyum, they fought.\n\n\"There was so much enemy artillery fire everything they had, all the artillery they had, the tanks, everything, was unloading right onto us, onto us, onto us,\" Oleh said. The only route out of Lyman for the Russians was a road with little cover. Finally, one night, the Ukrainian company heard the rumble of a large column of vehicles and covered the road with artillery fire.\n\nLyman, too, had fallen.\n\nIn the days since, Olehs company has advanced 17 miles east, just past the border of the Luhansk region, where Russia is deploying drafted conscripts by the truckload onto the front line 36 miles from his hometown.\n\n\"Its still quite a long ways to my city,\" Oleh said. \"But every day we get closer and closer. I cant wait.\"\n\nVI\n\nKharkiv gave the Ukrainians a chance to push on an open door. Kherson presented a solid wall.\n\nOver months of occupation, the Russians had dug trenches and built large defenses. The farmland of the steppe offered little natural cover for an attacking force, and a maze of irrigation canals as obstacles. Moscow had brought in its best troops.\n\n\"The minefields they set up there they practically didnt know themselves how many they set up. Everyone who came there would change them and add additional minefields,\" said Maj. Gen. Andriy Kovalchuk, who was tasked with leading the Kherson counteroffensive. \"We didnt have the option to advance rapidly.\"\n\nTo decide how to go about the operation, Ukrainian commanders arrived in Germany last July for a war-gaming session with their American and British counterparts.\n\nAt the time, the Ukrainians were considering a far broader counteroffensive across the entire southern front, including a drive to the coast in the Zaporizhzhia region that would sever Moscows coveted \"land bridge\" connecting mainland Russia with Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nIn a room full of maps and spreadsheets, the Ukrainians ran their own \"tabletop exercise,\" describing the order of battle what formations they would use, where the units would go and in what sequence and the likely Russian response.\n\nThe American and British war-gamers ran their own simulations using the same inputs but different software and analysis. They couldnt get the operation to work.\n\nGiven the numbers of Ukrainian troops and available stockpiles of ammunition, the planners concluded that the Ukrainians would exhaust their combat power before achieving the offensives objectives.\n\n\"This was them asking for our advice,\" said a senior U.S. defense official, who like others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning. \"And our advice was, Hey, guys, youre going to bite off more than you can chew. This isnt going to work out well.\"\n\nBeyond the risk of running out of steam, a Zaporizhzhia offensive might have pushed Ukrainian forces into a pocket the Russians could surround with reinforcements sent along two axes, from Crimea and Russia.\n\n\"Our commanders thought the Ukrainians left pretty determined that they were going to do the whole thing anyway just that there was a lot of pressure to do the whole thing,\" the defense official said.\n\nThe White House reiterated the U.S. militarys analysis in talks with Zelenskys office.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan talked to the Ukrainian presidents chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, about the plans for a broad southern counteroffensive, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe Ukrainians accepted the advice and undertook a narrower campaign focused on Kherson city, which sits on the west side of the Dnieper River, separated from Russian-held territory to the east.\n\n\"I give the Ukrainians a lot of credit,\" the defense official said. \"They allowed reality to move them toward a more limited set of objectives in Kherson. And they were nimble enough to exploit an opportunity in the north. Thats a lot.\"\n\nKovalchuk set out to bisect the Russian-occupied area on the west side of the Dnieper and trap the Russian forces. \"My task was not only to liberate the territory,\" he said. \"My task from the start was to occlude and destroy the force. That is, to not let them leave or exist.\"\n\nThe objectives of the Kherson offensive were to bisect the Russian- occupied area west of the Dnieper River and trap the Kremlin forces there, and to get within artillery range of Kherson city and three key river crossings.

The 25,000 Russian troops in that portion of Kherson, separated by the broad river from their supplies, had been placed in a highly exposed position. If enough military pressure was applied, Moscow would have no choice but to retreat, Kovalchuk said.\n\nRussia had to arm and feed its forces via three crossings: the Antonovsky Bridge, the Antonovsky railway bridge and the Nova Kakhovka dam, part of a hydroelectric facility with a road running on top of it.\n\nThe two bridges were targeted with U.S.-supplied M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS launchers, which have a range of 50 miles and were quickly rendered impassable.\n\n\"There were moments when we turned off their supply lines completely, and they still managed to build crossings,\" Kovalchuk said. \"They managed to replenish ammunition. It was very difficult.\"\n\nKovalchuk considered flooding the river. The Ukrainians, he said, even conducted a test strike with a HIMARS launcher on one of the floodgates at the Nova Kakhovka dam, making three holes in the metal to see if the Dniepers water could be raised enough to stymie Russian crossings but not flood nearby villages.\n\nThe test was a success, Kovalchuk said, but the step remained a last resort. He held off.\n\nVII\n\nAt the outset of the Kherson offensive, Ukrainian forces charged through Russias first-line defenses. Then they met fierce resistance.\n\nA 32-year-old company commander named Yurii in Ukraines 35th Marine Brigade led his platoons in early September across a small river under fire, only to face a dug-in second line outside the village of Bruskynske, about 50 miles northeast of Kherson city. The Russians had been in the area for months, lining trenches with concrete and hiding tanks in deep ditches in the ground.\n\nThere, Yuriis men felt the full force of Russian aviation. Russian military aircraft dropped high-explosive FAB bombs on his unit, which initially didnt have any weaponry to defend itself or target the planes.\n\n\"This is a munition that leaves nothing behind,\" Yurii said. \"That explosion, that wave when its 200 meters away, you feel it very strongly. It throws you back. When we had direct hits on the positions with FABs, there was nothing left of the people.\"\n\nUkrainian forces in the area were trying to push southward to bisect the Russian-occupied territory west of the Dnieper and get within artillery range of the Nova Kakhovka dam.\n\nUkrainian losses quickly mounted. With increasing numbers of armored vehicles destroyed or out of service, medics had to use pickup trucks to shuttle the wounded, often under fire from the Russians. Later, they used a Russian-made car.\n\n\"During the next evacuation, my combat medic was hit by shrapnel through the window directly into the car,\" Yurii said. \"During those two weeks, there was not a single window left in the car. Everything was smashed by shrapnel. But still the evacuations took place.\"\n\nBy October, Ukraine had begun stabilizing the situation, and Yurii was dispatched to enter the nearby village of Davydiv Brid. There, he climbed a red metal structure, bursting with happiness, to record on camera that the village had been liberated.\n\nA strong wind gusted. \"We solemnly hang a blue-yellow flag above Davydiv Brid,\" he yelled into the gale. \"Glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nVIII\n\nBack in Kyiv, impatience was growing.\n\nKovalchuk was insisting it was just a matter of time before the Russians retreated the leaves were about to fall off the trees, the river would freeze in winter, the Russian forces were running low on supplies.\n\nBut for Kyiv, Kovalchuk wasnt moving fast enough. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. Oleksandr Tarnavsky, a deputy of Syrskys during the Kharkiv operation.\n\nA senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Kovalchuk \"wasnt getting the job done.\"\n\nBut the change wasnt publicly announced, the official said, so as not to provide Russia with any kind of propaganda victory. The Americans were informed.\n\n\"I think there were folks who were probably getting impatient with the movement in the south,\" said a senior U.S. military official. \"It was a really good start and then it just kind of stopped.\"\n\nTarnavsky, the new commander, said he applied some of the principles he and Syrsky had used in Kharkiv, attacking where the Russians least expected it.\n\nHe said he singled out the territory between Mykolaiv and Kherson flat farmland with few trees and obstructive concrete irrigation canals as the place to mount the main offensive drive. \"The calculation,\" Tarnavsky said, \"was the enemy wouldnt think we would do it there.\"\n\nIX\n\nResponsibility for that difficult stretch of front, northwest of Kherson, fell to Col. Vadym Sukharevsky, commander of the 59th Motorized Infantry Brigade.\n\nHis men had charged through Russias front lines, overcoming losses, and were pushing against ferocious resistance to get close enough to strike the river crossings into Kherson with artillery. That fire would also make Russian resupply trips by pontoon barges nearly impossible. His forces were almost there. \"It was literally a battle for every meter,\" Sukharevsky said.\n\nUp against elite Russian air-assault units, Sukharevskys less experienced troops were forced to engage in what he called battlefield \"folk art.\"\n\nThey modified the batteries in off-the-shelf DJI Mavic drones so the copters could fly four times farther, up to 13 miles. They obtained an additive used to give natural gas its scent and launched the foul odor into enemy trenches. They accepted drones from cigarette smugglers and transformed them into self-detonating explosives.\n\n\"Our army is used to fighting with improvised means,\" Sukharevsky said.\n\nOne of his platoon commanders, Chief Sgt. Yevhen Ignatenko, the owner of a large Kherson grain-shipping business and a regional politician, explained how best to destroy his own barges, which Russia had requisitioned to ferry forces and supplies across the Dnieper.\n\nIgnatenko drew on a lifetime of local knowledge back roads, canals, pumping stations to figure out how to advance through the difficult terrain. He also gathered information about the Russians activities from a network of sources behind enemy lines.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 9, Sukharevsky said, the brigade closed in on Zelenyi Hai, a village that put Kherson within artillery range. The Ukrainians began striking the river, he said. But the Russians had begun retreating days earlier.\n\nSukharevsky said he credits Ukraines victory partly to the artillery systems, guided munitions and long-range rocket launchers sent by the West, which eventually wore down a Russian force already low on ammunition and struggling with supply lines.\n\nThe pressure from Ukrainian troops forced the retreat, but they didnt manage to run down or destroy the fleeing Russians. Mines, in some cases laid a meter apart and three rows deep or tucked into thin strips on the roads, prevented the Ukrainians from giving chase.\n\n\"They didnt hold back,\" Sukharevsky said. \"They mined with everything, even new means we had never heard of.\"\n\nX\n\nWhen Zelensky visited Izyum in mid-September, days after Ukraines Kharkiv offensive, the officials with him were tense, even though he was still some 12 miles from the front line. A visit to Kherson, with Russian snipers just across the river, posed a much greater risk.\n\nZelensky, however, could not be kept away.\n\nTarnavsky stood beside Zelensky on Khersons central square. \"I was amazed at the people I saw,\" Tarnavsky said. \"All of their faces, there was just joy on them.\"\n\nZelensky raised the flag over a liberated city for the second time in two months and described the moment as the \"beginning of the end of the war.\"\n\nIgnatenko, the regional politician and Kherson shipping magnate serving in the 59th Brigade, sent a drone up over the river and found one of his barges half-submerged near the Antonovsky Bridge, but others were missing.\n\n\"Well find them,\" Ignatenko said. \"And if we dont find them, well build new ones. Its okay. At least we will be a free country.\"\n\nShane Harris in Washington and Mary Ilyushina in Riga, Latvia, contributed to this report.",

Credit Credit... Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times\n\nKYIV, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was returning to Ukraine on Thursday after a high-profile visit to Washington that was greeted at home with mostly pride and hope that his impassioned, in-person appeals would keep American weapons and financial support flowing.\n\nAmid the darkness and cold from Russian missile strikes that have knocked out power for millions of people as winter sets in and after weeks of stalemate along much of the front line the surprise presidential trip buoyed morale in Ukraine. Some Ukrainians said that they were cheered to see members of Congress chant during Mr. Zelenskys appearance the patriotic greeting, \"Glory to heroes!\"\n\n\"Friends, everything will be fine, Ukraine will be fine, we will be given everything, we will be helped,\" Valeriy Tryhub, a ski instructor, wrote in a post on Facebook.\n\nReached by telephone later, Mr. Tryhub said that he had stayed up until 2:30 a.m. to watch Mr. Zelenskys address to a joint session of Congress, where the Ukrainian president received standing ovations and presented Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag that had been signed by soldiers.\n\n\"This is, without exaggeration, an historical event,\" he said of Mr. Zelenskys visit, his first trip abroad since Russias invasion in February.\n\n\"We now, more than ever, need world support in the struggle for independence,\" Mr. Tryhub added. \"The United States is one of the many countries that finally realized that without foreign support, we cannot win. So we need help, especially since we have common values such as democracy and freedom.\"\n\nImage Mr. Zelensky speaking with President Biden in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Credit... Tom Brenner for The New York Times\n\nOn his way back from Washington, Mr. Zelensky landed on Thursday in Poland, where he said that he met with President Andrzej Duda. He was returning to Ukraine with at least one tangible gain: an additional $1.8 billion in military aid announced Wednesday including a Patriot missile battery, one of the most advanced air defense systems.\n\nBut passage in Congress of an omnibus spending bill, which includes an additional nearly $50 billion in funding for Ukraine, was delayed on Wednesday night because of an impasse over immigration policy.\n\nStill, it was a mostly triumphant visit, planned in stealth, for Mr. Zelensky, a former comedic actor who was elected in a landslide in 2019 but whose popularity was slumping before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. Mr. Zelensky remained in Kyiv even though the capital seemed about to fall, and most Ukrainians quickly set aside politics to rally around their president.\n\n\"My whole life, I never imagined the president of Ukraine would be addressing Congress,\" Tetiana Bisyk, a writer, tweeted on Thursday, adding: \"I am so proud to be Ukrainian.\"\n\nArtur Bilous, a political analyst, wrote on Facebook that while \"no Ukrainian president was ever greeted like this\" in Washington, Mr. Zelenskys trip would ultimately be gauged a success if it helps speed up the flow of weaponry.\n\n\"In particular, how quickly military aid will be delivered, first of all the Patriot air defense system,\" Mr. Bilous wrote.\n\nOverall, the reaction in Ukraine was one of pride and hope and continued defiance toward Russia.\n\n\"Putin, I hope you are watching this real time,\" Kira Rudik, a member of Ukraines Parliament, posted on Twitter, addressing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \"We. Will. Win.\"\n\nMaria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv.",

To kick things off, I just wanted to go over the ground rules really quickly. The contents of this call and everything we are about to discuss is under embargo until further notice.\n\nWhen we are able to lift the embargo, I will send everyone who RSVPd an email letting you know that the contents are now reportable. For planning purposes, we are not expecting that to be for at least several hours. Thank you again for your understanding, and we appreciate everyones flexibility.\n\nAs many of you may have guessed, tonights call is about President Zelenskyys visit to the White House tomorrow.\n\nFor your awareness and not for your reporting, our speaker tonight is [senior administration official].\n\n[Senior administration official], Ill turn it over to you for some opening remarks. And after that, Ill moderate the Q&A\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you, [moderator]. And thanks, everybody.\n\nIm glad to intrude on your evening with what I think is a pretty exciting piece of news, which is that at President Bidens invitation, President Zelenskyy will be visiting Washington, D.C., tomorrow and will have the opportunity to engage here at the White House and then go up to Capitol Hill. And in doing so, this visit will underscore the United States enduring commitment to Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden and President Zelenskyy discussed the visit of President Zelenskyy to Washington when they spoke on the phone on December 11th. And the White House formally invited President Zelenskyy to come tomorrow, Wednesday the 21st, last Wednesday the 14th. And in doing so, indicated that we wanted to host him for a program here at the White House that would involve an extended sit-down with President Biden, a meeting with key members of President Bidens national security team and Cabinet, an opportunity to address the press, and then an opportunity to go up to Capitol Hill to do a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe Ukrainian side President Zelenskyys office formally accepted the invitation last Friday. And then the visit was finally confirmed on Sunday, just three days ago, at which point the White House engaged with the Speakers office to notify them that President Zelenskyy would be traveling here and that they could work to coordinate together with the White House and President Zelenskyy the joint session that will be scheduled for tomorrow evening.\n\nWell have more details to share on the schedule soon. But again, just a quick overview: President Biden will first welcome President Zelenskyy at the White House for bilateral meetings. There will be the press conference and the opportunity to address members of the public. And then there will be an address by President Zelenskyy to a joint session of Congress demonstrating the strong bipartisan support for Ukraine. And then President Zelenskyy will return, after just a few short hours on the ground, to his people in Ukraine.\n\nWere looking forward to having President Zelenskyy back at the White House for his second visit but his first visit since the start of Russias brutal war against Ukraine. Its something weve wanted to do for some time. And tomorrow is actually the 300th day since Russia brutally invaded Ukraine in an all-out assault with the goal of wiping its neighbor off the map and subjecting the Ukrainian people to Russian dominion.\n\nRussia expected that this war would be quick work, that they would be in Kyiv and dominating the country within a matter of days. But here we are 300 days later, and Ukraine stands, Kyiv stands, the Ukrainian people stand. And Ukraine, in fact, has been pushing back against Russian aggression, reclaiming territory over the course of the past several weeks and months.\n\nOf course, in response to that, Russia has begun a barbaric campaign of attacking Ukraines critical infrastructure purposely destroying power, heat, and electricity in an attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people and cause human suffering. But Ukraines government and its people remain unbreakable, and theyve inspired the world with their resilience.\n\nIts been simply remarkable to watch how Ukraine, aided by U.S. support and the support of our allies and partners, has bravely defended its country, repelled Russian attacks, and retaken a significant amount of their territory.\n\nIn the meeting tomorrow, President Biden will have the opportunity with President Zelenskyy to have an in-depth strategic discussion on the way ahead on the battlefield; on the capabilities and training that the U.S. and our allies will continue to provide to Ukraine; on the sanctions and export controls that we have imposed and will continue to tighten and reinforce that have placed significant costs on Russias economy and Russias defense industrial base; and on the economic and energy sector assistance as well as the humanitarian assistance were providing to make life better for the people of Ukraine.\n\nOver the course of the past 300 days, President Biden has rallied the world to stand up for freedom and democracy and to stand with Ukraine as theyve defended themselves from Russias brutal war. Weve organized a coalition of more than 50 countries who are providing military assistance to help Ukraine defend its country. Weve provided economic assistance to make sure the Ukrainian government can keep providing basic services to the Ukrainian people. Weve provided humanitarian assistance to help support the millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes because of Putins war.\n\nAnd President Biden will have the opportunity to reinforce that this support is not just about what we have done before, but what we will do today and what we will continue to do for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, because Russia has shown no interest in being willing to end this brutal war, just as they were unwilling to engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to avert this conflict in the first place, we know that in the days ahead the conflict will continue, the winter will be hard, and we will continue day in, day out to provide critical support to the Ukrainian people.\n\nIn fact, tomorrow, President Biden will announce a significant new package of nearly $2 billion of security assistance for Ukraine. It will contain a very important new capability: a Patriot missile battery, which will be a critical asset to defend the Ukrainian people against Russias barbaric attacks on Ukraines critical infrastructure. We will train Ukrainian forces on how to operate the Patriot missile battery in a third country. This will take some time, but Ukrainian troops will take that training back to their country to operate this battery.\n\nAnd we will continue to prioritize other forms of air defense support as well, including NASAMS, HAWKs, Stingers, and counter-UAV equipment.\n\nOn the course of this visit, we will also have the opportunity, along with Congress, to mark the work to pass a significant package of additional funding for Ukraine for 2023. And we anticipate a bipartisan package of more than $40 billion of funding for Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden will continue to rally the world as we work to maintain the remarkable unity weve demonstrated over 2022. And as I said, he will reinforce the fundamental message on this trip to President Zelenskyy directly, to the Ukrainian people, the American people, and the world publicly that the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes and that in doing so, that support will remain broad, deep, and bipartisan.\n\nAnd with that, Id be happy to take your questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you so much, [senior administration official]. First, well go to Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press.\n\nQ Thanks, [senior administration official]. Could you talk a little bit about why now is an okay time for President Zelenskyy to leave Ukraine and visit, and if President Biden has any thoughts about visiting there soon?\n\nAnd then, secondly, how much of this visit is also about the President sending a message to the next Republican-led Congress about the need for the U.S. to keep the aid to Ukraine flowing as this war goes on, perhaps beyond even the next $45 billion that you hope to send? Thank you.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. With respect to the first question, of course theres no mathematical formula for the right day for President Zelenskyy to make his first trip out of the country. And, of course, I would defer to him to speak to his decision-making about why he felt this would be a good time.\n\nBut in his discussion with President Biden, what the two of them agreed upon was that having the opportunity for them to sit down together and for President Zelenskyy to be able to come to the United States to thank the American people for the incredible support that theyve received and to thank both parties, to thank the bipartisan support that hes received would be an important injection of momentum and sustenance to American and Allied support for the months ahead and for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd so, as the year draws to a close, as we head deeper into winter, as we continue to provide Ukraine the capabilities it needs on the battlefield, as we continue to surge diplomatic support and solidarity to Ukraine, this moment felt like a good opportunity for them to be able to have this engagement this personal face-to-face engagement and for President Zelenskyy to have this opportunity to address the American people.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy has indicated hes very keen was very keen to make his first visit to the United States to be able to send this message.\n\nBut again, Ill I wont say more than that and let him speak for himself.\n\nIn terms of the question of the timing as it relates to the new Congress, Ive said before and Ill reiterate here, as many others here at the White House have, that we have been confident all along that despite some rumors and suggestions to the contrary, support for Ukraine would remain broad, deep, and bipartisan. I think the vote that you will see on this substantial aid package demonstrates that, and I think the support you will see for President Zelenskyy at the joint session tomorrow demonstrates that as well.\n\nSo, this isnt about sending a message to a particular political party. This is about sending a message to Putin and sending a message to the world that America will be there for Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd President Putin badly miscalculated the beginning of this conflict when he presumed that the Ukrainian people would yield and that NATO would be disunited. He was wrong on both those counts; he remains wrong about our staying power. And thats what this visit will demonstrate.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you. And then, just because Ive gotten a few emails of people asking about the embargo because they joined late, I just want to remind everyone that the contents of this call are under embargo until further notice. When were able to lift the embargo, I will send to everyone who RSVPd an email letting you know that the contents are now reportable. And just for your planning purposes, we are not expecting that to be for at least several hours.\n\nWith that, well go to our next question, which is Steve Holland from Reuters.\n\nQ Hey. Thank you. [Senior administration official], will the President feel Zelenskyy out on the possibility for a diplomatic end to the war?\n\nAnd secondly, what are you expecting the war to stretch well into the new year? What whats your anticipation on that front?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On the second question, Russia could, of course, end the war tomorrow by pulling out of Ukraine. They show no intention of doing so and no intention of seriously sitting down to commit to doing so. So, we do not see diplomacy that would lead to an end to the war on just terms as being on the very near-term horizon.\n\nPresident Biden has been absolutely clear from the start, even before the start of this war, that his principle is \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\"; that he is not going to pressure or push Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, but rather, he is going to work with Congress and with our allies to put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield so that when the time is ripe, they are in the best possible position at the negotiating table.\n\nAnd they will discuss every element of this conflict, including the situation on the battlefield and including the question of where the war goes from here. And I wont say more than that today because I think its very important for them to have the opportunity to discuss it.\n\nBut what I will reinforce is that the President is not coming with a message that is about pushing or prodding or poking Zelenskyy in any way. This is going to be a message of solidarity and support, coordination and alignment, and making sure that we are very much putting Ukraine in the best possible position to defend its interests and secure its objectives.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question, well go to Asma Khalid from NPR.\n\nQ Hi there. Thanks. Can you all hear me?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, we can.\n\nQ Hi. [Senior administration official], could you speak at all to the risk assessment in Zelenskyy flying here at this particular moment and your confidence that, presumably, Russia will not take drastic actions while he is out of the country?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, Russia has been taking drastic action on a near daily basis in Ukraine, trying to plunge the entire country into cold and dark as we head into the dead of winter rolling over towns and villages, wantonly killing civilians, bombing hospitals, maternity wards, you name it. And I think we can expect the same in the days ahead.\n\nSo Russia has shown no signs of abating its widespread and barbaric attacks against Ukrainian cities and towns, Ukrainian civilians, Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\nWe had the opportunity to consult closely with President Zelenskyy on the security parameters of him being able to depart the country, come to the United States for a brief period, and return.\n\nOf course, it ultimately was his decision to make. He concluded that those security parameters were you know, met what he needed. We agreed with that, and so we are executing accordingly.\n\nAnd, you know, Russia will continue to do what Russia does, and we will continue to do what we do, and that is to not be deterred from our support for Ukraine and for us and Zelenskyy to not be deterred to travel as he sees fit to advance his peoples interests and his countrys interests.\n\nAnd I would point out that, just this morning, he traveled to the town of Bakhmut in the east, which is very close to the frontlines in the east. He has previously traveled to other areas right out there on the frontlines. And he makes his own determinations about that travel based on what he believes is best going to deliver for his people.\n\nHe made the same calculus when it comes to coming to the United States. He feels this is something that is going to aid the fight for Ukraine. And we are determined to ensure that it aids the fight in Ukraine by projecting a strong message of unity and resolve from the White House, from Washington, from the free world, on behalf of all of the nations supporting Ukraine. Thats what we intend to do tomorrow.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question, well go to Peter Alexander with NBC News.\n\nQ I appreciate you hosting this, [senior administration official]. If you could walk us through a little bit of the timetable of what we should anticipate tomorrow acknowledging this will come out as part of the embargo: when youre hoping this will happen over the course of the day; when the joint address would take place; anyone with whom hes traveling tomorrow. Is the First Lady of Ukraine traveling with him or any other key individuals?\n\nAnd in terms of his travel here, is the U.S. is he traveling in any form with U.S. transport? Appreciate any more details as to the specific timeline relates to tomorrows\n\nplans.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Peter, great questions all. Im going to defer the delegation question to the Ukrainians, and they will speak to that when they come out.\n\nOn timing, I will what I will say is that this is going to be afternoon into evening, is what we anticipate. But Im not going to say anything further than that.\n\nAnd then on the rest of the questions around the details of what youre looking for, we will try to get you that information tomorrow once hes here. But Im at this point, Im not at liberty to share.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And, Peter, and for everyone out there, we will have an email updated email late tonight with some updated daily guidance for everyone with timing as well. So youll be able to go into tomorrow morning knowing exactly the timing.\n\nFor our next question, well go to Michael Shear from the New York Times.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hey, [senior administration official]. Thanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit to the message that the President President Biden wants to send to the American people with this visit. Hes obviously been hes obviously been very direct about the fact that, from a timing standpoint, theres no you know, hes going to stick with this for \"as long as it takes,\" I think is what he said. But hes also, in the past and certainly at the beginning, put limits on U.S. participation in the war in Ukraine no boots on the ground and the like.\n\nIs there any is there any sense in which this should suggest to the American people that that those kinds of limits are changing and that he might tell Zelenskyy that the U.S. is willing to be more deeply involved than he had, sort of, suggested to the American people in the past?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No. The President has been very clear from the beginning. He hasnt wavered from and he wont waver from it tomorrow, or next month or next year, that the United States is not sending forces to Ukraine to directly fight the Russians. What we are sending instead is billions now, tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment and supplies, sophisticated weaponry to help Ukrainians defend themselves.\n\nAnd I noted with respect to his announcement on the Patriot battery tomorrow as to that, we will train Ukrainians in a third country to operate that battery. Once trained, they will go in with the battery to man it in Ukraine; it wont be U.S. personnel who are doing that. And nothing will change in that regard.\n\nThe President has been very clear that we are going to lean forward and be robust in our support for Ukraine on the military, economic, energy, and humanitarian fronts, but we are not seeking to engage in a direct war with Russia. And nothing about that will change tomorrow.\n\nWhat tomorrow is about is an opportunity to reinforce to the American people that thanks chiefly to the bravery of the Ukrainian people, but also thanks to the support that the American people have provided, Kyiv stands, Kharkiv stands, Kherson stands as proud Ukrainian cities that have resisted Russian conquest, and that Ukraine as a nation is standing proud and tall and pushing back against Russian aggression. And what we are doing to help support Ukraine is helping to secure these victories.\n\nAnd he is going to reinforce that the key now for us to demonstrate, not just through words but through resources and through the support we are actively giving, is that we will stand by Ukraine, stand with Ukraine for as the question said, as Ive said, as President has said as long as it takes.\n\nSo this is a message of resolve. Its a message of conviction that we are doing the right thing here. And its a message of support for the President of Ukraine and his people at this critical hour, at this moment as we head deeper into winter, where they deserve to know that America is standing with them, and they deserve to know that the world is standing with them.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you. And I believe [senior administration official] has to run, so I just want to say thank you, everyone, for joining this call on short notice. And thank you, [senior administration official], for taking the time.\n\nAs a reminder of the parameters of this call, it was held on background, attributable to a \"senior administration official.\"\n\nAgain, I will email everyone who RSVPd with a note letting you know when the embargo is lifted and the contents of this call will be reportable. For your planning purposes, again, I would not expect that for at least several hours, but well keep everyone posted.\n\nIm more than happy to answer any other logistical questions that anyone has offline.\n\nAgain, we will be sending out a daily guidance email the White House press team will be late tonight. So everyone will be able to wake up tomorrow morning knowing exactly what time they should expect what.\n\nWith that, thank you again for joining the call tonight, and I appreciate your flexibility and understanding.\n\n7:02 P.M.

                "cc_text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky called on Ukrainians to have \"patience and faith\" in a defiant Christmas address after a deadly wave of Russian strikes pounded the southern city of Kherson.\n\nTen months into Russias war on Ukraine, Zelensky spoke of endurance and pushing through to the end, while acknowledging that \"freedom comes at a high price.\"\n\nHe urged the nation to stand firm in the face of a grim winter of energy blackouts, the absence of loved ones and the ever-present threat of Russian attacks.\n\nZelenskys message came after Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched deadly rocket strikes into downtown Kherson on Christmas Eve, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens. Zelensky described those attacks as \"killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.\"\n\nA rescuer extinguishes a fire in a burning shop after Russian shelling on the city of Kherson on December 24, 2022. Dimitar Kilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWe will find each other\n\nIn his Christmas message, Zelensky acknowledged that all holidays have a bitter aftertaste for the besieged country this year.\n\n\"We can feel the traditional Spirit of Christmas differently. Dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm.\n\n\"There may be empty chairs around it. And our houses and streets cant be so bright. And Christmas bells can ring not so loudly and inspiringly. Through air raid sirens, or even worse gunshots and explosions.\"\n\nHe said that Ukraine had been resisting evil forces for three hundred days and eight years, however, \"in this battle, we have another powerful and effective weapon. The hammer and sword of our spirit and consciousness. The wisdom of God. Courage and bravery. Virtues that incline us to do good and overcome evil.\"\n\nAddressing the Ukrainian people directly, he said the country would sing Christmas carols louder than the sound of a power generator and hear the voices and greetings of relatives \"in our hearts\" even if communication services and the internet are down.\n\n\"And even in total darkness we will find each other to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will give a big hug to warm each other.\"\n\nZelensky concluded: \"We will celebrate our holidays! As always. We will smile and be happy. As always. The difference is one. We will not wait for a miracle. After all, we create it ourselves.\"\n\nUkraine has traditionally celebrated Christmas on January 7 in line with Orthodox Christian customs, which acknowledge the birth of Jesus according to the Julian calendar.\n\nBut a yearslong rift between the Ukrainian and Russian branches of the Orthodox church has widened since Moscows invasion in February.\n\nOne branch of Ukraines Orthodox church announced last month that it would allow its churches to celebrate Christmas on December 25. And many younger Ukrainians are now choosing to observe the holiday on December 25 in a bid to move away from Russia and towards the Western world.\n\nOn Sunday evening, a few dozen people gathered around a darkened Christmas tree in Kyivs Sophia Square, in the center of the Ukrainian capital, and broke out in applause when the generator kicked in and the trees blue and yellow lights switched on.\n\nIhor Zholudiev, an IT specialist originally from Ukraines second largest city, Kharkiv, told CNN that he found the moment \"inspiring.\"\n\n\"This Christmas is special for us, because we can celebrate it in this difficult year,\" Zholudiev said. His wishes for Christmas, the new year and his birthday are the same: \"victory and peaceful sky above our heads.\n\nOlena Vedmid, a photographer, described cobbling together dinner with her family amid the frequent power outages in the capital.\n\n\"We had electricity for half a day, so we had time to cook the dishes,\" she said. \"This year we celebrated by candlelight and it was great. Everyone liked it, because it was cozy and sincere.\"\n\nA Ukrainian couple pictured in Kyiv's Sophia Square on Christmas Day in the Ukrainian capital. Svitlana Vlasova/CNN\n\nKherson strikes\n\nHours before Zelensky delivered his Christmas address, a series of deadly Russian strikes slammed into the city of Kherson, where apartments and medical facilities were among the buildings hit, according to Yaroslav Yanushevych, head of the regions military administration.\n\nYanushevych said Sunday that a total of 16 people had been killed in 71 Russian attacks across the wider Kherson region on Saturday, including three state emergency workers who were killed during demining operations. Another 64 people received injuries of varying severity, he said.\n\nZelensky condemned the shelling of Kherson as an act of \"terror.\"\n\nZelensky condemned the shelling as an act of \"terror.\" Dimitar Kilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The terrorist country continues bringing the Russian world in the form of shelling of the civilian population. Kherson. In the morning, on Saturday, on the eve of Christmas, in the central part of the city,\" he said.\n\n\"These are not military facilities,\" he wrote on Telegram Saturday. \"This is not a war according to the rules defined. It is terror, it is killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.\"\n\nIn November, Russias military retreated from Kherson city, the only regional capital it had captured since the invasion began, in a major setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, Russian forces have stationed themselves across the river from Kherson and regularly shell the city from there.\n\nPutin says he is ready to negotiate with everyone involved\n\nPutin said he is ready to \"negotiate with everyone involved in this process about acceptable solutions,\" regarding the war in Ukraine, according to Russian state news agency TASS, citing Putins interview with state TV Sunday.\n\n\"I dont think it is so dangerous, I think we are moving in the right direction, protecting our national interests and the interests of our citizens, our people. And we simply have no other choice but to protect our citizens,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved in this process about acceptable solutions, but its up to them. Its not us who is refusing to negotiate, its them.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted in response saying \"Putin needs to come back to reality.\"\n\nPodolyak tweeted that Russia \"single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens\" and that \"Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility. This is obvious, so we are moving to the Tribunal.\"\n\nPutins remarks come as Russia continues its offensive against Ukraine. On Sunday Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said Russian troops hit Kramatorsk with three rockets. An industrial area was hit but there were no casualties.",

Such a move by Belarus might also further strain international relations, as it would signify support for the use of force as a foreign policy tool, which could undermine the rules-based international order and have implications for global security (2). The actions of Belarus, acting as a launchpad for the Russian invasion, have already damaged relations between Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, and further involvement could exacerbate these tensions and the long-term consequences for regional stability (3,5). The uncertainty surrounding the intentions of Belarus's leadership adds to the precariousness of the situation, with the potential to further destabilize an already tense security environment in Eastern Europe and beyond (4).",

This could also send a negative message globally, undermining the notion that force is not a viable foreign policy tool and weakening the rules-based international order (1,2,7). Belarusian involvement might also raise the stakes for neighboring countries, increasing the likelihood of a broader regional conflict that could destabilize areas such as the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and even regions as far as Central Asia and Africa (2,7).\n\nMoreover, direct Belarusian participation in the conflict could have long-lasting consequences on the relationships between Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Russians, poisoning ties for generations (5). It could also potentially open up opportunities for post-conflict reconstruction and alignment with Western institutions for countries like Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova, but this hinges on a Ukrainian victory and the end of aggressive actions by neighboring states. A more involved Belarus could also signal a shift towards a more assertive Russian stance in the region, increasing the risks of interdicting supply lines from NATO member countries and threatening the security of the entire region (6,7,8)."

President Putin's visit to Belarus and his discussions with President Lukashenko underscored their commitment to continue military collaboration, developing and exchanging military equipment and weapons, as a means to ensure the safety of their countries amidst the ongoing conflict (1,3). Despite the deepened military ties and Belarus' role in facilitating Russian military actions, President Lukashenko has maintained that Belarusian troops will not directly engage in the Ukraine war, reflecting domestic unpopularity for such involvement (2,5). Additionally, the Kremlin is using this cooperation to project an image of a unified and competent military command structure, possibly to offset criticism from pro-war factions within Russia (4).",
                "more_detailed": "The recent military cooperation between Russia and Belarus, including joint military exercises and the establishment of a joint military unit, is a direct response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the perceived threats along the outer borders of their Union state. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have emphasized the protection of their countries' safety, with Putin visiting Minsk to discuss the continued collaboration in the military sphere, as well as the development and exchange of military equipment and weapons (1,3). This cooperation is taking place amid heightened tensions, as Belarus has allowed Russian troops to use its territory for launching attacks, despite Lukashenko asserting that Belarusian troops will not enter the war (2,5,6).\n\nThe intensification of military activities and strategic discussions between the two leaders suggests a coordinated response to the conflict in Ukraine. While Lukashenko has maintained that Belarus will not join the war, his country's support in providing a launching pad for Russian troops has been crucial. The meeting between Putin and Lukashenko, along with the deployment of Russian warplanes to Belarus, signals a strengthening military alliance. Moreover, Belarus's reliance on Russian support following contested elections and the subsequent protests has contributed to the deepening of military ties between the two nations. Accordingly, the ongoing partnership serves as a means to counterbalance international isolation and criticism of the Russian MoD, and to project a unified front against perceived external pressures (4,5,7,8)."

The presence of Russian forces in Belarus has been instrumental for launching operations against Ukraine, including the initial invasion in February 2022 from Belarusian territory, and the ongoing use of Belarus as a base for missile strikes and training of Russian troops (3,5,9). Belarus's participation in the conflict, whether by hosting Russian forces or potentially contributing its own troops, could force Ukraine to allocate resources to its northern border, thereby weakening its defenses against Russian assaults in other regions (1,7).\n\nThe strategic use of Belarusian territory by Russian forces has implications beyond military maneuvers. It serves as a pressure point on Ukraine, creating a multi-front challenge that could limit Ukraine's ability to concentrate forces in key areas such as the Donbas, southern Ukraine, and Crimea (7). Additionally, Belarus's involvement has broader geopolitical repercussions, potentially signaling Russia's intent to assert greater control over Belarus, transforming it into a vassal state (3). This could destabilize the region further and possibly escalate the war, drawing in other countries and exacerbating the already severe humanitarian and economic impacts of the conflict, such as increased fuel prices and the threat of food shortages (2,8,10)."

Furthermore, Belarus has allowed Russian forces to conduct military exercises within its borders and has been a launchpad for missile strikes against Ukraine (5,6,7).\n\nThe evolving role of Belarus in the conflict, however, remains uncertain. While Lukashenko has maintained that Belarusian troops will not join Russia's \"special military operation,\" the presence of Russian troops and military exercises in Belarus keeps the prospect of greater involvement open. Ukrainian intelligence has also reported seeing Belarusian soldiers alongside Russian forces after the invasion began, indicating a level of cooperation beyond what the Belarusian leadership publicly acknowledges (7,8). Moreover, Russia's provision of S-400 air missile defense systems to Belarus and the two countries' discussions of strategic partnerships suggest a deepening military alliance that could influence Belarus's role in the protracted conflict (6,9)."

Speaking at a news conference with his Belarus counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said, \"Russia and Belarus are working together to overcome the illegitimate steps and sanctions against Russia and Belarus,\" and were \"working with great confidence in this direction.\" Putin added: \"Our countries are closest allies and strategic partners.\" He said there wasjoint defense planning between Russia and Belarus and that Russia \"will do everything for the joint safety of our countries.\" \"Such measures are necessary because of the tense situation on the outer borders of the Union state,\" he said an apparent reference to the conflict in Ukraine and possibly the fractious relationship of both countries with Poland. Putin confirmed that Russia was currently conducting military exercises on the territory of Belarus and that Russia and Belarus were also jointly developing weaponry. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier Monday, that\"The final assessment of the combat capability and combat readiness of the units will be given by the command at the final stage of coordination after the battalion tactical exercises have been conducted.' Russian-Belarusian relations: Russian forces have been based in Belarus for much of the year. In October, the Belarus defense ministry said that 9,000 Russian troops were moving to the country as part of a \"regional grouping\" of forces to protect its borders. Russian combat aircraft are stationed at or frequently visit several Belarus air bases. Some of the recent cruise missile attacks on Ukraine have originated in Belarus, according to Ukrainian officials. Putin said that Russia remains the largest investor in Belarus, to the tune of some $4 billion. For his part, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said that 2022 had been a record for Russian-Belarusian relations on all levels and claimed that \"sanctions had a painful boomerang effect on their initiators.\" The European Union and the United States have imposed a range of sanctions on Belarus, principally against senior officials of Lukashenko's government as well as air travel and some exports. \"Because the collective West has reared its ugly head at us, we must coordinate our efforts,\" Lukashenko said.",

                "cc_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare trip to Belarus on Monday to meet with the country's president, close regional ally Aleksandr Lukashenko, who backed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and is under increasing pressure to provide more support to the war effort. In a statement after their talks in Minsk, the pair said they had agreed to continue joint military exercises and cooperate closely in the military sphere, exchanging and developing equipment and weapons, to protect \"the safety of our countries,\"without putting a fine point on what that would look like. Putin added that \"such measures are necessary\" because of the tense situation \"on the outer borders of the Union state [of Russia and Belarus].\" But neither leader mentioned Ukraine in their public statements. Both emphasized the challenges of Western economic sanctions pressure, underlining the need to support each other. Putin said he expected trade between the two countries to reach a record this year, at the equivalent of $40 billion. Lukashenko said that, despite \"some rough edges,\" Belarus and Russia would find answers to all threats; and expressed the hope that the West will \"listen to the voice of reason\" so a dialogue on security could resume. Some background: Lukashenkoallowed Putin to use Belarus, which shares a 674-mile border with Ukraine, as a staging ground for his invasion. In early February, Russia sent some 30,000 troops ostensibly forjoint military exerciseswith Belarus the biggest deployment to the former Soviet state since the end of the Cold War. Weeks later, whenPutin declared his \"special military operation\"on February 24, he sent missiles, paratroopers and a huge armored column of soldiers rolling south from Belarusian soil. Unraveling the role that Belarushas played in the Ukraine war has taken on new urgency since Lukashenko announced in October that Russian soldiers would deploy to the country to form a new, \"regional grouping\" and carry out new joint exercises with Belarusian troops, raising fears that he might draw the countrymore directly into the conflict. Putin has been laying the groundwork to transform Belarus into a vassal state for some time. After a rigged presidential election in 2020 cemented Lukashenko's long reign, triggeringwidespread pro-democracy protests, he clung to power with the help of Putin. Russia backed theruthless crackdownon demonstrations, and gave Belarus a $1.5 billion lifeline to evade the brunt of sanctions, but it came with strings attached. Beholden to the Kremlin, Lukashenko has supported Russia's military actions from the sidelines, so far avoiding sending his own troops into the fray. But he may be forced to shift his position, asPutin racks up losses.",

                "cc_text": "Credit: Black Salmon / Shutterstock. The fintech industry is heading into 2023 with a lot of baggage.\n\nFintech is hurtling into 2023 along a rocky road. 2022 tormented the industry with a rock slide of setbacks such as crashing valuations, the cold harsh winds of the cryptocurrency winter, funding free-falling to worse-than pre-pandemic levels, regulators rushing to introduce more red tape to cut through, and companies collapsing at a catastrophic rate. Financial services innovators are seemingly standing on shaky ground.\n\nThe situation is dramatically different from how 2021 ended. As fintech firms found themselves heading into 2022, they were coming out of an all-time high. Covid-19 had set off a bull market. Stocks skyrocketed, investment flooded in and bitcoin was trading at an all-time high. Businesses eagerly met the new year with anticipation, hiring en-masse to meet projected record demands for their services. However, the first few months of 2022 swiftly dissuaded them of any delusions that those dreams were anything but fantasies.\n\nTheir victory lap has become a painful marathon. One of the first signs that a weather change was coming originated with the Federal Reserve. When the US central bank hinted at the beginning of the year that it would start to raise interest rates and indicated a dialling back of its aggressive bond-buying programme, it flagged to the market that it was expecting a downturn.\n\nRussias invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the situation. The illegal invasion raised fuel prices. It also threatened to cause a worldwide food shortage and spill over into other nations either via fighting on the ground or on the internet saying nothing about the risk of human suffering and deaths.\n\nFintech funding falling\n\nThese factors and others had palpable consequences. Investors responded by becoming more cautious. Fintech firms found that funding started to dry up as a result.\n\nOver the course of 2022, cash injections into the fintech industry have plummeted to below pre-Covid-19 levels. Back in 2016, investors put $79.7bn into the fintech industry across 1,697 venture financing, equity offering, private equity and debt offering deals, according to data accessed from research firm GlobalData on December 9.\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

In 2021, backers invested $261.7bn across 2,923 deals. However, funding has dried out in 2022. As the year is coming to a close, financial services innovators have only secured $81.4bn in new capital across 1,798 deals, according to GlobalData.\n\nDeals dropping weren't the only challenge the industry had to deal with. Rising inflation also meant people had less money to spend. Consequently, they didn't use fintech companies' services to the same extent as they had over the course of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nFalling funding and demand meant fintech firms had less money. The resulting bloodbath has been brutal. Just like the overall tech sector, financial services innovators have been forced to lay off staff, close overseas operations or collapsed all together in some cases like with cryptocurrency exchange FTX, due to to scandals and public scrutiny exposing how weak their business models really were.\n\nIt is against that backdrop that the fintech industry is heading into 2023. However, when Verdict reached out to 50 experts from around the fintech community to hear their insights and predictions for the new year, they responded with cautious bullishness.\n\nThe experts include representatives from tech giants like IBM, payment paragons like AliPay and a range of founders behind some of the most innovative fintech startups out there as well as the investors backing them.\n\nTo understand their confidence, it's worth remembering how widespread the fintech industry actually is.\n\nThe fintech industry will start 2023 on a rocky foundation\n\nThe fintech industry is a sprawling network where each segment caters to one specific user need. You have neobanks, banking as a service (BaaS) startups, embedded finance ventures, buy-now-pay later (BNPL) enterprises, regulation technology (regtech) businesses, open banking firms, cryptocurrency companies, insurance innovators and a plethora of other players each catering to a particular need.\n\nHowever, separate as they may seem at a glance, they have all been affected the different trends that have swept across the industry in 2022.\n\nGoing into 2023, fintech firms will continue to have to look over their shoulders as both Big Tech firms and financial services giants are moving into their turf.\n\nThen there's the regulatory rallying call for tougher policing of different aspects of the fintech sector in order to better protect users.\n\nThere have been plenty of setbacks in 2023 as well. The collapse of cryptocurrency giants like FTX, BlockFi and Celsius have rocked the confidence of bitcoin-based businesses. Despite this, several of the fintech experts we spoke to not only believed cryptocurrencies will continue to flourish, but also that we will see an emergence of more central bank digital currencies (CBDC) projects in 2023.\n\nThen there's the question of how new technology trends such as the metaverse, Web3 and the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution will transform the industry.\n\nDespite the challenges on the horizon, executives at German neobank N26 and payment giant Alipay seemingly share a sense of optimism about where the fintech industry will go in 2023\n\nSome, like Saxo Bank founder Lars Seier Christensen, believe the implosion of companies like Fast will be good for the fintech industry in the long run. They believe it will ensure the companies in that survive will be more resiliant, meaning the sector will be stronger as a result.\n\nSo, with all of that in mind, let's find out why the 50 fintech industry stakeholders we've spoken to believe Web3 will become a dirty word, ponder about the role of the metaverse, worry about the role of deepfakes, celebrate the growing use of AI, and predict where money will got next, as well as what else they think will happen to the sector in 2023.\n\nMagnus Larsson, CEO and founder, MAJORITY\n\n2023 will be the death of many specialised neobanks. Looking at the initial wave of neobanks, the majority have become country-specific bank challengers such as Chime in the US, Monzo in the UK, Lunar in the Nordic countries and N26 in Germany.\n\nA second wave of more verticalised neobanks have emerged. This includes Greenlight and Step for kids and teenagers, Current for the LGBTQ+ community, Kinly and Greenwood for African-Americans, SABEResPODER and Fortu for Hispanics and MAJORITY as an immigrant-focused banking subscription with various international resources.\n\nThis year, the financing situation has changed drastically. Valuations have dropped significantly, especially in the fintech space, with a general negative sentiment towards fintechs and many of them losing up to 80% of their valuations. We are now seeing many neobanks have had to scale down or close; in the last few weeks we saw Stilt closing shop, and that trend will continue next year.\n\nThe question is how will the future emerge? Banking is for sure a massive market and there will likely be a number of winners, but in order to survive, I believe there are a few things that you can't cheat. You have to have a real customer problem to solve; you need a target group that is big enough to build a large business; you must have a revenue and margin model that works; and you need to have a customer acquisition strategy that isn't built on spending all your money on Meta and Google.\n\nThe winners will be more obvious next year, as investments will mainly go to the companies that can show the above and prove to be relevant through turbulent times.\n\nAlexander Weber, chief growth officer, N26\n\nMore than ever before the outlook for fintech in 2023 will be dictated by external factors and ongoing economic uncertainty. In this context, the resilience of each companys business model will be decisive; propositions with diverse revenue streams will be better positioned to absorb external shocks and to thrive.\n\nBanks played a large role in the 2008 Financial Crisis. Since then, and off the back of that, the space and its regulators have evolved substantially. N26, like many other financial technology companies, was born in the aftermath of this crisis to make things better.\n\nNow, there is an opportunity and a requirement for neobanks to make good on this promise. In difficult times, they need to do everything they can to be a true financial partner, empowering consumers to stay on top of their finances and develop a positive relationship with their money.\n\nBut even with the overlapping crises we will likely experience in 2023, fintechs will still remain masters of their own destiny. To succeed, they must keep up the pace of innovation in spite of current headwinds. Customers needs are constantly evolving, and this is particularly true in times of crisis. So, I expect to see greater personalisation in both product and pricing in 2023 to reflect this.\n\nTechnology will continue to play an important role in breaking down barriers by making pricing more transparent, facilitating easier access to financial services, and promoting financial literacy.\n\nLily Shaw, investor, OMERS Ventures\n\nAfter a year where use cases and utility were viewed as deeply unsexy, I expect these to be the focus for 2023. We continue to see unmet need within both B2B and cross border payments, which we anticipate will remain growth markets.\n\nFor example, were starting to see great teams building Orchestration 2.0 within payments, which has the potential to massively improve gross margin profiles through meaningful economies of scale. For instance, companies are moving away from positioning themselves as a tech player, to being the merchant of record and in the flow of funds. The team at Paytrix is a great example of one company pioneering this approach.\n\nPietro Candela, European head of business development, Alipay+\n\nThe big innovation trend were seeing at the moment is service integration; moving beyond technologies that are fragmented in terms of their payment capabilities and additional services. This is particularly the case for cross-border payments, whereby businesses should be looking to providers that do more than just facilitate this one element.\n\nCross-border payment acceptance should be the minimum functionality particularly when looking to tap into the Asian market. Instead, businesses should be looking to technologies that allow customers to complete a transaction inside an app, instead of on a plastic card or NFC touchpoint, thus allowing users to enjoy an augmented experience before, during and after their payment. Further, it's possible to get geo-localised promotions in real-time, verify the forex rate of a cross-border payment before the transaction, as well as experience a much more seamless end-to-end journey.\n\nUltimately, this kind of mobile-first strategy will be crucial in creating seamless, and connected experiences for new markets, with the payment serving as just the first touchpoint.\n\nOliver Yonchev, co-founder and CEO, Flight Story\n\nIn the fintech space, we are going to see regulation, consolidation, clarity and AI be areas of focus in 2023.\n\nRegulation. Following the FTX saga and crypto crash of 22, we can expect to see companies, including both crypto and DeFi protocols, go through a serious regulatory overhaul. Some more mature DeFi and crypto companies will have already begun this process, but the organisations which are in their infancy or scaling up will be forced to comply or face becoming insolvent. These regulatory processes will extend into a standard of communication and marketing practices for DeFi and crypto assets and services, to protect both business and the market as a whole.\n\nConsolidation. As a result of the macro-environment, we can expect to see a number of companies struggle in the year to come. This will mean there will be an increase in M&A to strengthen the position of larger companies. This will go in-hand with current day Web2 fintech powerhouses looking to expand their Web3 capabilities and product offering for example, Stripes recent move into the crypto space. Businesses such as trading platforms and brokerages will start to diversify their platform capabilities to compete in de-centralised, saturated spaces, by adding value with new features, insights and content which drive community.\n\nWith many new terms circulating the fintech space this year, some will begin to embody a negative connotation ie, Web3 will become a dirty word. Instead of pushing for the tech community to become mainstream, we will see the return of the internet and internet applications which will demystify and remove barriers which currently surround new digital technologies.\n\nAI will play an increasingly important role in finance. For instance, we will start to see trading intelligence being implemented as a way to support retail investors. We will also spot further personalised and automated solutions in consumer banking products, and will see more context-based customer experiences through personalisation, powered by AI [and machine learning] tech.\n\nLili Metodieva, managing director, Monneo\n\nIt was probably long overdue, but after years of causing disruption within other sectors the world of fintech was disrupted itself in 2022.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, a downturn in investment capital into the sector was a huge source of concern. Thankfully, as the months have progressed the situation has begun to get a little better. However, I still dont feel like things are totally back to normal.\n\nTherefore, as we move into the new year, I predict we will see continued uncertainty across the fintech sector. Its only anecdotal evidence, but very few of the businesses that I speak to seem to be excited for the coming year, which may suggest they are anticipating another tough 12 months. Its easy to see why, businesses face several challenges right now, all of which seem destined to run into 2023, and possibly beyond.\n\nHowever, there are certainly things to be excited about. The growth of ecommerce sales in recent times have been nothing short of staggering, and I see no reason why they wont continue into 2023.\n\nIn the last two years, ecommerce sales rose from 15% of total retail sales to 21%. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict the market has room to grow, expecting the sector to rise from its valuation of $3.3tn today, to over $5.4tn by 2026.\n\nMake no mistake, this is also great news for fintech businesses. In the next few years, as online merchants receive and send more money from acquirers, suppliers, and partners, the need for truly frictionless financial solutions will become increasingly necessary. Thankfully, the fintech community can satisfy this need, with several incredibly relevant solutions already available, which will become more popular in 2023 such as Monneo.\n\nFrancesco Simoneschi, co-founder and CEO, TrueLayer\n\nIn 2023, it will become easier to pay in crypto, with more businesses supporting it as a payment method. To reflect this, we will see more and better crypto-fiat on ramp solutions making it easier for end customers to transact this way, with Stripe having very recently launched their offer in this space.\n\nAI will continue to drive speed and optimisation in fintech and banking, with greater practical adoption in areas such as chatbots and customer service functions.\n\nI expect to see more open finance use cases coming to market, using the power of open banking alongside a wider range of data sources. This will enable new partnerships to flourish, for example in variable recurring payments, which allow consumers to make regular payments for a product, service or bill, but in a much more frictionless and transparent way than was previously possible, using the technology that underpins open banking.\n\nIntersecting with all these trends, embedded finance will mean that it will become easier for a far wider variety of non-financial businesses to offer financial services, and to set up their own offers in areas like BNPL.\n\nBenjamin Chemla, co-founder and CEO, Shares\n\nOver the last year, weve seen many banking and investment apps look to social media for inspiration many have made a conscious effort to add social-first features to their platforms to attract a younger audience. Were confident that this trend is not only set to grow in 2023 but become an incredibly important component of any tech company within the financial space.\n\nWith social first features comes the development of community. Fintech platforms and apps will see this sense of community becoming even more paramount and this will become an integral part of service offerings.\n\nTraditional boundaries to investing have been lowered, meaning the incoming generation of investors are more confident in taking their first steps into the stock market. While this is fantastic and encouraging to see, there is a responsibility for financial companies to educate these younger consumers to make sure they have resources thatll help inform their investing journeys. Creating and incorporating accessible educational resources is set to also be a major component of the user experience in the next year within this sector.\n\nWithin our own platform, weve seen data that reflects the mindful attitudes of individuals, who are opting to invest in companies that match and support their vision. This can be seen across a variety of industries and corresponding values; such as sustainability, female or minority founders, social causes and other sectors that prioritise social responsibility. To attract not only investors but customers, companies within the fintech space will have to champion these values and have the transparency to demonstrate their commitment to the cause.\n\nIt's been a difficult year for investors and the trust they put in their investment platforms. Trust has always been critical in fintech, and we expect it to remain at the forefront of user decisions about where to store and grow their money. Trust signals will become increasingly important, and companies who prioritise this messaging stand to reap the rewards.\n\nMartin McCann, CEO, Trade Ledger\n\n2023 is probably going to be the biggest year of change for those in business and commercial banking for a generation for lots of reasons that are converging. Obviously theres the macroeconomic environment; those challenges are well understood. But whats less well understood is that we havent seen any change in technology, data or innovation in commercial banking for a very long time.\n\nNow thats changing. I think were going to see a new generation of technology and data enabled services in the next three years. As such, 2023 will be really important for those that want to deliver technically enabled and digital services in the banking for business space; this is the year that they must pay attention and be ready to make the move.\n\nYuelin Li, chief product officer, Onfido\n\nBetween the tapering of valuations and the increase in interest rates, the last year has indeed been tough for fintechs and the tech business at large. Innovation will continue, but businesses which are heavily dependent on zero or low interest rate financing costs such as [the BNPL] space may have a tough year.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, financial institutions are generally slower movers, and their digital transformations are a multi-decade process.\n\nWe expect that many of these companies will seize this point of instability to acquire some high-flying fintechs and their attractive customer profiles, at more attractive prices. Additionally, businesses that benefit from holding balances will likely see more investment opportunities come their way.\n\nPrakash Pattni, MD for financial services digital transformation, IBM\n\nThe fintech space has gone through immense changes in recent years, with the emergence of new business models and services in areas of rising demand, from digital assets to mobile banking services. At the same time, new offerings and collaborations between fintech and banks have created new areas of risk, attracting the attention of financial regulators. In 2023, we could see increasing regulatory scrutiny and this is where hybrid cloud capabilities and industry clouds will have an important role to play. Industry-informed and standardised built-in compliance and security controls can make specialised cloud platforms vital to reduce risk throughout the industry, particularly to help facilitate secure and compliant collaboration between fintechs and banks.\n\nIn 2022 we also saw an increasing focus from both consumers and financial institutions in tracking energy usage and environmental impact. Measuring progress towards sustainability goals is top of mind for financial services businesses, which need to share this data to meet regulatory requirements and keep stakeholders informed. As a result, there is going to be a larger focus on technology that improves energy efficiency across entire IT operations without sacrificing security or performance. Banks and fintech will look to a hybrid cloud approach to build and run applications on a smaller footprint and help reduce the carbon footprint, allowing them to optimise their progress towards environmental, sustainability and governance goals.\n\nAnother trend that is set to accelerate in 2023 is the shift from fintech services focusing mostly on the consumer-facing elements of digital banking, to solving deeper digital transformation challenges in the mid- and back-office systems of financial institutions. As part of this journey, well see banks modernising further by making more strategic decisions about where to deploy their applications and workloads across their hybrid cloud platforms, leveraging mainframes and public clouds more seamlessly to speed up innovation and bolster security.\n\nPaul Lehair, investment director, AlbionVC\n\nThe CFO tech space will continue to rise as finance teams are eventually getting more software built for them following what happened to other functions first, [such as] sales, marketing, HR [and] developer tools. These tools, especially for FP&A/cash flow management, should benefit from strong tailwinds with the downturn in 2023, which is leading to a renewed focus on accurate forecasts and cash efficiency.\n\nNew tools and companies will be built to make B2B payments (still largely offline) more digital and automated. The recession will serve as a catalyst to make B2B payments processes more efficient and cost-effective. As APIs continue to eat the world, more fintech processes and functions will be unbundled into API-first companies, which is also being fostered by the explosion of embedded finance in parallel.\n\nWe will see more M&A consolidation in fintech in 2023 as the fundraising market will continue its flight to very high quality assets, which will lead to many companies struggling to raise their next round and having to consider exits instead. Large and well-capitalised fintech companies should be able to purchase other companies at fairly attractive prices.\n\nLuke Ladyman, COO and co-founder, Cheddar\n\nGen Z will change the scope of fintech technology. The last few years have been a rollercoaster ride for Gen Z to say the least. Theyve gone through a pandemic, lockdowns, a cost-of-living crisis and now a recession arguably making them the most financially insecure generation.\n\n2023 will see the rise in consumer experience expectations, ensuring that fintech technology works to remedy Gen Zs financial and personal pain points. Expect to see services that are more tailored to help this generation save money whilst they spend.\n\nFintechs will [continue to] empower consumers to better manage their finances. The next year will see an increase in value and added incentives for consumers through prioritising money saving promotions, switching to new products and cashback opportunities when choosing where to shop during these challenging times.\n\nExpect to see a renewed push for digital currencies and frictionless banking made possible by advances in Open Banking (the use of open APIs that enable third-party providers to build applications and services around someones bank), further placing emphasis on bank-agnostic tools that offer consumers more choice and personalised offerings.\n\n[We will also see a further] expansion of open banking across the UK, EU and perhaps an introduction to North America.\n\nThe UK currently leads the pack when it comes to the utilisation of open banking. The year ahead will see greater efficiencies when purchasing goods i.e., instant payments to businesses at a fraction of the cost of card payments.\n\nWith the likes of Canada now allowing businesses to charge for card payments, solutions that bypass these networks will come to the forefront of economies squeezed by rising costs.\n\nMelba Montague, head of banking and capital markets, Genpact\n\nDespite ongoing economic turmoil, the UK has managed to retain its dominance as Europes major financial centre and London, as the Silicon Valley for fintechs. While 2023 looks rocky still, fintechs are known for swift innovation constantly adapting and reinventing themselves and will ride this wave.\n\nAccess to capital will be a huge hurdle for rapidly evolving fintechs looking to continue their scaling journeys across the UK and beyond. The fintechs that capture their part of the pie will be those that focus on and demonstrate to investors one word: resilience.\n\nStaying laser-focused on operational basics to prove their worth, especially as the world watches the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and [crypto lender] BlockFi. Investors will expect to see fintechs follow regulatory advice, lower their reputational risks, keep customers well-protected, and utilise innovative technology to accelerate and scale their processes and maintain compliance.\"\n\nThere is also no doubt that regulatory complexities will increase in 2023. Take BNPL as an example. Its explosive resurgence has made it an attractive alternative to traditional spending this year, although not without its risks.\n\nIt will be imperative for fintechs to take the high ground and look for innovative ways to both educate and protect their customers whilst getting ready for regulations recommended by the FCA come into play in 2023. BNPL providers have made growth commitments to investors. They will be expected to keep those promises next year, as well as keep operations stable and their customers safe and secure.\n\nMatt Davies, chief marketing officer, SEON\n\nAs we near the end of the year, were trying to highlight what the future of fraud might look like. Watching costs in an economic downturn is becoming more critical and reducing the cost of fraud is now becoming the most essential part of ensuring increased profit margin.\n\nRight now, it feels like were moving into a new digital era, where the blending of online and offline personalities is more pronounced, and ultimately more complex. At the same time, there are now new technologies emerging, which have the potential to make online fraud more difficult to spot.\n\nSolutions like deepfakes and AI chatbots are going to make it much harder for people to authenticate themselves online very soon. The combination of these two factors should concern people. We may quickly find ourselves in a world where its increasingly difficult to tell real and fake profiles apart. Unfortunately, we might begin to see the first signs of this in 2023, so its important people are prepared.\n\nFraudsters can easily pose as customers, but they cannot replicate the digital footprints and history of legitimate people as its not economical for them. The types, speed and sophistication of fraud attacks is advancing all the time, so the ability to help organisations reduce the cost of fincrime and help create a fraud free world is going to be a key talking point for the next few years. Everyone at SEON is very excited about rising to that challenge.\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to high-growth economies in emerging markets, such as those in the APAC and LATAM regions theres been a longstanding challenge around individuals with minimal, or non-existent credit histories. In the past, this lack of data had undermined the efficacy of certain fraud prevention checks.\n\nLouis Carbonnier, co-founder and co-CEO, Hokodo\n\nI think embedded finance will continue to be a huge trend in 2023. Fuelling this trend is the fact that banks have slowly been losing their monopoly over financial services as tech firms, retailers and other non-traditional players create digital-first offerings that are more cost-effective and more efficient than the incumbent solutions. Off the back of this, another trend well see is banks partnering up with more agile fintech firms to offer the services that theyre not capable of offering alone.\n\nWhat else? With the recession, well likely see an uptick in fraudulent activity and innovative measures to combat it. Elsewhere, compliance and regtech will become even more important. Companies will place greater value on sustainability and corporate responsibility when choosing to buy from or partner with you. Fintech employers will need to learn how to retain the talent theyve attracted, or face losing quality employees as trends like the great resignation and quiet quitting continue to gather pace.\n\nI think my last point above around learning how to retain talent is going to be really important for moving fintech forward in 2023. The attitude of the workforce is changing as the number of millennials in key roles grows. No longer do employees just want a job, they now place vast importance on aspects of work like culture and development. And by culture, Im not referring to table tennis and free fruit!\n\nFor many years, fintech companies have claimed to revolutionise financial services, but weve been doing this in a buoyant environment, backed by exuberant investors that only looked at the top line. Now, were about to undergo a litmus test that will determine which fintechs were actually creating value through the cycle. I dont think weve hit the bottom of the cycle yet. The next months will be a real test of character for the fintech sector. Paradoxically, if I were an investor, Id seek to invest now as valuations will be more appealing and its going to be easier to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nDarren Westlake, CEO and co-founder, Crowdcube\n\nWeve seen how 2022 brought fresh volatility to a market that was already recovering from the throes of the global pandemic. Yet, despite it all, alternative finance had a strong year in 2022 and 2023 looks like it will continue to grow. Whats more, non-traditional forms of funding are increasing in popularity and accessibility for scale-ups and start-ups of all shapes and sizes.\n\nFounders need to enter 2023 with an open mind and consider every avenue of funding they can - particularly as VC funding might well be harder to come by next year. And now that the Enterprise Investment Scheme has been extended, the tax relief to investors is sure to continue to serve as a powerful draw for many in todays conditions. Businesses simply cannot afford to ignore the potential of this opportunity.\n\nLiudas Kanapienis, co-founder and CEO, Ondato\n\nThe biggest corrections in fintech space happened in 2022 so I would expect 2023 to be more focused on stability and efficiency increase which might bring opportunities to new startups or existing market players to use them and rise. Also I believe new business models might come up, especially in credit space.\n\nAlternative financing is expected to grow in the coming years due to the \"expensive money\" on the financial markets and rising interest rates.\n\nSpeaking of efficiency, I also believe there will be more AI-powered resources and apps in 2023. AI automation takes over the manual process, thus saving time, meaning that fintechs and traditional banks can save labor expenses and big budgets. As a result, data-driven AI will enhance capital optimisation. This year has shown how manual processes are not easily scalable, as banks around the world discovered when they have been overwhelmed by the unprecedented increase in sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEd Halsey, the co-founder and COO, hubb\n\nThe advancement of financial technology, or fintech, has been exponential in recent years. We have seen a whole new world of opportunity open up for businesses and consumers alike. So, what does the future hold? Here are five [of my] fintech predictions for 2023.\n\nOpen banking is a term used to describe the practice of making data accessible to third-party developers. This could include transaction history, account balances, and other financial data. Open banking started as a way to promote competition in the banking industry and give consumers more control over their data. However, it quickly evolved into something much more. In 2023, open banking will start to be utilised to offer personalised and on-demand ancillary services such as real-time insurance.\n\nEmbedded finance refers to the integration of financial products into other non-financial products and platforms. For example, you may have seen \"buy now, pay later\" options when checking out online. This is a form of embedded finance. In 2023, we will see a whole new era of embedded finance within buying journeys, offering credit for even the simplest and smallest of purchases, which could become dangerously normalised during the economic downturn and recession.\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security purposes. Cryptocurrency is decentralised, meaning it is not subject to government or financial institution control. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, but there are many others out there as well. In 2023, cryptocurrency will take a giant leap forward in adoption, but with a significant move towards tokens with utility rather than pure currency plays.\n\nBlockchain is a distributed database that allows multiple parties to securely record transactions without the need for an intermediary like a bank or government institution. Blockchain has been talked about for years as a game-changing technology with endless potential applications. However, so far it has mostly existed in the theoretical realm due to issues such as scalability and lack of regulation. In 2023, forced migration from legacy technology will begin to make blockchain more feasible and take it out of the theoretical and into the practical stages of deployment.\n\nIn any business, there are always two competing priorities: acquisition and retention/servicing costs. When times are good and profits are high, businesses can afford to spend more on acquiring new customers; however, when times are tough efficiency gains become much more important. In 2023, we predict that the focus will shift from customer acquisition to efficiency savings around servicing clients. This could mean anything from automating manual processes to using artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to handle customer queries outside of office hours.\n\nThe advancement of financial technology shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. We can expect even more innovation and disruption in the next few years as we move closer towards open banking becoming the norm, embedded finance taking over, cryptocurrency going mainstream(ish), blockchain moving from theory into practical applications, and efficiency becoming more important than customer acquisition costs.\n\nDelia Pedersoli, COO, MultiPay Global Solutions\n\nYounger consumers like millennials and Gen Z have grown used to paying via non-credit and debit card methods. The rise of [BNPL] is a perfect demonstration with its popularity pushing retailers to adopt it as an option at checkout. Research from Student Beans earlier this year found that nearly half (42%) of 16-24 year olds have used BNPL services in the last 12 months.\n\nAs the popularity and familiarity of BNPL booms, consumers are also increasingly open to trying other alternative payment methods. This year we will see increased innovation in this area as payment providers and retailers look to launch new systems that improve the customer experience and boost loyalty. With the cost-of-living crisis set to get worse in 2023, customer loyalty will become a major battleground for retailers and fintechs alike.\n\nNew alternative payment methods that are beginning to arrive on the market have the advantage that they reduce the number of businesses involved in the processing of a payment. This has the dual benefit of allowing businesses to get their money sooner (in many cases instantly), while also having significantly lower processing fees. With lower fees, retailers can pass on savings to customers who use these new payment methods, helping them enhance the relationship with shoppers at a time when many are closely watching their spending.\n\nAlex Mifsud, co-founder and CEO, Weavr\n\nB2B embedded finance will take centre stage in 2023. At a time when businesses are under pressure to do more with less, embedded finance can unlock new efficiencies. B2B SaaS and other B2B digital businesses can take advantage of this need by enhancing their offering through financial service provision.\n\nBy using the rich data that such B2B players collect and process for their business customers, they are able to offer relevant financial services such as payment optimisation, efficient collections and lower risk lending at the point of need.\n\nIn doing so, B2B SaaS and digital businesses have the opportunity to add significant new revenue streams from their existing customer base in other words, increasing their revenues without the need to increase their marketing budgets.\n\nAccording to recent analysis of the fast-moving embedded finance sector from Bain & Co and Bain Capital, revenue opportunities \"will more than double from $21bn in 2021 to $51bn in 2026. The transaction value of embedded finance also will surge to $7tn by 2026 and account for 10% of US financial transactions\".\n\nWith this in mind, the embedded finance space is set to become increasingly crowded, with many vendors providing point solutions to emerging embedded finance challenges like on-boarding, monitoring and orchestration. However, only a small number of players who put together a well-curated range of financial services and tools, often by combining such point solutions will be the ones that succeed.\n\nBanks that have invested in [BaaS] will start to see their first challenges [such as partnerships going wrong with this approach to delivering embedded finance.\n\nFinally, established players in the banking and payments landscape, such as the big banking tech vendors, and the card schemes will start to publish their own strategies and roadmaps for embedded finance.\n\nRegulation and compliance [will also pay big role in the fintech industry in 2023]. Regulators will be more demanding of standards in embedded finance and this will force change in the way providers deliver it. Compliance-as-a-Service provision and adoption will increasingly displace the current BaaS model.\n\nIn addition, there will be increased M&A activity, partly as a result of the continued tough funding environment and partly because regulatory change will force providers to think about their ability to adapt. Well see continued consolidation as the bar gets higher due to stricter regulation and as funding gets tighter.\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, co-founder and CEO, TeamApt\n\nI think in the next 12 months VC activity will start increasing, and we are already seeing signs of that with a number of deals being done.\n\nThe only thing that will sustain will be around longer timelines for investing as VCs will be keen on doing deep due diligence. Valuations will continue to be pegged to the fundamentals of a company, such as their unit economics, and there will be a focus on high quality transactions where the business models are proven.\n\nWe expect the tailwinds around cashless transactions will continue to drive the adoption and penetration of fintechs which fill a gap or solve pain-points for customers in these areas. In addition, regulators will be more keen to take on newer innovations particularly those that are closely related to crypto, given the recent turmoil in the ecosystem.\n\nConsolidation will start to happen in the fintech space in form of collaboration with banks, but also larger fintechs forming strategic partnerships with smaller ones.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, fintechs must focus on customer experience to make sure they continue to protect their customers from any fraudulent activities in the months and years ahead.\n\nBrian Hanrahan, CEO, Nuapay\n\nIn 2023 open banking will reach a tipping point in terms of consumer adoption. Recent research conducted by Nuapay found that one in four payments decision makers at merchant businesses think open banking will become the most popular payment method for customers by 2027.\n\nWhen asked which payment method presents the most opportunities for their organisation over the next 3 years, Open Banking was the top choice (36%) among the merchants we spoke to, followed by digital wallets (35%) and [BNPL] (26%).\n\nEmbedded finance will also continue to gain momentum in 2023. The market is forecast to grow rapidly, with Juniper Research predicting that it will be worth more than $248.4bn by 2032, an astonishing growth from its current value of $54.3bn in 2022.\n\nEmbedded finance is forecasted to take off in the coming years. Its clear to see why due to the various benefits that it provides particularly when paired with open banking. All the convenience of integrated financial services plus the many, varied advantages of open banking from cost reduction to improved data analysis opportunities combine to deliver an unparalleled payments experience.\n\nGiorgio Daher, UK sales director, Tuum\n\nAfter a particularly turbulent 2022, which saw global financial uncertainty reach levels that weve not seen in decades, next year, we will undoubtedly see demand for banking services which help people better manage and save their money.\n\nOur research earlier this year before the worst of the economic crisis had even hit already showed signs that people are adopting a more sensible approach to money particularly younger generations. Over half of Gen Z we surveyed already have savings accounts despite many not being in the workplace yet. They also came out top as the biggest users of services like round-up savings pots, and were the generation with the most appetite for more budgeting tools from their banks.\n\nBanking is becoming an even more integral part of peoples lives, and products/tools that help them transfer money among friends and family or split bills are strongly in demand not just by the younger tech-savvy generations but also by older generations.\n\nTo be able to quickly devise and bring to market new banking services, banks and financial service providers need to have the banking technology that enables them to gather data and act on it. Most banks have or are in the midst of digitally transforming their tech stacks and product offerings to be able to offer new digital banking services but next year, the focus will go beyond digital transformation to digital acceleration.\n\nDigital acceleration encompasses the next ag of transformation. Instead of banks simply digitalising existing workflows, digital acceleration brings the full potential of new digital capabilities into the very core of how banks do business. This requires banks and financial services providers to partner with third parties (including ones outside of financial services) through platforms. By doing this, they can both maximise the investments theyve made in their own technologies while also tapping into the innovative capabilities of external stakeholders.\n\nBBVA is a good example of a bank that is creating new products by embracing new technologies such as blockchain and teaming up with third parties; for example, earlier this year, BBVA collaborated with Bolsas Mercados Espaoles (BME), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and builders to launch the first blockchain-based regulated bonds in Spain. By looking beyond their own capabilities, banks can embrace new opportunities and extend their product offerings to be able to offer personalised and innovative services to customers and grow market share.\n\nWe are already seeing the rise of platformification in the banking sector, 2023 will see digital acceleration come to the fore as an important phenomenon in the future of banking.\n\nAndy Lyons, head of banking partnerships and solutions, Contis\n\nIn 2023 we will see more well-known consumer brands entering the financial services market offering white-labelled banking solutions like accounts, cards, and payments all under the umbrella of embedded finance. These large consumer businesses will drive forward partnerships with third-party providers like insurers, lenders, and investment managers to capture more of the customer journey.\n\nRewards as a means of promoting loyalty will become more common, in the form of discounts at other merchants, cashback, or promotional offers surrounding the customers favoured product range. Embedded finance via open banking payments will also continue to gain traction and these payments mark a major shift that is extremely useful for consumers, given that this process requires little card or data entry.\n\nBut all innovations especially in financial services must take place within a regulatory framework. In 2023 I predict regulatory developments regarding SEPA instant payments the mechanism which will allow anyone with a euro-denominated bank account to make an instant (within ten seconds) transfer. Meanwhile, the licensing process for crypto firms will become more onerous across the UK and Europe.\n\nAll this is leading to a world where businesses are more diversified, with a larger slice of each customers attention and spend. This will naturally lead to more boisterous competition, and those that arent adopting the embedded finance mindset could easily be left behind. In 2023, the global business that get ahead will be not just retailers or online vendors but integrated financial services firms offering customers better efficiency and value-for-money.\n\nNikhil Shah, founder, Polyhedron\n\nThe fintech landscape has transformed in recent years with the rise of BaaS. Weve seen innovative collaboration with retail banking players like Starling and Holvi who have opened their API to benefit clients. And yet, this has not taken off for their corporate counterparts.\n\nWhy? There are myriad opportunities that could be solved; think about how approaches to payroll, a crucial permanent function, could be progressed into an entirely seamless experience for the modern employee. This could go as far as flexible pay, for example. Looking to 2023, as the appetite for BaaS has grown, so will partnerships between smaller corporate banks and fintechs to provide corporate clients with the products, services and comprehensive insights they expect to drive growth.\n\nAndrew Tarver, founding partner and head of Motive Create, Motive Partners Biog\n\nFintech will continue to go through a reality check in 2023, that reality being revenue and more importantly, profitability. Emphasis has swung towards running a viable business, or having a business plan which demonstrates a path to viability. This is a good thing, the survivors of this shake-out will prosper in years to come.\n\nI also think there will be consolidation between the fintech community [and], more importantly, many more partnerships between fintech and incumbent financial institutions, think balance sheet meets tech.\n\nGrowth in the industry will focus on how tech supports fin. Innovations in technology, data intelligence, supporting increased flow of requests (think embedded finance), continued democratisation, expansion of tech enabled integration between participants and most importantly, we will start to see a new way to manufacture, and lifecycle manage financial products.\n\nThe headwinds will remain the guardrails of the industry, regulation, as they should be. 2022 has highlighted the fragility of the market and how innovative technology, left unregulated, can cause instability and losses to consumers. This needs to be addressed and 2023 will start to see appropriate controls put in place. Fintech requires positivity and belief to support greater adoption.\n\nFintech is all about changing the way someone interacts, someone processes, someone risk manages, someone integrates. Change requires belief and confidence in the ability of provider you are adopting. Any dent in belief, confidence or positivity will slow momentum, but as we see the true winners emerge, hopefully they will continue to fly the fintech flag for other entrepreneurs to prosper.\n\nMatt Smith, CEO and co-founder, SteelEye\n\nAfter a decade of growth and record fundraising in fintech, with fintech companies accounting for 21 of the UKs 44 unicorns today, we predict that in 2023 we will see this slow down to a much more modest pace. Data from investment manager Finch Capital shows funding reached $6bn in 2020 and $19bb in 2021, but we have witnessed a 25% drop in 2022 so far.\n\nThe number of new fintech firms founded is down 85% since 2020. Market consolidation continues, and fintech M&A spiked in the first half of 2022, with 591 recorded deals. So, it is possible that we are now on the other side of the fintech sector boom.\n\nOf course, the UKs rich fintech ecosystem still presents exciting investment opportunities, and there is no shortage of available capital. But in the current economic environment, investors will be much more cautious about where, when, and how much they invest. The higher cost of capital coupled with a tougher business environment in general will force some fintech firms out of the market, as we have already seen, and create a smaller sector. Those who do make it through will emerge stronger and more resilient.\n\nBefore the pandemic, neo-banks and consumer-centric fintech businesses dominated the conversation. Now, amid recession fears and following a period in which fintech valuations fell faster than any other tech vertical, technology that powers back office and control functions is coming into focus. Tightening budgets and scrutiny of performance are driving this trend, and the financial services industry is under pressure to improve operational efficiencies while proving it has learned from past mistakes.\n\nHowever, as the financial landscape becomes increasingly digital, so too does the risk of fraud, cybercrime, money laundering, data breaches, and market manipulation. In response, the RegTech market will continue to grow and evolve to meet the challenges of an ever-more tech-driven economy. SteelEyes 2022 State of Financial Services Compliance report showed that almost half of firms (44%) are planning to invest more in regtech solutions in the next year.\n\nJames Lynn, co-founder, Currensea\n\nThe cost of living crisis is having an impact on everyone, even VCs. The funding landscape has altered with the industry already experiencing a drive to profitability where value is more sought-after than ever before this will only accelerate next year. Where previously some fintechs may have been overvalued by investors based on potential or market trends, the sector is now seeing a return to investment basics and a focus on business fundamentals.\n\nThe fintechs that will thrive in the new investment landscape are those who can demonstrate a strong track record of growth and offer a solution that clearly delivers value for consumers at a point where household finances are under ever increasing strain.\n\nDave Lewis, CEO and founder, Ranqx\n\nAs a fintech we have a responsibility to provide a solution online that benefits all, a service which really helps people in society, and that ultimately benefits everyone. Small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) are the backbone of our economy, with small businesses making up 99.9% of total US businesses, according to Deloitte.\n\nDespite this, access to working capital and lending to SMBs is a huge global problem, which needs significant improvement.\n\nLikewise, in a post-Covid world, the so-called covidpreneurs, entrepreneurs who established their business during the pandemic are also finding it hard to access capital. Unfortunately, many of these businesses dont fit long-standing lending criteria established by the banks decades ago.\n\nDespite being decades old, many of these criteria have not evolved at all over time, which is leaving millions of businesses in the cold when it comes to accessing working capital.\n\nThis is where we could soon see real-time data driven digital insights technology start to swing the traditional reactive transaction engagement banks and credit unions have with SMBs, into proactive partnership relationships.\n\nBy leveraging alternative data sources when making lending decisions, incorporating a degree of science, and taking into consideration cultural and socioeconomic influences, these clever systems are helping to make SMB lending more accessible, efficient, frictionless, and will speed up the decision-making process. In fact, Deloittes 2019 SMB survey found that large and midsize banks often take over seven weeks to deliver a decision on a small business loan, compared to online, or alternative lenders that take between 24 to 48 hours.\n\nIn addition, Mambu found that 92% of SMBs are open to changing lenders for different or simpler digital support. As such, theres now clear evidence to suggest data-driven lending systems are the future of SMB credit lending, enabling banks and credit unions to adopt more digital first approaches to their interactions with SMBs.\n\nIf you ask me, this is where well really start to see traditional financial institutions accelerate fintech partnerships that begin to overtake Technology Tourism. As traditional banks realise the speed at which the fintech ecosystem is eating their lunch, the appetite to proactively partner with fintechs will accelerate. Well see traditional banking finally realise that the lengthy and costly internal build versus buying in of the expert technology that already exists, as a no brainer, working together to accelerate the deployment of digital products that meet market needs and benefitting everyone.\n\nBrad Hyett, CEO, phos\n\nIn 2022, we've seen a growing interest in SoftPoS. More retailers and merchants are beginning to understand the cost-saving benefits of serving a customer through a mobile application with Tap to Pay acceptance.\n\nWith Apple announcing their move into the space earlier this year, this is really going to drive both the awareness and the normalisation of SoftPoS. Its a contributing factor to merchants acceptance of the technology as well as consumer understanding of it. These two aligning factors will only drive more curiosity in 2023.\n\nPayPal and Venmo have also announced their support for Apples Tap to Pay functionality as it continues to roll out across new payment platforms and apps. With SoftPoS solutions now readily available for Android and iOS operating systems, merchants and legacy technology providers should be seeking to partner with a SoftPoS orchestrator to take advantage of the new technology and exponentially increase their acceptance points for contactless payments.\n\nBy working with a technology partner, businesses can avoid the high costs and time consuming nature of creating an in-house solution, resulting in faster speed to market and the agility to better respond to customer demand.\n\nRobert Podlesni, CPO, Revolv3\n\nSince the fintech industry covers a wide variety of financial verticals, including multiple market spheres, such as SaaS payments, we expect fintech to become even more nuanced and dynamic in what it can offer the world of finance. By incorporating both our digital and physical wallets to facilitate commerce and economic activity, fintech is expected to carry on with improving the way we transact, for both the B2C and B2B markets.\n\nFintech's role as mediator between the physical and digital realm of the finance industry continues to be highly valued, especially as the boundaries are blurring. And since fintech offers more flexibility and versatility in how we bank, manage finances, and conduct commerce, the ability to move seamlessly between the physical and digital, or retail and ecommerce worlds, is evolving.\n\nIn 2023, we can expect to see a continued growth of financial inclusion. This trend is driven by innovations like Artificial Intelligence and Web3 enabling fintechs to deliver financial services at scale. Were experiencing a greater selection of more flexible payment services, not to mention alternative financing, driven by financial software developments. Across fintech, the proliferation of use cases for machine learning and AI has also driven the need for more granular, cleaner, and consistent data that maintains compliance and privacy protections.\n\nA greater migration to modern tech stacks is also expected. With looming economic recessions and stresses in overall collection rates, revenue and churn have pushed companies to embed financing options, payment alternatives, and increased vertical and horizontal reach. With the industry embracing alternative financing/payment models, increased visibility on transactions/payment performance and the impact companies are seeing from macroeconomic stresses are expected.\n\nWerner Knoblich, chief revenue officer, Mambu\n\nIn 2022, we've seen a growing interest from Big Tech in finance, with the likes of Apple breaking into the space by introducing Tap to Pay and partnering with PayPal, it wont be long before others follow suit. In comparison to fintechs, big techs have the reputation, technology and consumer data to help inform their strategy in the market.\n\nHowever, as weve seen many times before, a crisis can lead to opportunity. For example, a fintech with a low valuation presents a great opportunity for legacy players that are looking to expand their digital offering and have the capital to leverage.\n\nThis year alone, weve seen a sharp rise in the number of mergers and acquisitions in the fintech space and the prime driver for this is increased interest rates and overstretched valuations of high-growth companies. This is likely to continue in 2023 as more opportunities arise and fintechs are seen as more of a friend than a foe.\n\nWeve seen established banks like JP Morgan acquire new fintechs like Renovite or launch a digital bank as they did with the launch of Chase in the UK. As such, its becoming easier for more traditional players to make big moves as there are fewer fintechs in the space and less competition. The advantage of spinoffs is you have more neo-banks who dont need to ask for banking licences which have become few and far between.\n\nIn 2023, I believe fintechs and banks alike will partner more closely to adapt to the changes 2022 has presented. After all, agility in uncertain times is in a fintechs nature and by design what theyre built to do.\n\nBala Kumar, Chief Product Officer, Jumio\n\nIdentity-related fraud will continue to pervade the sector in 2023, proving one of the biggest challenges financial services organisations will face. According to UK Finance, losses from card ID theft alone, where a criminal uses stolen or fake documents to open a card account in someone elses name, increased 86% in the first six months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, from 11.5m to 21.4m.\n\nWith the cost-of-living crisis being felt, financial services organisations will need to do all they can to combat opportunistic fraudsters to protect their customers finances more than ever. Our recent global research found that over half of UK consumers (57%) would be more likely to engage with an online financial services provider if it had robust identity verification measures in place. Therefore, organisations should build on this consumer appetite in 2023 and truly embrace measures, like digital identity, as the only real and robust enough way to stamp out identity-related fraud.\n\nTim Annis, UK Managing Director, Bluechain\n\nMerchants will struggle and be at greater risk of not getting paid in the next 12 months if they do not have an efficient and user-friendly digital payment process for their customers.\n\nWith two pandemic years behind us, the current economic instability and the increased cost of living, businesses must consider the impact on the everyday person. Almost eight million people in the UK alone are struggling to pay their bills, and there is an opportunity for businesses to improve the lives of these people with choice and flexibility in how they pay and get paid.\n\nIn 2023, we will also see a move away from credit as people look to spend the money they have, rather than the money they dont have. This will support the growth of open banking and account-to-account payments, providing businesses with access to data faster to craft entirely new customer-friendly payment scenarios.\n\nDirect debits are archaic. Secure bill-to-pay processes will help consumers pay in a way that suits them within terms and give businesses visibility of what is coming in and out. Unfortunately, this current cycle of pressure and inflation will not go down for a while, so the industry must help society regain control of its finances during uncertain times.\n\n.\n\nLeo Labeis, CEO, REGnosys\n\nOver the past few years, regtech has emerged as one of the fastest advancing areas of financial technology and we should expect this trajectory to continue over the next 12 months.\n\nSector growth is particularly evident in regulatory reporting a subsidiary of regtech in which 2022 saw several important developments. The amendments to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions swaps reporting rules (CFTC Rewrite) in December 2022 and upcoming changes to the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) in April 2024 as well as updates to several Asia-Pacific reporting regimes are part of a global overhaul of G20 trade reporting rules. RegTech is playing a central role in helping firms comply with the new standards.\n\nThe Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) programme provides a clear example of this. While regulatory reporting has long been mired by ambiguous and conflicting rules, DRR equips firms and their regulators with a shared language to digitise the reporting requirements in a transparent, standardised and cost-effective way.\n\nKPMG has outlined regtech as a particularly hot sector in the EMEA region in the last few months, with programmes like DRR demonstrating that it will continue to lead the way in financial innovation throughout 2023.\n\nPeter Ku, vice president and chief global strategist, Informatica\n\nIn 2023, well see a marked shift from human-led activity to a greater reliance on AI and machine learning technologies within financial services organisations. This will be most prevalent in two areas data management and governance.\n\nFinancial services organisations will adopt data fabrics and data mesh at scale as they look to operationalise data, solve quality issues and improve compliance. Gartner predicts that data fabric deployments will quadruple efficiency in data utilisation while cutting human-driven data management tasks in half.\n\nHuman intervention will be lower in the areas where automation can do the heavy lifting, helping speed decision-making, reduce error and improve efficiencies. But well see a significant uptick in using data by the line of business teams tasked with delivering seamless customer experiences, making informed decisions on issuing loans, negotiating insurance packages, and detecting fraud. Enabling this will require self-service data governance delivering trusted, high-quality data to the right teams, right at the moment they need it, all in a fully governed and compliant way. Chief Data Officers (CDOs) will be tasked with supporting less centralised data governance programs and ensuring it is tightly coupled with business priorities.\n\nThe challenging global economic climate is placing increased focus on reducing cost but financial services organisations cannot cut corners. Instead, CDOs should look to leverage data management solutions that bring the power of AI and [machine learning] to bear to scale their data governance policies and processes while reducing the cost incurred by human-led effort, who can instead look to leverage data to innovate and drive value for the business.\n\nArunabh Madhur, regional VP and head of business EMEA, SHAREit Group\n\nAs consumer demand for greater convenience grows stronger, we expect to see mobile payments explode even more next year. Customers have become increasingly comfortable with making digital payments which is helping to fuel the growth in multiple verticals, such as ecommerce, social, foodtech, gaming etc. In the near future, flexibility and innovation around payment options will continue to enhance the customer experience.\n\nDigital payment methods, which enable card payments via smartphones, have not only streamlined the customer journey but also facilitated to drive the digital and financial inclusion for the large unbanked population in emerging markets. With digital wallets becoming a core part of payments and online shopping experiences, mcommerce transactions will also continue to grow. The growth will evidently expand into 2023 and beyond and for companies who wish to benefit from such growth, it is vital that they adapt to the digital payment changes to ensure future success.\n\nLars Seier Christensen, founder, Saxo Bank\n\nThe current washout is equivalent to the Dotcom Crash of 2001, after which the real internet revolution accelerated.\n\nThe current innovations in the DeFi space holds great potential for the TradFi industry, but is marred by a lack of regulation and too many dubious and incompetent actors. Cleaning up this space and reducing the FOMO and cash grab motivation will open for real partnerships and opportunities between the old and the new world.\n\nTokenisation will accelerate and begin to show how many more assets can be offered efficiently to a broader investment public than is the case today.\n\nInstant transfers with new and trustworthy stablecoins, backed 1:1 by assets and issued by credible players, are another great opportunity for making payments much more efficiently than what we know today in TradFi.\n\nBetter inclusion of currently unbankable clients is a large opportunity, but needs to happen in a regulated environment. Regulation will accelerate in 2023 and the next years, creating a more solid foundation for such initiatives.\n\nPortable ID/KYC that we work on at Concordium will make for easier onboarding and safer interactions in the developing Web3 space.\n\nBoth the old and new world in finance can benefit enormously from collaboration and I think we will begin to see more examples of this in 2023.\n\nMerlin Piscitelli, Datasite CRO, EMEA\n\nWith global technology company valuations and investments down in the last 12 months, and the technology industrys new focus on profit generation, especially among startups and mid-sized companies, the fintech sector is likely to experience some consolidation in 2023.\n\nRather than fighting and competing against each other or looking for investment and acquisitions from bigger companies, smaller fintech companies will look for opportunities to collaborate to compete globally including, pursuing joint ventures to reduce operational costs. What was previously driven by finance, will now become more about synergies.\n\nPaul Marcantonio, executive director UK & Western Europe, ECOMMPAY\n\nAn emerging fintech growth space, the metaverse, will bring additional function and fun into the world of payments in 2023. We can expect to see innovations in cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications that will be more appealing to the digitally sophisticated audience of early adopters. But there will also be opportunities to utilise payment methods that have been working outside of the metaverse, such as open banking and BNPL.\n\nAny metapayment method explored needs to technically accessible so that there are clearly defined links to traditional currency. But as long as transactions are instant, not close to real-time the payment options will be viable. Metapayments will bring the concept of the consumer to a whole new level in the next few years. The possibilities are endless.\n\nWissam Khoury, EVP, Treasury & Capital Markets, Finastra\n\nThe pandemic, global conflicts, economic and political uncertainty: in the last few years, weve witnessed an increased frequency of extreme events that have impacted financial services and placed more strain on a banks balance sheet. Additionally, we are seeing fast-changing regulations and increasing cost pressures, meaning banks have to increase their ability to adapt to new demands while decreasing their total cost of ownership.\n\nAs these events continue to impact financial services. In 2023 we expect to see an increased importance of the role of the treasury and banks embracing digital transformation to remain relevant. By phasing out their legacy technology and moving their operations into a cloud environment, banks can adapt quicker to ongoing uncertainty and future-proof their investments through systems and solutions that provide the agility, adoption rate and functionality to meet regulatory deadlines. They can also reduce costs, scale their business and improve functionality with faster upgrades and enhanced services.\n\nIn 2023, we expect to see a continued shift in the treasurys mindset from build to buy. Banks are increasingly buying the latest solutions from specialist fintechs instead of developing them in-house, but we expect to see particular growth in the as-a-Service subscription model due to its myriad benefits.\n\nBy purchasing and deploying fully managed solutions which provide functional and technical enhancements in their core, banks can become a future-ready, integrated platform with increased agility and lower TCO through tech stack modernization and deployment. There will be increased connectivity with ecosystems which allow banks to implement, via APIs, specialised fintech applications which accelerate the rollout of regulatory requirements.\n\nRobert Prigge, CEO, Jumio\n\nThe financial services industry is at a turning point, where the global economy is shifting to authorising purchases and other transactions based on user identity rather than credit card numbers.\n\nConsumers are increasingly leveraging biometric authentication to access their saved credit card information, banking apps and digital payment methods, like Apple Pay. As consumers increasingly use their identity to access and complete transactions in 2023, its likely well see the number of transactions completed with digital identities surpass those of credit cards.\n\nDaniele Servadei, CEO and co-founder, Sellix\n\nIn 2023, I expect to see a 50% increase in fintech product sales across the world. Many fintech firms will fail amid market and customer movements, but many others will grow and take their place. Cryptocurrencies will start taking more and more ground as available payment methods. Fintech providers will also invest heavily in UI and UX in a bid to increase their competitive advantage.\n\nVenkatesh Varadarajan, partner, Infosys Consulting\n\nThe globalisation of banking is opening finance up to a whole variety of new fraud situations. Increasingly, consumers can move finances online between standalone bank accounts in different countries, but this heightens the risk of money laundering and financial crime.\n\nIn 2023, well see more banks attempt to combat this by adopting tools that enable the earlier detection of suspicious activity in transactions. AI and machine learning tools have already seen a lot of traction post-Covid and during the economic bounce back. However, adoption will become more widespread as banks look to conduct data-backed sense checks which can identify causes and ensure the detection of fraud much earlier in the lifecycle.\n\nBoth banks and insurance firms will continue to beef up operational, security and technology remediation activities to better identify potential risks. This means more audits of various processes, including legacy technology and disaster recovery. As threats increasingly target these business-critical areas post-Covid, well see more programmes being driven under direct guidance from leadership, and teams bolstered by SMEs and external support.\n\nBNPL is here to stay. Its cemented itself as a new payment method, offering a flexible, faster way for consumers to purchase items. In the past year, weve seen UK banks like NatWest, HSBC, Monzo and Virgin Money all launch BNPL products, to increase appeal amongst younger customers where demand for the service is high. In 2023, well see the bigger players move from strength to strength in this area, buoyed by consumers typically gravitating towards more established banks during economic uncertainty.\n\nThis isnt to say smaller players like Klarna will suffer. In 2023, we can expect the tussle between the two sides to continue. As the cost-of-living crisis continues, a key challenge is ensuring consumers dont overspend and fall into debt. Bigger banks have an upper hand as they can access rich customer data based on multiple transactions, credit cards and mortgages.\n\nOn the other hand, fintechs like Klarna and Clearpay are far nimbler and quicker at mining this information. Both sides will need to better utilise these capabilities, as its likely more regulation will be introduced in 2023 requiring firms to check customers can afford to use their products.\n\nThe metaverse is still a relatively small market, but itll grow substantially over the next decadeforecasts suggest by almost 40% yearly between 2022 and 2030. A lot of banks are already using the metaverse for training purposes, but it has huge potential to enhance the customer experience and excite customers to bank and shop for new products. Virtual banking is a growing space and can help keep banking costs down, reducing the need for physical space and enabling branch optimisation.\n\nBig Tech is already placing large stakes in this, and the intersection of tech and financial services will accelerate over the next few years. Major players like Meta, Appl, and Amazon all have a deep understanding of customer behaviour. They will use this data to wire up consumers in various ways and financial services are a critical component of this.\n\nIn terms of regulation, itll be smaller rules coming in that impact other channels, rather than big-ticket ones that we see in capital markets or investment banking. Like weve seen with certain sets of regulations introduced off the back of branch openings, then contact centres, then the internet and most recently mobile banking, the metaverse will be the next stage in this process as we look to virtual banks.\n\nCapital markets activity will continue to grow despite market volatility as more consumers invest in stocks and Isas. Previously, the customer base in capital markets was very institutional in nature. However, the pendulum has swung, especially towards younger generations, thanks to the accessibility and ease of stocks and shares platforms online and consumers sitting on more savings from lockdown which they are willing to invest.\n\nThese platforms have not only increased awareness and knowledge around investing, but low or zero fees charged have made it far easier to invest smaller sums of money. Well see momentum with capital markets activity continuing into 2023 and beyond as younger consumers look to grow their investments in the long term.\n\nCampbell Shaw, SVP of FI and publisher partnerships, Cardlytics\n\nTimes of economic downturn are often the catalyst for change and transformation, and this will be no different for fintechs in 2023.\n\nAs we see a continuation of the trend towards high street branch closures and fewer face-to-face interactions, with businesses look to save money and drive efficiencies, well also see more banks leveraging analytics to improve engagement.\n\nCapitalising on this data will be key for banks increasingly shifting operations online as they still look to deliver strong customer experiences and instil confidence for their users.\n\nWhilst leveraging spending insights will give banks a more informed view of customer situations and preferences, this shouldnt be used to assume we know the whole picture. This data should be used as a jumping off point to start conversations with customers, taking personalisation on a case-by-case basis and listening to their needs rather than dictating solutions based on raw numbers.\n\n2023 will also be a big year for the entire ecosystem as banks will be seeking further cooperation between themselves and fintechs.\n\nIn order to rapidly innovate and transform their offering, banks will need to rely more heavily on the solutions fintechs offer in order to provide new services at a much faster rate than, for example, spending the best part of a decade developing solutions themselves.\n\nA plugged in platform environment can enable frictionless data sharing between platforms and customers on behalf of the banks allowing them to respond quickly to changing needs.\n\nThat said, much of this information sharing will rely on accelerating the progress weve seen since open banking was introduced five years ago. Unless this continues to move forwards, banks and fintechs will continue to run into the same stumbling blocks, such as a lack of data interoperability, that stifle innovation across the industry.\n\nHenrik Rosvall, CEO and co-founder, Dreams Technology\n\nTo say that 2022 has been a turbulent year is quite an understatement. While the energy crisis has driven high levels of inflation, causing people around the world to face higher costs of living, banks are now bracing for even tougher economic conditions and a possible global recession in 2023.\n\nThis has created a real urgency for banks to further digitalise their channels and deliver new financial services that are more effective at helping customers to cope with ongoing inflationary pressures. As these macroeconomic realities intensify over the coming months, we are likely to see a greater number of banks pull the plug on their legacy, data-driven PFM solutions, in favour of more sophisticated tools which are backed by science and actively encourage users towards healthier financial habits.\n\nIn 2023, the ability to anticipate evolving customer needs, and in turn design user experiences that effectively drive intrinsic human behaviour and promote financial wellbeing, will differentiate forward-thinking banks from their rivals.\n\nEver since the pandemic began, banks have been forced to speed up their digital transformation processes. While many have found that building their own digital solutions is not only time-consuming but also extremely costly, there have been several regulatory changes in third-party policy that have come into place over recent years, which have enabled a plethora of partnership opportunities between banks and fintechs.\n\nAs we move into 2023, the circumstances brought about by the cost-of-living crisis will put even more pressure on financial institutions to further digitalise their services and meet the evolving needs and wants of consumers. Consequently, the number of banks collaborating with third-party providers will drastically increase, meaning the level of growth and investment within the B2B fintech space will reach new heights.\n\nAdditionally, B2B business models are more shielded from market volatilities than their B2C counterparts, and less vulnerable to rising inflation and interest rates. As the overall decline in spending continues to worsen in 2023, we can expect loan demands to fall and defaults to increase, which will further contribute to making B2B fintechs an attractive proposition, for both financial institutions and the investment community.\n\nThe green banking movement has been gathering plenty of momentum recently, with many banks having already committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions. In order to deliver on that commitment, banks are starting to explore how they can address their ESG targets in a more holistic way, which not only spans their own operations but also supports their customers own decarbonisation efforts.\n\nWith this in mind, in 2023, many banks will move beyond the traditional green financial products that have dominated the market in recent years, such as carbon footprint calculators, and instead implement solutions that are less data-focused and more effective at helping consumers adopt sustainable ways of living and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nDiscussions remain ongoing in Brussels around standardisation and the introduction of scope 4 as a way of making an impact in the ESG space and drastically accelerating the transition to net-zero. Whether that comes into play in 2023 remains to be seen. What is certain however, is that the concerns around climate change will not go away and the ESG agenda will only grow from strength to strength. The banks that truly stand out in 2023 will articulate a clear vision for playing a positive role in the lives of their customers, whilst improving their overall financial wellbeing and driving sustainable behavioural change.\n\nKevin OConnell, Chief Product Officer, Trust Payments\n\nThe need for convenient and simple payment options for consumers will continue to fuel the alternative payments space in 2023. The comeback of QR codes will continue as businesses look to bridge the gap between physical and digital for consumers in a safe and secure way.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how CBDCs grow as countries launch their own digital currencies to keep up with consumers changing financial needs. The boom of short-term lending and payment plans will slow down as the cost of living pushes people to pay with what they have, rather than dont have.\n\nAlex Reddish, MD, Tribe Payments\n\n2022 saw an expansion in easy-to-access consumer credit services, and it didnt come without some controversy. But while BNPL schemes are undoubtedly popular today, we may see some contraction in the market as circumstances change.\n\nA shifting macroeconomic climate will lead to a squeeze and responsible lending will be the key to sustainable business beyond 2023. A saturated market plus consumer hesitance over debt means that there will be a new battleground for growth. This is likely to be SME credit.\n\nSMEs have different needs, often looking for short term credit to cover cash flow, and are often underserved as a less \"glamorous\" target compared to consumer products. SME credit products have already been launched by fintechs, but we are likely to see consumer-facing brands take an interest too in 2023.\n\nCan a fintech business rely on interchange fees for a sizable chunk of its business? There has been some worry in the market that the acquirers, issuers and card schemes that rely on these charges cannot do so forever, and there is a need to diversify to be viable.\n\nAfter all, regulators reviewing the caps on these charges are likely to move them in one directionlowerand new types of payments may mean interchange fees are paid less and less often.\n\nHowever, these fees are, to an extent, inflation proof. As prices increase, so do the fees, remaining at a steady percentage of each purchase. The inflation weve seen in 2022 and are likely to see in 2023 means that people are trying to make their money go further, but are not necessarily spending less. So while some fintechs may see their business take a hit from changing circumstances, interchange fees are likely to remain relatively steadyat least in the short term.\n\nMichael Reitblat, CEO, Forter\n\nAt the pandemic's start, retailers were forced to implement multiple digital and physical touchpoints to keep shoppers engaged. During this time, we saw options such as buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS) and buy online, return in store (BORIS), contactless delivery and free delivery gain extreme popularity. Merchants that offered these omnichannel experiences flourished, and companies that did not struggled and even went out of business in some cases.\n\nThe long-term efficacy of these omnichannel strategies will play out in 2023. More specifically, retailers that harness AI and [machine learning] insights to understand their customers on a deep level (and on the flip side identify who is not a legitimate customer) will create superior experiences in-store and online. Ultimately, this will lead to stronger customer loyalty and lifetime value, all while stopping fraud from impacting the bottom line.\n\nGlobalData is the parent company of Verdict and its sister publications.",

Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week.\n\nBut Lukashenko, a pariah in the West who relies heavily on Moscow for support, has repeatedly said Belarus will not enter the war in Ukraine. Foreign diplomats say committing Belarusian troops would be deeply unpopular at home.\n\nAlready, Western sanctions have made it hard for Belarus to ship potash fertilizers, its top export, via Baltic ports.\n\nWestern military analysts say Lukashenkos small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Dec. 13 that it did not see \"any type of impending cross-border activity by Belarus at this time.\"",

Russias illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Tuesday condemned Irans support for Russia in its war in Ukraine and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. \"Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amidst deteriorating Iran-EU relations,\" Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan.\n\nUkraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others including heroes of this years war. Following Moscows invasion that has killed or injured untold numbers of civilians and soldiers and pummelled buildings and infrastructure, Ukraines leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its Communist past into one of \"de-Russification\".\n\nChina says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to \"further deepen\" cooperation between the sides whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscows invasion of Ukraine, AP reports. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by Chinas eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist partys military wing, the Peoples Liberation Army.\n\nPutin was in Belarus on Monday, where he and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, hardly mentioning the war raging in nearby Ukraine, conducted a late-night joint news conference, Reuters reports. Russian forces used Belarus as a launchpad for their abortive attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in February, and there has been Russian and Belarusian military activity there for months.\n\nAsked about Putins comment dismissing the prospect of Russia \"absorbing\" Belarus, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said it should be treated as the \"height of irony\", given it was \"coming from a leader who is seeking at the present moment, right now, to violently absorb his other peaceful nextdoor neighbour\". He added that Washington would continue to watch very closely whether or not Belarus would provide additional support to Putin and would respond \"appropriately\" if it does.\n\nRussias foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk ahead of Putins visit. The foreign ministers discussed \"specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the West, as well as interaction on international platforms\", Belarusian state media cited Belaruss foreign ministry as saying, as well as having \"touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Georgia on Monday to allow its jailed former president to go abroad for treatment to safeguard his health.\n\nMikheil Saakashvili, president of Georgia from 2004 to 2013, was initially credited with implementing reforms. He was later sentenced to six years in prison on abuse of power charges his supporters say are politically motivated.\n\nBelaruss defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces military preparedness, hours ahead of Putins visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus, which acted as a staging post for Russia to launch its invasion of Ukraine in February, could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for \"all possible defence scenarios\" against Moscow and its ally. \"Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,\" Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraines top military command. \"We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.\"\n\nThe exiled Belarus opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has warned that the chances of Minsk sending soldiers into Ukraine \"may increase in coming weeks\". Kyiv was \"right to prepare\" for Minsk to join Moscows new offensive because the probability \"might increase in coming weeks\", Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post.\n\nThe head of Moldovas security service, Alexandru Musteata, has warned of a \"very high\" risk of a new Russian offensive towards his countrys east. Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata said, adding that his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April.\n\nA Russian drone attack caused \"fairly serious\" damage in the Kyiv region on Monday and three areas have been left without power supply, governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia unleashed 35 \"kamikaze\" drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscows third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days.\n\nUkraines air force said it shot down 30 out of 35 of the Russian-launched Shahed drones overnight. The Iranian-made Shahed-136/131 kamikaze drones were reportedly launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov, the force added.\n\nRussias defence ministry said its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, in the space of 24 hours, the state-run TASS news agency reported. One person died and several were injured by Ukrainian shelling in the region on Sunday morning, the regions governor said.\n\nThe UNs secretary general, Antnio Guterres, said he believes Russias war in Ukraine \"will go on\" and does not see a prospect for \"serious\" peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he \"strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the \"consequences\" for Ukraines people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found\n\nRishi Sunak said that the west should reject unilateral calls by the Kremlin for a ceasefire in Ukraine and focus on \"degrading Russias capability to regroup and to resupply\" at a meeting of European leaders in Latvia. The UK prime minister was speaking at a summit of the 10-country Joint Expeditionary Force in the Latvian capital at a time of heightened concern as to whether Britain will continue the robust support for Ukraine that began under Boris Johnson.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy, asked western leaders meeting in Latvia to ramp up the supply of a wide range of weapons systems to his country. He called on leaders \"to do everything to accelerate the defeat\" of Russia, and said supplying air defence systems to Kyiv would be \"one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression and this step is required right now\".\n\nEU ministers have agreed a plan to cap the price of gas, ending months of argument over how to handle the cost of soaring energy prices after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. A gas price cap will kick in if prices on the main European gas exchange, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), exceed 180 (157) a megawatt-hour for three consecutive working days, far lower than the European Commissions original proposal of 275 a MWh, which had been derided by cap-supporting countries as a joke.",

This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nRussian forces conducted another massive series of missile strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure on December 29. Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces launched 69 cruise missiles and 23 drones at Ukraine and that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 54 of the missiles and at least 11 of the drones.[i] Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces struck targets, primarily infrastructure facilities, in Lviv, Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts causing widespread disruptions to energy, heating, and water supplies.[ii] Russian sources claimed that Russian forces also struck targets in Sumy, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytsky, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhia oblasts.[iii] The Belarusian Ministry of Defense claimed that Belarusian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian S-300 air defense missile during the wave of Russian strikes and that wreckage fell onto Belarusian territory.[iv] It is currently unclear whether Ukrainian air defenses may have been responding to Russian missile launches from Belarusian territory, which Russian forces have used repeatedly in support of their campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.[v]\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) responded to ongoing Western assessments that it has severely depleted its stock of high-precision weapons systems amidst the massive strike against Ukraine by stating that it would never run out of Kalibr missiles.[vi] ISW has previously assessed that Russian forces have significantly depleted their arsenal of high-precision weapons systems but will likely continue to threaten Ukrainian critical infrastructure at scale in the near term and cause substantial suffering to Ukrainian civilians.[vii] Ukraines Main Military Intelligence Directorate Chief Kyrylo Budanov stated on December 26 that Russian forces had enough missiles to conduct two or three more large-scale strikes.[viii] ISW assesses that the Russian campaign to break the Ukrainian will to fight through large-scale missile strikes against critical infrastructure will fail even if the Russians are able to conduct more barrages than Budanov estimated.[ix]\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated on December 29 Russias unwillingness to commit to genuine negotiations and to recognize Ukraine as an independent actor in negotiations. Lavrov stated in an interview with a prominent Russian news source that Russia will not accept Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys proposed peace plan and that the Kremlin will not talk to any Ukrainian negotiators under conditions that include the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukraine, Russian payment of reparations, and Russian participation in international tribunals.[x] Lavrov declared that he cannot determine whether an \"adequate,\" independent politician remains in Kyiv with whom Russia can negotiate.[xi] Lavrov claimed that Zelenskys refusal to pursue negotiations with Russia in April demonstrated the complete \"lack of independence of [Zelensky] in making important decisions\" and the manipulation of the West to continue hostilities.[xii] Lavrov questioned whether an \"acceptable\" politician would emerge under the \"Kyiv regime,\" apparently restating the Kremlins position that Zelensky is not a legitimate political leader or acceptable negotiating partner and recommitting Russia to its maximalist goal to drive regime change in Ukraine.[xiii]\n\nUkraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Chief Kyrylo Budanov stated that fighting in Ukraine is in a deadlock on December 29.[xiv] In an interview with BBC, Budanov stated that \"the situation is just stuck\" and that both Russian and Ukrainian troops lack the resources or ability to move forward.[xv] Budanov stressed that Ukraine cannot defeat Russian troops \"in all directions comprehensively\" and reiterated that Ukraine is awaiting the supply of new and more advanced weapons systems.[xvi] Budanovs statement is consistent with certain elements of ISWs December 28 assessment, which suggested that the Russian offensive around Bakhmut may be culminating and that Russian forces in this area will likely be unable to make operationally significant gains.[xvii] However, ISW also noted indicators that Russian forces may be preparing for a decisive effort (likely of a defensive nature) in Luhansk Oblast, which suggests that fighting writ large in Ukraine has not necessarily reached a stalemate.[xviii]\n\nThe Kremlin continues to manipulate Russian law to grant the state increasingly broad powers using vague language in order to eliminate dissent and threaten Ukrainian sympathizers. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a supplement to the Russian Criminal Code on December 29 that allows Russian authorities to sentence Russians to up to life imprisonment for \"assistance to subversive activities\" or for \"undergoing training for the purpose of carrying out sabotage activities\" and for \"organizing a sabotage community\" and between 5- and 10-years imprisonment for \"participation in such a community.\"[xix] Putin also signed a law enabling Russian authorities to sentence any private citizen who \"desecrates\" the ribbon of Saint George (a prominent Russian military symbol especially associated with the war in Ukraine) with up to 3 years imprisonment or a fine of up to three million rubles (40,541 USD).[xx] These laws follow a sequence of Russian policies targeting what remains of the Russian opposition and enhancing Kremlin control of Russias already-limited information space under the guise of preventing Russians from \"discrediting\" the military.[xxi]\n\nRepeated Ukrainian strikes on legitimate military targets far in the Russian rear demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defenses against drones. Ukrainian forces attacked Engels Airbase with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on December 29, within three days of reports that air defense shot down a Ukrainian UAV over Engels and killed three Russian servicemen.[xxii] The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (MoD) stated on December 29 that it is \"increasingly clear\" that Russia \"is struggling to counter air threats deep inside [its territory].\"[xxiii] The United Kingdom MoD assessed that Russian air defenses probably are struggling to meet the high demand for air defense for field headquarters near the front line in Ukraine while also protecting strategic sites, such as Engels Airbase.[xxiv] The repeated strikes on Engels Airbase will likely exacerbate milblogger critiques that Russia cannot defend its own territory from Ukrainian strikes. A prominent Russian milblogger questioned how Ukrainian UAVs and missiles cross such distances and enter Russian territory with \"such impunity\" and questioned the honesty of the Russian Ministry of Defenses response.[xxv] The milblogger joked that an undetected pilot landing in Red Square (referencing Matias Rusts 1987 flight from Helsinki to Moscow) would certainly generate a response longer than a single sentence from the Russian government.[xxvi] ISW reported on similar dissatisfaction among Russian milbloggers on December 26.[xxvii]\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nRussian forces conducted another massive series of missile strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Russias unwillingness to commit to genuine negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Chief Kyrylo Budanov stated that fighting in Ukraine is in a deadlock.\n\nThe Kremlin continues to manipulate Russian law to grant the state increasingly broad powers under ambiguous conditions in order to eliminate dissent.\n\nRepeated Ukrainian strikes on legitimate military targets in rear areas in the Russian Federation demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Russian air defenses against drones and exacerbate critiques that Russia cannot defend its own territory.\n\nUkrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations near Kreminna while Russian forces conducted limited counterattacks along the Svatove-Kreminna line.\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in the Avdiivka area as well as around Bakhmut, where the potential culmination of the Russian offensive is likely being expedited.\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct defensive operations in Kherson Oblast.\n\nThe Kremlins mobilization working group met for the first time on December 29. The forum for criticism of mobilization implementation will likely create friction with the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nRussian occupation authorities continue to intensify law enforcement crackdowns in unsuccessful attempts to stamp out partisan pressure in occupied territories.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations near Kreminna on December 29. Deputy Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the Ukrainian General Staff, Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, reported that Ukrainian forces have advanced 2.5km in the direction of Kreminna over the past week and are continuing offensive actions towards the settlement.[xxviii] Hromov stated that information is circulating among officers of the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LNR) 2nd Army Corps that a significant part of the 2nd Army Corps will surrender if Ukrainian forces break through the Svatove-Kreminna line.[xxix] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Ukrainian forces may capture Kreminna by the beginning of 2023.[xxx] A Russian milblogger claimed that 1,500 Ukrainian servicemen are currently trying to break through Russian positions near Kreminna from the direction of Torske (14km west of Kreminna), Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna), and Kuzmyne (3km southwest of Kreminna).[xxxi]\n\nRussian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Svatove-Kreminna line on December 29. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults northwest of Svatove near Stelmakhivka (16km northwest of Svatove) and Andriivka (16km west of Svatove) and northwest of Kreminna near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna) and Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna).[xxxii] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are probing Ukrainian positions in the vicinity of Hryhorivka (11km south of Kreminna).[xxxiii] Haidai reported that Russian forces are continuing to transfer more equipment and personnel to the Kreminna area, including a substantial number of Wagner Group personnel.[xxxiv] ISW assesses that Russian forces are likely preparing for a decisive effort in Luhansk Oblast, although it is still unclear whether this decisive effort is offensive or defensive.[xxxv]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on December 29. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Bakhmut; within 21km northeast of Bakhmut near Bilohorivka, Soledar, Bakhmutske, and Pidhorodne; and within 13km south of Bakhmut near Klishchiivka and Kurdyumivka.[xxxvi] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces withdrew from unspecified strongholds in Soledar and in Pidhorodne, where elements of the Wagner Group are attempting to cut off a section of the M-03 highway.[xxxvii] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces made notable advances in the southern parts of Bakhmut, although ISW cannot independently verify whether Russian forces have actually done so.[xxxviii] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces also conducted assaults south of Bakhmut near Opytne.[xxxix]\n\nThe rate of potential culmination of the Russian offensive on Bakhmut is likely being expedited by increased demands on already degraded personnel and equipment. Deputy Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the Ukrainian General Staff, Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, reported that Ukrainian forces repel up to 20 Russian assaults in the Bakhmut area daily.[xl] Hromov also reported that Russian forces concentrated 40 percent of their artillery fire along the 200km long frontline that runs from Kupyansk, Kharkiv Oblast to Marinka, Donetsk Oblast on Bakhmut.[xli] Hromov reported that Russian forces deliberately reduced indirect fire in Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts in recent weeks and delivered artillery rounds to the Bakhmut area to maintain the pace of artillery fire there.[xlii] ISW assesses that Russian personnel and equipment capacities in the Bakhmut area are severely degraded and that the Russian offensive to capture Bakhmut is likely culminating as a result.[xliii] Russian forces high demand on personnel and on artillery munitions to support a continued high pace of assaults will likely further degrade Russian forces operational capabilities in the Bakhmut area and quicken the rate of the Russian offensives culmination.\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area on December 29. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Avdiivka and within 32km southwest of Avdiivka near Krasnohorivka, Marinka, and Pobieda.[xliv] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are using defensive positions in high-rise buildings to establish strong points and adjust artillery fire in Marinka and suggested that this is allowing Ukrainian forces to slow the rate of Russian advances in the settlement.[xlv] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces continued routine indirect fire along the line of contact in Donetsk and eastern Zaporizhia oblasts.[xlvi]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nRussian forces continued defensive operations in Kherson Oblast on December 29. The Ukrainian General Staff stated that Russian forces in the Kherson direction are regrouping, reinforcing, and conducting positional defenses.[xlvii] The Head of the Ukrainian Joint Press Center of the Tavrisk Direction Defense Forces, Yevhen Yerin, stated that small Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups try to cross the Dnipro River on a daily basis and that Ukrainian forces are detecting and neutralizing the groups.[xlviii] Deputy Chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the Ukrainian General Staff, Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, noted that mobilized Russian forces are deploying to Kherson Oblast so that conventional combat units can withdraw to the rear and presumably refit for further redeployment.[xlix] Hromov also stated that Russian forces are deploying \"territorial troops\" to the Kherson Oblast frontline to assist with the redeployment effort.[l] Russian forces continued routine shelling of the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast and struck the Kherson Oblast Cardiology Dispensary in Kherson City.[li] Residents of Oleshky (just south of Kherson City on the east bank of the Dnipro River) reported shelling in the settlement on both December 28 and 29, and the Ukrainian General Staff and other Ukrainian sources claimed that Russian forces shelled Oleshky.[lii] Russian sources accused Ukrainian troops of striking Oleshky.[liii] ISW has not observed any visual confirmation of Ukrainian forces in Oleshky, and it is unclear why Russian troops would shell territory they control. Geolocated footage from December 28 shows a Ukrainian drone striking a Russian ammunition truck near Oleshky, indicating that Ukrainian forces have recently targeted Russian positions in Oleshky.[liv]\n\nUkrainian officials provided conflicting reports regarding the situation in Zaporizhia Oblast on December 29. Hromov reported that there is currently no significant threat of the creation of a Russian offensive group in the Zaporizhia direction, which is consistent with previous observations made by Ukrainian officials that Russian units that are currently forming in the Zaporizhia direction do not have offensive capabilities.[lv] However, following Hromovs statement, the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces are concentrating their efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Zaporizhia direction, which is an inflection in the language the General Staff typically uses that describes Russian actions in this area as defensive.[lvi] ISW has not observed any indicators that Russian forces are preparing for or conducting offensive operations in Zaporizhia Oblast.[lvii] The reason for the discrepancies between the General Staff and Hromovs statements is unclear.\n\nUkrainian forces continue to strike Russian concentration areas in Zaporizhia Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian strikes hit various Russian military assets and personnel concentrations in Tokmak, Tytove, Chernihivka, Polohy, and Berdyansk on December 27.[lviii] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Ukrainian forces struck a Russian personnel concentration in Berdyansk on December 28.[lix]\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) stated that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu held the first meeting of the Kremlins mobilization working group on December 29.[lx] First Vice-Speaker of the Russian Federation Council Andrey Turchak reportedly serves as head of the working group, which enables representatives from both Russian houses of parliament, all major Russian political parties, leading war correspondents and milbloggers, and leaders of unspecified public organizations to discuss mobilization policies with MoD representatives.[lxi] The Kremlin likely hopes to use the working group to minimize criticism of authorities mishandlings of mobilization. Turchak claimed that the Russian MoD is \"ready\" to work in conjunction with other actors.[lxii] However, public acknowledgment of and a forum for discussion of MoD mistakes will likely become a further source of friction for the MoD. Shoigu alleged on December 29 that Russian officials had already managed to solve almost all mobilization problems quite quickly but conceded that mobilized soldiers needs require \"constant long-term attention\" and coordination between authorities of all levels.[lxiii] A Russian milblogger incorrectly stated on December 27, and ISW therefore incorrectly reported, that the working group would meet on December 28.[lxiv]\n\nRussian authorities continue efforts to punish mobilized soldiers who refuse to fight and to publicize threats to mobilization dodgers. Russian news sources reported on December 27 and 28 that three Russian parliamentary deputies have proposed or are drafting bills to limit the rights of men who fled Russia since February 24, particularly while eligible for mobilization. The proposals include confiscation of property, restriction of the right to work in public service, and formal designation as \"foreign agents.\"[lxv] Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev posted on December 28 that Russia should ban the \"traitors\" who left the country since February 24 from returning to Russia.[lxvi] A group of wives of mobilized soldiers from Volgograd filed a complaint with the military prosecutors office on December 26 that Russian commanders are holding 9 mobilized soldiers who refuse to fight in a \"prison for refuseniks\" in Amvrosiivka, Donetsk Oblast.[lxvii]\n\nRussian authorities continue to invest in long-term Russian force generation capacity and long-term financial promises to soldiers contingent on the retention of territory currently occupied by Russia. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed an order on December 23 to establish military training centers in 16 Russian universities across Russia.[lxviii] The head of Russian-occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, claimed on December 29 that his administration approved the provision of land plots from occupied Crimea to certain soldiers fighting in Ukraine.\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to face partisan pressure in occupied territories. Kherson Oblast Administration Advisor Serhiy Khlan reported on December 29 that likely Ukrainian partisans blew up the Nova Kakhovka occupation police department head Yehor Kuzakov.[lxix] Khlan noted that he is awaiting additional information and official confirmation of the incident.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to intensify law enforcement crackdowns in occupied areas in response to Ukrainian partisan activities. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on December 29 that Russian occupation authorities carried out another search raid for Ukrainian partisans in Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast.[lxx] The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported on December 29 that Russian occupation officials are seeking to arrest as many saboteurs as possible and are exaggerating their successes in order to give favorable reports to Russian officials in Moscow.[lxxi] A Russian source claimed on December 29 that the Federal Security Service (FSB) detained a Ukrainian resident in occupied-Kherson Oblast under accusations that he was transmitting information to Ukraines Security Service (SBU) on the movements of Russian forces.[lxxii]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are facing pressure from farmers in occupied territories.[lxxiii] A Russian source claimed on December 29 that Ukrainian farmers in occupied Kherson Oblast face a lack of geocadastre (territorial land management) bodies and unprepared irrigation systems that are preventing them from resuming agricultural activities throughout Kherson Oblast.[lxxiv] The Russian source claimed on December 29 that Ukrainian farmers are requesting that Kherson Occupation Administration Head Vladimir Saldo urgently address threats to the upcoming agricultural season as Russian occupation authorities have failed to provide the promised support to Ukrainian farmers.[lxxv]\n\nRussian occupation authorities are continuing to seize and repurpose civilian infrastructure in occupied territories for military use. The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on December 29 that Russian forces are concentrating troops and military equipment in abandoned schools in occupied territories.[lxxvi] The Ukrainian Resistance Center also reported on December 29 that Russian forces are using the basements of schools along the frontlines in the Vasylivskyi Raion, Zaporizhia Oblast, to deliberately stage provocations and create propaganda.[lxxvii] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on December 29 that Russian forces are continuing to use civilian healthcare networks in occupied territories to treat wounded servicemen and private military mercenaries.[lxxviii] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on December 29 that Russian forces seized a hospital in Bilovodsk, Luhansk Oblast, to treat more than 100 wounded Russian and Wagner servicemen and that Russian forces have placed approximately 120 wounded servicemen at a civilian hospital in Tokmak, Zaporizhia Oblast.[lxxix] The Ukrainian General Staff also reported on December 29 that Russian forces have redirected medical workers and equipment from Kalinin Donetsk Regional Hospital to Mariupol.[lxxx]\n\nRussian officials continued efforts to consolidate administrative and economic control of occupied territories on December 29. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an order on December 29 establishing Russian-appointed prosecutors in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia Oblasts.[lxxxi] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on December 29 that Russian occupation authorities are incentivizing Ukrainian citizens to accept Russian passports in exchange for social payments.[lxxxii] Kherson Occupation Administration Head Vladimir Saldo stated on December 29 that external management of enterprises in occupied territories is irrelevant as all enterprises are now state-owned.[lxxxiii] Saldo also stated on December 29 that managers of now state-owned enterprises will only continue their employment if they fulfill obligations set by occupation officials.[lxxxiv] Saldo stated that approximately 26,000 enterprises are registered in Kherson Oblast and that Russian officials are working to re-register them within the Russian legal framework.[lxxxv]\n\nISW will continue to report daily observed indicators consistent with the current assessed most dangerous course of action (MDCOA): a renewed invasion of northern Ukraine possibly aimed at Kyiv.\n\nISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low. This new section in the daily update is not in itself a forecast or assessment. It lays out the daily observed indicators we are using to refine our assessments and forecasts, which we expect to update regularly. Our assessment that the MDCOA remains unlikely has not changed. We will update this header if the assessment changes.\n\nObserved indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nUkrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksiy Hromov stated on December 29 that the Russian military plans to transform the Machulishchy airfield in Belarus into a key Russian \"logistics hub\" and that unspecified work is ongoing at the Belarusian Machulishchy, Baranovichi, Luninets airfields, and their adjacent infrastructure to support Russian forces.[lxxxvi] This indicator can support the MDCOA as well as the Kremlins longstanding campaign to establish a permanent Russian military presence in Belarus.[lxxxvii]\n\nObserved ambiguous indicators for MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) posted a video on December 29 showing unspecified Russian Western Military District elements (possibly of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division, 1st Guards Tank Army) conducting tactical training with Belarusian personnel at an unspecified training ground in Belarus.[lxxxviii] The Russian MoD reiterated that Russian and Belarusian units form a combined Regional Grouping of Forces within the Union State.[lxxxix]\n\nGeolocated video footage posted on December 28 shows a train with Russian military equipment, including tanks and trucks, moving west from the Krasny Bereg railway station in Gomel Oblast.[xc]\n\nUkrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksiy Hromov stated on December 29 that the Russian military has 11,000 personnel and 400 pieces of equipment currently deployed in Belarus.[xci] Hromov stated that 22,000 Russian personnel are currently deployed in Belarus, Bryansk, and Kursk oblasts and that this is half as many personnel (45,500) as Russia deployed to this area before the February 24 invasion. Hromov stated that even if all Belarusian combat forces join Russia, Russia would have only about 30,000 personnel. This is an ambiguous indicator because Russian forces do not need to replicate the February 2022 force array to conduct a diversionary attack against northern Ukraine. Russian commanders might also believe, likely mistakenly, that a smaller force could succeed this winter where a larger one failed in 2022.\n\nObserved counter-indicators for the MDCOA in the past 24 hours:\n\nUkrainian General Staff Deputy Chief Oleksiy Hromov stated on December 29 that Russia removed all the artillery shells and MLRS ammunition that Russia established in Belarus before the February 24 invasion and that Belarus has limited capabilities to resupply a Russian offensive group with ammunition.[xcii]\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reiterated that it has not observed Russian forces in Belarus forming a strike group as of December 29.[xciii]\n\nDeputy Ukrainian Defense Minister Hanna Malyar stated on December 29 that persistent reports about a possible Russian invasion from Belarus are part of a Russian information operation to demoralize Ukrainians.[xciv]\n\nUkraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate Chief Kyrylo Budanov said on December 29 that Russian activity in Belarus is part of an information operation to divert Ukrainian forces away from Ukraines south and east.[xcv] Budanov also stated that he has not observed Russian forces preparing to invade Kyiv City or northern Ukraine.[xcvi]\n\nHead of Ukraines State Border Guards Service Serhiy Deyneko stated on December 28 that Russian and Belarusian forces do not have real capacities to attack Ukraine and that Ukrainian authorities have not observed Russian forces in Belarus forming a strike group. He also stated that Belarus 10,000 combat personnel are not capable of attacking Ukraine.[xcvii]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

                "cc_text": "I have been a perpetual believer in the power of words.\n\nWords carry energy to heal, hurt, comfort, anger, educate, inspire, incite violence or strengthen bonds. The influence is manifold, for both, a community and an individual, gathering insight, learning, and unlearning via audio, video, or text; watering our emotional and intellectual responses to what we consume by reading, writing, hearing, and speaking. Imagine if we all, with our varied life experiences, nationalities, and learnt languages, became intentional, critical, and encouraging with our words, and the kind of impact and explosive stories we would create through the magnanimous power of spoken and written expression.\n\nThis year witnessed a plethora of pedagogical, compelling, entertaining, and informational conversations, colourfully centred on design and architecture, crystalising our present perceptions of the global creative disciplines at large, confirming our beliefs, opposing age-old ideas, and catalysing fresh ones. As a global media house, STIR rounds up the best of interviews partaken in 2022, conversing with and learning from leading architects, designers, and creative professionals from the world over, who pushed boundaries, addressed issues, and questioned the status quo through discourse, debate, and dialogue.\n\n1. The woman in the BIG chair: Sheela Maini Sgaard\n\nSheela Maini Sgaard, CEO and Partner at Bjarke Ingels Group Image: Flemming Leitorp\n\nOn International Women's Day 2022, STIR spoke with the woman who has been critical in shaping one of the worlds most powerful architectural firms: the Bjarke Ingels Group.\n\nVocal. Vulnerable. Audacious. Understanding. Breaking the bias is perhaps about embracing the beauty of all parts of being a woman. At BIG, Sheela Maini Sgaard is the CEO and Partner. Thirteen years after walking into Bjarke's Copenhagen office with no experience in the architectural business, she today commands a team that drives arguably the most ambitious and game-changing firm in the industry.\n\n2. In conversation with Aric Chen on the role of cultural institutions\n\nThe role of cultural institutions: STIR in conversation with Aric Chen Video: Courtesy of STIR; Image: Courtesy of Het Nieuwe Instituut\n\nWhat is the role and importance of cultural institutions? Many institutions are in the process of reimagining their purpose and reflecting on their internal processes. In a fascinating conversation with Aric Chen, who was recently appointed as the General and Artistic Director of Het Nieuwe Instituut (HNI) in Rotterdam, we explore the shifting paradigm of institutional practices and contemporary design.\n\nChen explains in great detail the importance of the archive, referencing the past, but at the same time emphasises the value of decolonising the archive as well. He refers to the vocabulary as having an asterisk, as an indicator of an ongoing discourse of the words connotations.\n\n3. Then, Now, and Next: A conversation with Alberto Alessi\n\nThen, Now, and Next: A conversation with Alberto Alessi Video: Courtesy of STIR; Alberto's portrait by Toni Thorimbert\n\nWhen Alberto Alessi joined the family business in July 1970, after he graduated from law school, he found the factory a bit too dark and too grey. The company, founded in 1921, by his grandfather Giovanni Alessi who later handed the baton to his son (and Albertos father) Carlo Alessi, is today made up of an eclectic range of home products which includes tableware, cooking utensils, watches, furnishing accessories, lighting, and small domestic appliances. Albertos entry into the company ushered in a new era of joy as the 76-year-old 'entrepreneur by mistake' spearheaded the inclusion of international designers into the Alessi universe. The collaborations resulted in thousands of products over the decades, many of which have become icons of contemporary design.\n\nThe President of Alessi Spa engaged in a conversation with STIR, traversing the 'Then, Now, and Next' of the iconic Italian design company, and his own place in it.\n\n4. Mise-en-scne with STIR: The best of film architecture at Oscars 2022\n\nIn a series of interviews with the 2022 Oscar nominees for production design, STIR delves into the best of film architecture this year Image: Courtesy of STIR; Portraits: Courtesy of respective designers\n\nThe red carpet, celebrity entrances, the sharp gowns and tuxedos, and exuberant stage scenography are just a part of the associated glitz of the Oscars, a celebration of the best of global cinema. Through delving into exquisite detail and architectural theory, both for tangible and intangible spaces, this years fantastical sets decorated alien worlds, period pieces, musicals, and even entirely implausible spatialities.\n\nThe overt and definitive architectural character of some of this years films caught our eye and in a series of conversations with these Oscar-nominated production designers, we attempt to decipher the genesis, the visualisation, and the process of bringing these fantastical worlds to life through Mise-en-scne with STIR, a carnival of stimulating conversations with Oscar winner Patrice Vermette, and his equally deserving fellow nominees Stefan Dechant, Grant Major, and Tamara Deverell.\n\n5. Making design actionable with Beatrice Leanza at Milan Design Week 2022\n\nMaking design actionable with Italian curator, critic, and author Beatrice Leanza Image: Courtesy of Platforme 10\n\nSalone del Mobile.Milano had this to say about their 2022 editions powerful programme\"We now understand only too well progress, inevitably, has to be sustainable. We have to pull together and renew our serious and generous ecological efforts. Design, lateral thinking, creativity, taking a critical approach, openness training and knowledge exchangeall characteristics inherent in those involved with the world of designare the main drivers for accelerating the evolution of a more equitable society and a more sustainable world.\"\n\nBeatrice Leanza, one of the three powerful female curators of this year's panel of stirring conversations addressed these pressing issues, of facing the uncertainty of the times we live in and reflecting upon concrete actions for a better tomorrow, with design as a catalyst for improvement. As a cultural strategist, curator, writer and critic with a background in Asian studies who was based in Beijing for 17 years, Leanza spoke to STIR about actionable design, agency, and the potential of the intersection of sustainable design and technology as the crucible of societal empowerment.\n\n6. Tatiana Bilbao on creating architecture that enhances the human experience\n\nIn conversation with STIR, the Mexican architect discussed her ideas for a future city, creating stronger communities through design, and questioning social and spatial hierarchies Video: Courtesy of STIR; Image: Ana Hop\n\nElke Krasny, an Austrian cultural and architectural theorist, in her work Critical Care: Architecture and Urbanism for Broken Planet, along with Angelika Fitz, establishes how \"Architecture provides a primary form of care.\" An interpretation of this ideology is at the core of Tatiana Bilbao ESTUDIO's work. Tatiana Bilbao founded her eponymous studio in 2004 after her role as an Advisor in the Ministry of Development and Housing of the Government of the Federal District of Mexico City.\n\nIn conversation with STIR, the Mexican architect expresses her disdain for architecture that is informed by capitalist structures and stresses the importance of designing towards creating social justice, stronger communities, and a healthy ecosystem.\n\n7. Luminaries of our Times Lidewij Edelkoort\n\nSTIR in conversation with Dutch trend forecaster Lidewij Edelkoort Video: Courtesy of STIR; Li's portrait by Thirza Schaap\n\nRemarkably prescient, Lidewij Edelkoorts comments in early March 2020 on the likely impact of COVID-19, went viral. Before coronavirus was declared a pandemic and most countries went into lockdown, Edelkoort foretold that the world would see a \"quarantine of consumption.\" She advised people to stop planning mega-events, that air travel would reduce significantly, and that the virus would bring fundamental changes in lifestyles, giving humanity the opportunity to slow down and reset goals and needs. The accuracy of that forecast has added even more heft to her already formidable reputation of being one of the finest trend forecasters globally.\n\nOver the last 50 years, she has projected shifts not only for the fashion industry but for design and lifestyle, predicting form, materials, and colour along with important social and cultural currents. Edelkoort, ensconced in a hotel in Florence, where she is establishing a radical, sustainable textile master at Polimoda, expounded on a range of issues from memories of her first fashion forecast in this interview with STIR, to thoughts on the metaverse, and much more.\n\n8. FIFA Arenas: Lusail Stadium by Foster + Partners in Lusail, Qatar\n\nFIFA Arenas: Lusail Stadium by Foster + Partners in Lusail City, Qatar Video: Courtesy of STIR and Foster + Partners; Image: Nigel Young / Foster + Partners\n\nResembling a 'burnished golden vessel', whose gleaming diagrid faade design features geometric motifs in anodised metal, the Lusail Stadium by London-based Foster + Partners has been described as the \"centrepiece\" of all the venues developed for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The glimmering new landmark with a capacity of 80,000 became a focal point of the new urban development to the north of Doha. While speaking to STIR, Angus Campbell, Senior Partner, and Doretta Bevilacqua Gilkes, Partner at Foster + Partners, elaborate on their 13-year-long journey towards achieving the lofty goals set out at the commencement of the project, outlining the intricacies of designing a venue fit to host footballs greatest spectaclethe 2022 FIFA World Cup final.\n\n9. STIR in conversation with Sumayya Vally, founder of Counterspace\n\nSTIR in conversation with Sumayya Vally (L); Liminal Identities in the Global South (R) Image: Mikhael Subotzky; Courtesy of Counterspace\n\nBased out of Johannesburg, South Africa, Sumayya Vallys design, research, and pedagogical practice Counterspace is an interesting new expression of what a contemporary architectural practice can be. While known for her design of the 20th Serpentine Pavilion (2020/2021), in London, Vallys methodology has been heralded as one with the potential to shape the future by questioning the canon of architecture. She has recently worked on initiating and developing Support Structures for Support Structures, a fellowship programme launched at the Serpentine Gallery, designed to facilitate the artists and collectives who support the community through their work.\n\nIn a conversation with STIR, the young architect and pedagogical thinker takes us through her process, elaborating on the genesis of Counterspace, and the more recent Counterparts.\n\n10. Hanif Kara in conversation with STIR on expanding the spectrum of design\n\nSTIR in conversation with Professor Hanif Kara (OBE) Video: Courtesy of STIR; Image: Courtesy of AKT II\n\nThe fractal, fluidic and fantastical nature of contemporary architecture is only possible because of the careful alliance between creative forms and experimental engineering. With 40 years of experience, Professor Hanif Kara, the co-founder of London-based design-led engineering practice AKT II, is a strong voice propagating the importance of intersectional practice. In recognition of his services in architecture, engineering, and education, Professor Kara received an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire award (OBE) in the Queens New Year Honours List. In a conversation with STIR, he elaborates on what citation and recognition mean to him while expanding on the ethos of AKT II.\n\n11. Gene Sherman on exploring architecture and fashion as forms of cultural expression\n\nAustralian cultural figure, collector, academic, gallerist and philanthropist, Dr Gene Sherman AM Image: Courtesy of SCCI\n\nGene Sherman AM, a collector, academic, art specialist and gallerist has been hailed \"a beacon in the Australian cultural landscape,\" and for fostering an architectural culture in Sydney. At their core, Shermans events and discussions are issue-based and cross-disciplinary, congregating architects with filmmakers, fashion designers, writers, human rights lawyers, and more. Shermans foundation relays that she has undoubtedly made her mark and proven that architecture deserves its place within public discourse alongside the arts, in Australia, and beyond.\n\nHer approach to architecture as a \"culturally informed outsider\" has enabled her pursuits, fame, and intent, to move the dial on merging these contemporary disciplines, redefining their intents via thought-provoking combinations and discourse. Speaking with STIR, Sherman highlights her vision of the SCCI Fashion and Architecture Programme 2022, as its Founder, Executive and Artistic Director, prior to retiring from engaging in public events.\n\n12. Palinda Kannangara on the architectural ethos of Sri Lanka, and the site as narrator\n\nSri Lankan architect Palinda Kannangara in conversation with STIR Image: Palindas portrait: Courtesy of Palinda Kannangara Architects; Artists Retreat, Pittugala: Sebastian Posingis\n\nAmong several countries with remarkable architecture in the Southeast Asian belt, each with their own ethos and indigenous methods that have led to the definition of a style, it is perhaps the island nation of Sri Lanka. A near-holy reverence to the site, and the extension of the architectural process as essentially a dialogue between the architect and the site, is what may be argued to be at the heart of Sri Lankas tropical modernism.\n\nRenowned homegrown architect Palinda Kannangara spoke to STIR over a course of several months, while this country of inimitable beauty and wondrous terrains overcame a political crisis through a peoples movement. Kannangara opened up about his acclaimed practice and his personal musings on architecture, staying locally rooted with respect to Sri Lanka, and all that the land has endowed him with, leading to a veritable style that symbolically carries the mantle from Geoffrey Bawa.\n\n13. Perusing 'The Inventory of Life' with French designer Mathieu Lehanneur\n\nSTIR in conversation with French designer and creator Mathieu Lehanneur Video: Courtesy of STIR; Images: Lionel Gasperini (L) and Felipe Ribon (R)\n\nTo see the world through the eyes of French designer and multidisciplinary creator Mathieu Lehanneur is to comprehend and revel in his radical, creative, instinctive and giddily nerdy ideas of what design is, and can be honed into, as an agency. Described as a \"champion of intellectual agility in the field of contemporary design\" by Paola Antonelli, Senior Curator, Department of Architecture and Design, MoMA-NY, Lehanneur is fascinated with nature, science, the human psyche, and the real world, giving into an investigative curiosity that enables him to learn, and create for our complex species.\n\nThe ambidextrous industrial designer joined us over a Zoom call from his \"factory\" in France, his animated gestures giving away his egalitarian, and fiercely independent nature. We spoke at length on his now concluded solo exhibition curated by independent design curator, consultant, critic and author Maria Cristina Didero, The Inventory of Life at the Triennale de Milano 2022, comprising four succinct installations State of the World, 50 Seas, Live/ Leave, and How Deep is Time.\n\n14. Ben Evans discusses the role of design festivals in cities\n\nSTIR in conversation with Ben Evans CBE, Director of the London Design Festival, and Executive Director of London Design Biennale Video: Courtesy of STIR\n\nLondon is a melting pot of people, cultures, ideas, and perhaps most importantly, activators. These activators manifest in different ways. Sometimes they are organisations that cast a wide net of support. Sometimes they are individual people that connect the points of creative output and ground them in the reality of their context. These translators of culture are an important aspect of any cultural and design fair. In relation to the city of London, there are perhaps two key design events that come to mind. The first is the annual London Design Festival and the second is the London Design Biennale which takes place every alternate year.\n\nTo better understand the curatorial approach and the impact of these two events, Amit Gupta, Founder and Editor-in-Chief of STIR, spoke to Ben Evans CBE, Director of the London Design Festival, and Executive Director of London Design Biennale. Evans established the Festival in 2003 with Co-Founder Sir John Sorrell. Over the course of the conversation, Evans not only talked about spearheading city-wide creative festivals but engaged in a deeper discussion about how these festivals impact the city not just in economics but also in terms of engaging the public.\n\n15. Adam Nathaniel Furman and Adam Kaasa on 'Queer Spaces', narratives, and expression\n\nAdam Nathaniel Furman in conversation with Dr Adam Kaasa on their new book, Queer Spaces Video: Courtesy of STIR; Adam Furmans portrait: Gareth Gardner\n\nIn a sensitively strewn conversation, artist and designer Adam Nathaniel Furman speaks with Dr Adam Kaasa of the Royal College of Art and founder of Theatrum Mundi on their new book Queer Spaces, an essential history, and notions of refuge in a queer ecosystem.\n\nAcross the 200+ spaces that the book lovingly catalogues, there must be certain common spatial factors that would bind the varied selection of spaces some permanent, some transient, and some increasingly intimate. As architects now transitioned into making basal enquiries into the spaces we write about, the conditioning called for motioning the narrative around referential styles and statements. Amid the enlightening conversation between these two immensely reputed London-based practitioners and professionals, a talking point initiated by Dr Kaasa observed how this atlas of LGBTQIA+ spaces began and ended, corroborated as completely intentional narrative bookends by Furman.\n\n16. Sagi Haviv on creating an icon of permanence for Warner Bros. Discovery\n\nSTIR in conversation with Sagi Haviv of Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv on the new graphic identity for Warner Bros. Discovery Video: Courtesy of STIR; Sagis Image: Courtesy of Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv\n\nIndestructible. Foolproof. Ironclad. Adjectives of fortitude and solidity that better define an encampment than a logo, an identity for a brand. But a conversation with Sagi Haviv, one-third of the New York-based Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv lent a different perspective to that notion. \"We are concerned with permanence,\" stated a pensive Haviv, termed the 'logo prodigy' by The New Yorker, during our conversation on the new identity design for what can only be termed a rarity in the corporate entertainment worlda merger between Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia by AT&T.\n\n17. Bridging the virtual and tangible with digital artist and designer, Andrs Reisinger\n\nDigital artist and designer Andrs Reisinger Image: Andrs Image by Anna Huix; Product Images: Courtesy of Reisinger Studio\n\nWhen approaching this interview and discussion with the Barcelona-based artist-designer and virtual creator Andrs Reisinger, we will admit that the \"unclassifiability\" of his worknot fitting into bracketsis what proved to be the most attractive aspect of his repertoire.\n\nIf anything, the dawn of the age of the NFT has further emboldened these brackets, and the advent of the metaverse firmly stands to make those boundaries even more fluid, even more limitless. And that confidence in adapting his creations to both worlds, both mediums, comes across firmly in Reisingers work. Carefully placed at a well-calculated precipice between both, constantly tugged by the two and yet planted in a realm in the midst, something Reisinger calls the \"emotional\" realm, his creations are his emancipation from the practicality of it all, and what comes after design.\n\n18. Design is about people, not chairs: Maria Cristina Didero at Salone del Mobile 2022\n\nMaria Cristina Didero, international curator, consultant, editor and author, as well as an expert in Italian Radical Design Image: Stefano Ferroni\n\n\"Design is all about people, not about chairs,\" Maria Cristina Didero exclaims, encapsulating what forms the credo of the Milan-based, independent design curator, author and journalist, working at the leading edge of the global design conversation. Focusing on how an object comes to be and the creators behind these as storytellers, instead of just the object itself, the fiery redhead forms part of a powerful, all-female trio leading the Talks programme at the just-opened, 60th chapter of the Salone del Mobile.Milano.\n\nWhat is it about the curatorial powerhouse brimming with humility and optimism, that allows her to click with design mavericks and young talents at the same time? STIR catches up with Didero ahead of her Talks curation, based on Sustainability: Three Different Episodes, discussing her lineup of creators who anchor themselves in pragmatic sustainability in design, how she plans to stir things up on the international design stage as the newly appointed Curatorial Director of Design Miami 2022, and more.\n\n19. Vinu Daniel feels at home with the brick\n\n(L R): Indian architect Vinu Daniel; IHA Residence, Trivandrum, Kerala, 2018 Image: Anand Jaju\n\nTalking to innovative architects is always an enlightening experience. There is no one way of creating buildings and every commission presents different sets of challenges and opportunities. Still, one would think there is a general sense of direction and a certain design methodology that architects rely on. Thats not how Vinu Daniel, the founder of Wallmakers in Trivandrum, the capital of the Indian west-coast state of Kerala, sees his mission; he strives at being uniquely specific to each site's needs. In our conversation over Zoom that follows a brief introduction, he told us, \"Your success is the worst thing that can happen to you as an architect because it takes your attention away from the new problem.\"\n\n20. The World Around's Beatrice Galilee on architecture's now, near, and next\n\nSTIR in conversation with Beatrice Galilee - writer, curator, cultural consultant, and co-founder of The World Around Video: Courtesy of STIR; Image: Courtesy of Beatrice Galilee and The World Around\n\nHeralding a particularly refreshing narrative space for architectural and design programming in modern curation, The World Around Summit, now in its third edition, presented some increasingly interesting frontrunners as part of its mission statement this year. With an idea to represent architectures \"now, near, and next,\" the summits curation of projects, initiatives, and even ongoing research proved to be a beacon for essential conversations in the field of architecture. At the forefront of it is Beatrice Galilee, Co-founder and Executive Director of the summit, who spoke to STIR about her interest in how modern discourse and intersectionality affect the practice of architecture across the globe.",

                "cc_text": "Following is the transcript of UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres press conference, in New York today:\n\nSecretary-General: I welcome this opportunity to gather one last time before the end of the year and I wish you and your families all the best for 2023. Our world faced many trials and tests in 2022 some familiar, others we might not have imagined just one year ago. There may be plenty of reasons for despair.\n\nGeopolitical divides have made global problem solving ever more difficult sometimes impossible. The cost-of-living crisis is hitting hard and inequalities are growing affecting the worlds women and girls the most. Most of the worlds poorest countries find themselves on what one could call, \"debt row\" staring down the abyss of insolvency and default. This year alone their debt service payments skyrocketed 35 per cent the largest increase in decades. The poor are getting poorer.\n\nThese and so many other challenges make some want to throw up their hands and give up on international problem solving and diplomacy. But, I end this year with one overriding conviction: This is not a time to sit on the sidelines, it is a time for resolve, determination, and yes even hope. Because despite the limitations and long odds, we are working to push back against despair, to fight back against disillusion and to find real solutions.\n\nNot perfect solutions not even always pretty solutions but practical solutions that are making a meaningful difference to peoples lives. Solutions that must put us on a pathway to a better, more peaceful future. The most recent example comes from just this morning, at 3 a.m.\n\nDelegates at the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal agreed on a new Global Biodiversity Framework. We are finally starting to forge a peace pact with nature. This Framework is an important step for determined diplomacy and I urge all countries to deliver.\n\nWe are also seeing a measure of progress to help address some, unfortunately not all, but some of the worlds festering conflicts. Much more, in any case, must be done in all situations. But, diplomacy has helped pull several conflicts from the brink.\n\nIn Ethiopia, efforts by the African Union to broker peace are a reason for hope. A cessation of hostilities and implementation agreements are in place. A pathway to assistance in the northern part of the country is emerging.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, diplomatic efforts led by Angola and the East African Community (EAC) have created a framework for political dialogue to resolve the crisis in the eastern region of the country.\n\nThe truce in Yemen has delivered real dividends for people. Since then, even if very fragile, there have been no major military operations in a conflict where innocent people have been paying the highest price. Civilian flights have resumed from Sanaa. Vital supplies are finally getting through the port of Hudaydah.\n\nAnd even in the brutal war in Ukraine, we have seen the power of determined, discreet diplomacy to help people and tackle unprecedented levels of global food insecurity. Despite ongoing challenges, the Black Sea Grain initiative to facilitate exports of food and fertilizers from Ukraine and a memorandum of understanding for unimpeded exports of Russian food and fertilizers to global markets are making a difference.\n\nOver 14 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs have been shipped from Black Sea ports in Ukraine. Russian wheat exports have also multiplied three-fold. A clear majority of wheat exports under the Black Sea Grain Initiative has been shipped to developing economies.\n\nThis includes some 380,000 metric tons transported by the World Food Programme (WFP) to support ongoing humanitarian operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. And the FAO Food Price Index declined for eight months in a row by around 15 per cent keeping millions of people across the globe from falling into extreme poverty. But, much work remains to be done. Food prices are still too high and access to fertilizers still too limited.\n\nWe will continue to strive around the clock to support the full implementation of these initiatives clarifying exemptions for food and fertilizer within the different sanction regimes, addressing indirect constraints, and pressing for greater efficiencies in the implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative to increase the volume of cargo being moved out of Ukraines ports. And we will not relent in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine. Peace in line with international law and the United Nations Charter.\n\nClimate change is another area where good news can be hard to find. We are still moving in the wrong direction. The global emissions gap is growing. The 1.5C goal is gasping for breath. National climate plans are falling woefully short. And yet, we are not retreating. We are fighting back. We are fighting back to help emerging economies shift away from coal and accelerate the renewable energy revolution.\n\nThis year, major multi-billion-dollar Just Energy Transition Partnerships were launched with Indonesia, South Africa and just last week, Viet Nam. We are fighting back to restore trust between North and South.\n\nThis year, COP27 delivered a groundbreaking pathway on the long-stalled issue of Loss and Damage. We are fighting back to cut through the fog of greenwashing. This year, our High-Level Expert Group launched a \"how-to\" guide on the credible implementation of net-zero pledges for businesses, investors, cities and regions.\n\nWe are fighting back to ensure protection plans for humanity in the face of worsening climate disasters and natural ecosystems. This year, we launched an action plan to cover every person in the world with early warning systems within five years.\n\nGoing forward, I will keep pushing for a Climate Solidarity Pact, in which all big emitters make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade in line with the 1.5C goal and ensure support for those who need it. There is no doubt that without it, the 1.5C goal will soon disappear. I have pulled no punches on the imperative for all of us to confront this existential threat. And I will not relent.\n\nSo today I am announcing that I will convene a Climate Ambition Summit in September 2023. I call on every leader to step up from Governments, business, cities and regions, civil society and finance. They must come with new, tangible and credible climate action to accelerate the pace of change. The invitation is open.\n\nBut, there is a price of entry and the price of entry is non-negotiable credible, serious and new climate action and nature-based solutions that will move the needle forward and respond to the urgency of the climate crisis must be presented. It will be a no-nonsense summit. No exceptions. No compromises. There will be no room for back-sliders, greenwashers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years.\n\nThe Climate Ambition Summit will be convened alongside a crucial gathering of world leaders to accelerate action at the midway point of the Sustainable Development Goals. I am more determined than ever to make 2023 a year for peace, a year for action.\n\nWe cant accept things as they are. We owe it to people to find solutions, to fight back and to act. At times, discreetly but always with determination we will fight back. To promote peace and security. To advance the Sustainable Development Goals and address inequalities. To reform a morally bankrupt international financial system. To ensure human rights for all as we mark next years 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And to deliver a livable planet to our children and grandchildren. Thank you.\n\n** Questions and Answers\n\nSecretary-General: Thank you. I'm at your disposal for questions.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you, sir. Before we go to questions, just to note, we have your interpreters if you want to ask a question in French or in Spanish. As always, I would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question, and we'll go to Edie to see if that works. Go ahead.\n\nQuestion: Mr. SecretaryGeneral, thank you very much, on behalf of the United Nations Correspondents Association, for doing this briefing. We all wish you and your family very happy holidays. We are reading, hearing reports of a buildup for a Soviet a Russian offensive in Ukraine with President [Vladimir V.] Putin going to Belarus today. Are you concerned about a new serious escalation of the war that possibly could bring in other countries? Because all of the political pundits are saying that Putin is going to ask for Belarus' help in launching a new offensive against Kyiv. And what would the implications be of any kind of new offensive that brings in outside countries?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, first of all, we have seen a massive escalation already with the heavy bombardment of electrical infrastructure, which, of course, is having a dramatic impact in the living conditions of the Ukrainians at the present moment, and we'll have terrible consequences for the future. So, we don't need more to talk about escalation. Obviously, we'll see what happens. There are many rumours about possible new offensives. My position is very clear. There is never a military solution for these problems, but it is important that a solution is in line with the UN Charter and with international law.\n\nQuestion: And can you explain, for people who don't really know what's in the UN Charter and international law, what that would mean?\n\nSecretary-General: The UN Charter is very clear in relation to the territorial integrity of countries to be respected. The UN Charter is very clear about the use of force not to be accepted in order to change, in any way, that territorial integrity.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Michelle?\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. Michelle Nichols from Reuters. Again, on Ukraine, can you please give us an indication of whether you see any opening at all for peace talks in Ukraine? And then, also, on the use of drones in Ukraine?\n\nSecretary-General: The use?\n\nQuestion: Of drones in Ukraine. You've come under some pressure from Western countries. You've come under pressure from Russia over whether to send an inspection team to Kyiv or not. You haven't sent one yet. Why not? Are you worried this could affect your diplomacy in other areas related to the conflict?\n\nSecretary-General: Look, first of all your first question, sorry, was? Before the drones?\n\nCorrespondent: Opening for peace talks.\n\nQuestion: Is there any opening for peace talks?\n\nSecretary-General: Oh, opening for peace talks, yes. I am not optimistic about the possibility of effective peace talks at the immediate future. I do believe that the military confrontation will go on, and I think we'll have still to wait a moment in which serious negotiations for peace will be possible. I don't see them in the immediate horizon. And that is why we are concentrating our efforts on different other aspects in relation to increased efficiency of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, in relation to starting the possibility of adding new components to that initiative, namely, in relation to ammonia exports. We are very interested in accelerating the exchange of prisoners of war and especially when we are approaching Christmas, and both sides celebrate Christmas in January. I think this would be something very important. I can't imagine how dramatic it is to be a prisoner of war in another country with the kind of war we are witnessing in the Ukraine. So, we'll go on trying to be useful, offering platforms of dialogue for these aspects to minimize suffering, but we have no illusions that a true peace negotiation would be possible in the immediate future. Of course, the bombardments that are taking place massively over electric infrastructure are something that is causing terrible trouble for the people. And in relation to the question we asked, we are looking into all the aspects of that question and in the broader picture of everything we are doing in the context of the war to determine if and when we should do what you have asked for.\n\nSpokesman: Benno?\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. Benno Schwinghammer with the German Press Agency. So, there has been a couple of coups and coup attempts this year, and there has been one coup attempt in a country which seemed unlikely, which is Germany.\n\nSecretary-General: Coup attempt in?\n\nSpokesman: In Germany.\n\nQuestion: Germany. There was a coup attempt in Germany by German right-wingers. And I wonder how you put this into perspective for the rise of right-wing ideology in Europe and North America right now. And then, about Elon Musk, Twitter is in the hands of a person that seems to have his very own definition of free speech and press freedom. In your opinion, is Elon Musk a threat to free speech? And\n\nSecretary-General: Elon Musk?\n\nQuestion: Is Elon Musk a threat to free speech? And would you be relieved?\n\nSpokesman: Is Elon Musk a threat to free speech?\n\nQuestion: And would you be relieved if he would actually step down as head of Twitter?\n\nSecretary-General: So, in relation to the first question, it has been demonstrated that the biggest threat of terrorism today, in Western countries, come from the extreme right, neoNazism and white supremacy. And I think we must be very clear and very firm in condemning every form of neoNazism and white supremacism, any form of antiSemitism, antiMuslim hatred that we are seeing multiplied in Western societies and also in other parts of the world. This is clearly a threat, and we must fight that threat with enormous determination. And what has happened in Germany is just one of the examples of this threat to namely, to democratic societies around the world. Second, I think there is a particular responsibility of social media platforms to preserve the freedom of press, and at the same time, to avoid hate speech and to avoid forms of extremism. And I would be particularly shocked if we would see the freedom of press being threatened, journalists not being allowed to do their work, and at the same time, hate speech proliferating. And so, obviously, my recommendation to whoever owns any platform is to make sure that the freedom of expression, especially of journalists, is respected and that hate speech, neoNazism, white supremacism, the other forms of extremism, do not find their way through those social platforms. I have no personal feelings in relation to who manages a platform. I'm very interested in about how the platform is managed.\n\nSpokesman: Sherwin?\n\nQuestion: SecretaryGeneral, thank you very much. You've just talked about how you are not optimistic about the effectiveness of peace talks as it relates to Ukraine. I wonder, sir, what you are optimistic about in your reference to 2023. What do you consider the lowhanging fruit for 2023 when you talk about these geopolitical divides? What can we see solved in the short term?\n\nSecretary-General: Now, first of all, when I said I do not see chances for a true peace negotiation in the immediate horizon, I did not mean the whole of 2023. I strongly hope that, in 2023, we'll be able to reach peace in Ukraine. The consequences for the Ukrainian people, the consequences for the Russian society and the economy, and the consequences for the global economy, especially for developing countries, with high prices of food and energy and with all the other difficulties that compound those high prices, I mentioned debt increase. I mentioned lack of fiscal space and the dramatic situation of increased inequalities that the developing countries are suffering. All these are reasons for us to do everything possible to make a peace solution happen before the end of 2023.\n\nSpokesman: James Bays, and then we'll go to Pam.\n\nQuestion: SecretaryGeneral, as this is your endofyear press conference, I'd like to take stock of where we are with regard to Ukraine. In terms of the history of the UN and your time as SecretaryGeneral, this is clearly one of the worst global crises. So, can I ask you, how much of a challenge has a war started by a permanent member of the Security Council been for the United Nations? And in your view, how well has the UN fared?\n\nSecretary-General: The UN is a complex organization that has different dimensions and different parts. Obviously, for the Security Council, this war has been a very dramatic factor of inefficiency. I will recall that not even the Black Sea Grain Initiative could be welcome because the Security Council couldn't approve anything in relation to the war. But, this war has demonstrated the enormous value of humanitarian action led by UN and UN agencies. What has been done to minimize the suffering of the Ukrainian people is absolutely remarkable, not only the UN, of course, the civil society, national and international in all its dimensions, and the people of Ukraine in itself. And on the other hand, these have demonstrated that the UN is probably the only platform that was able to seriously talk with both sides to try to solve not the war, unfortunately, but some specific problems that have dramatic impacts at global level. The questions related to the food crisis are a good example, which means that, without the UN, there probably would not be any other entity able to establish a dialogue with both parties and with other actors. Let's not forget the recent decision of the European Council in relation to the fertilizers. Without the UN, I don't think it would have been possible to establish the partial limited agreements that existed in the war of Ukraine that did not solve the problem of the war but that contributed to minimize the dramatic consequences of the war in Ukraine and in the rest of the world.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Pam? And then we'll go to Dezhi.\n\nCorrespondent: Thank you, Steph. Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. It's Pamela Falk from\n\nSecretary-General: Oh, sorry.\n\nCorrespondent: No, no, that's all right. From CBS News.\n\nSecretary-General: With the masks, I was a bit\n\nCorrespondent: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSecretary-General: You have no mask, but the wearing of the masks, and I was puzzled.\n\nQuestion: Thank you. It is the end of the year. On the biggerpicture, endoftheyear questions, largely because of Ukraine, many critics feel the UN there's something moving in the front of the room, but we'll ignore it.\n\nSecretary-General: The war is?\n\nCorrespondent: Sorry. Oh, good. Yay. Nice job. Good job, Michelle. It was too distracting.\n\nSpokesman: A girl from the outback, yeah.\n\nCorrespondent: All right.\n\nSecretary-General: We could have a debate\n\nQuestion: How do you feel about cleaning up the UN?\n\nSecretary-General: We could have a debate about how we were rescued by this threat or if there was a threat to biodiversity. Which means there are always two ways to look at the same thing.\n\nCorrespondent: Yes, it's good to know that animals are existing.\n\nSecretary-General: Yeah.\n\nQuestion: All right. Onto the next sorry. It was right in front of our eyes. So, on how to deal with the UN?\n\nSecretary-General: How to deal with UN?\n\nQuestion: With the UN. Not cleanliness. In terms of the war, many critics feel that it's time for a change at the Security Council and including P5 members the United States is on board to try to move things forward and feel that that is part the biggest part of the problem in terms of the UN not being fit for purpose for war and peace, although it does very well on humanitarian aid. What is your feeling about reforming the UN at this point in order to deal better with this major war we see? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, we have done many reforms in the areas of responsibility of the Secretariat and the UN agencies, and I think that the effectiveness of the response in relation to the humanitarian consequences of the war demonstrates that those reforms were positive. I mean, if you look, also, the way our country teams are working today in a much better and more effective way than just a few years ago, there are reforms of the UN that are taking place. But of course, the crucial aspect being discussed is in relation to the reform of the Security Council, and I would say the revitalization of the General Assembly and the strengthening of ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council). Now, we have witnessed some important progress in the revitalisation of the General Assembly. Let's not forget that now any veto in the Security Council leads to a discussion in the General Assembly and to the explanation of the reasons of the veto. This is a very important change in the relation between the two bodies. But, of course, the central questions are related to the composition of the Security Council and to the right of veto. Now, these are matters for Member States. The Secretariat has no influence in these negotiations, but I think that, during our General Assembly session in September, for the first time, I heard from the United States and from Russia, clearly, the indication that they were in favour of an enlargement of the number of permanent members of the Security Council. There was, from France and UK, some time ago, a proposal for some restrictions in the use of the right of veto. But, I remain pessimistic about the possibility of the right of veto to be seriously put into question. Let's not forget that we need to reform the Security Council, two thirds of the vote of the General Assembly, plus the five positive votes of the five members of the Security Council. So, I think that there is now space for a much more serious discussion in relation to the Security Council reform. I think that the possibility of enlarging the Security Council is now seriously on the table. I'm still not optimistic about [reforming] the right of veto. Thank you.\n\nCorrespondent: Thank you.\n\nSpokesman: Dezhi? And then we'll\n\nQuestion: SecretaryGeneral, this is Dezhi Xu with China Central Television. Just one brief question. Last time you were here, you talk about you want the Black Sea Grain deal be extended and expanded. Now it's being extended. What's your imagination of an expanded grain deal? And we know that Russian side has been criticizing and quite vocal about the fertilizer and foods from Russian side to export to the rest of the world. And what's your response to their criticism and how the UN help the fertilizer and food from Russia to export?\n\nSecretary-General: Our response to the criticism is action, and I believe that two very important things were achieved. One was in the core repair but in close association with the European Council that took place last week. There was a set of derogations that will allow the Russian companies that do the exports and some of them have some links to personalities that were in the sanctions regime that will allow those companies to move their funds for the purpose of exported food and fertilizers. This was remarkable progress, and I believe that there is a recognition that the UN had a role on it. On the other hand, you remember that there was a number of fertilizers that were stuck in several European harbours. There was a donation by the companies owning those fertilizers for the UN to be able to move them. It was possible now to move a first ship from Rotterdam to Malawi I mean to Mozambique to go to Malawi, and we have now inspections concluded in the other quantities that exist in Rotterdam and in Antwerp and in Estonia, and the exports were already authorized. These are noncommercial transactions because these are donations. But, of course, you need to find the ships. You need to find the insurance, and you need to find the way to distribute, and we have the support of the World Bank for that purpose. And Latvia, that has 190,000 tons of fertilizers, has also agreed inspections are taking place has also agreed to that movement. The problem of that movement is that, if you have potash, you cannot just put potash on the land. You need to mix. So, we are working with World Bank very seriously and with potential other donors in order to be able to create some forms of mixing fertilizers to be able to distribute them effectively to countries in need, because you just cannot move 190,000 tons of potash and distribute them, because you cannot use the potash if it is not associated with nitrogen and phosphate. So, it's a lot of work that is being done, which demonstrates our firm commitment, our firm commitment, to make sure that the Memorandum of Understanding that we have signed with the Russian Federation is effectively implemented.\n\nQuestion: Hows the expansion?\n\nSecretary-General: Sorry?\n\nQuestion: How's the expansion? How's the expansion? You talked about the expansion last time.\n\nSecretary-General: Oh, I mean, we would like as I said, we would like to see the possibility of increase the volume of exports. There is a question about the number of inspections that we would like to see increased. At the same time, we believe it would be an interesting development if we could have exports of ammonia through these harbours. And obviously, there are other harbours that might, one day, be considered depending on the situation evolves. But, we will spare no efforts to take profit of all opportunities. But, at the present moment, we are totally engaged with the consolidation of the present agreement and in making sure that we do, in relation to the Memorandum of Understanding, everything for the especially the fertilizer market to be, I would say, enlarged, clearly enlarged. We have a situation in which the price of fertilizers was 250 per cent of what it was before COVID. And for many countries, if fertilizers are not available in quantity and price, it means that there will be less food production in 2023. And so, in 2022, we had enough food. It was not well distributed. If we don't solve and I think now we are on the way to entirely solve it. If we don't solve the problem of fertilizers, we might then have, in 2023, a problem of lack of food.\n\nSpokesman: Maggie and then Clhia.\n\nQuestion: SecretaryGeneral, it's Margaret Besheer with Voice of America. I'd like to ask you about the protests in Iran. You haven't been terribly vocal on them, but in the meantime, the authorities have been escalating their crackdown. Two protesters have been executed. Hundreds, thousands, maybe, have been jailed. And over the weekend, a prominent actress was also arrested. What's your message to the Government of Iran and to the protesters?\n\nSecretary-General: No, it is very clear that it is totally unacceptable the way in which Iran has reacted to the demonstrations, and we are witnessing massive violations of human rights that we strongly condemn, and the [United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] is very actively in relation to that. I, myself, had also the opportunity to raise the issue directly with the Iranian authorities, independently of the clear position we have about the situation that, as I mentioned, is totally unacceptable and especially because it's very much linked to questions of gender equality and gender equality is, as you know, a central objective of my exercise of my responsibilities.\n\nQuestion: Could you just tell us when you raised it with them, when you raised it?\n\nSecretary-General: Immediately when I was visited by the President that came\n\nSpokesman: During the GA.\n\nSecretary-General: It was the first time in September.\n\nQuestion: But, that's when they started. You haven't raised it again?\n\nSecretary-General: Yes. No, of course. I mean, we had several other moments, but it just since the beginning and our position is very clear. There is no hint of any doubt about that.\n\nSpokesman: Clhia?\n\nCorrespondent: Clhia de Lavarne, Africa Confidential. I'm here, SecretaryGeneral.\n\nSpokesman: Over here. Over here.\n\nSecretary-General: Sorry.\n\nCorrespondent: I'm going to ask my question in French, if I was allowed.\n\nSecretary-General: Parfait.\n\nQuestion: Depuis le dbut de la guerre en Ukraine, il y a une fracture mais vraiment une fracture entre le monde occidental et le continent africain. Je suppose que vous lavez ressentie, que vous en tes conscient. Que fautil faire? Et comment peuton rassurer les Africains quand ils disent, on est juste, on est juste, comment dire, on soccupe de nous quand on doit voter, quand il y a un vote au Conseil de scurit, et en dehors de a, on est transparents. Que peuton faire pour runir ces deux mondes?\n\n[In English: Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, there has been a real fracture between the western world and the African continent. I'm sure that you have felt that, and you are aware of it. What must we do how can we reassure Africans when they say that they are we're only cared about when there is a vote in the Security Council, but beyond that, we don't seem to matter? What can we do to bring together those demands?]\n\nSecretary-General: La question essentielle qui gne les Africains, et qui gne dailleurs beaucoup dautres pays dans le monde en dveloppement, est la question de linjustice lie la croissance dramatique des ingalits laquelle nous assistons. Les pays africains nont pas bnfici dune distribution moralement correcte des vaccins. Les pays africains nont pas bnfici dune faon, enfin, dune faon nette de la distribution des droits de tirage spciaux, qui ont bnfici surtout [aux] pays les plus riches et la rallocation est trs lente. Les pays africains nont pas bnfici des mcanismes effectifs de rduction de la dette. Nous avons seulement trois pays en ngociations, la Zambie, le Tchad et lthiopie, et cette ngociation trane, trane, trane Les pays africains se voient aujourdhui dans une situation dramatique face laugmentation des prix des engrais, des aliments, de lnergie et, en plus, au problme des chanes de distribution the supply chains. Alors, il y a une norme frustration dans le monde en dveloppement face cette injustice frappante qui existe aujourdhui dans le monde. Et la seule faon de rtablir la confiance, cest en faisant des corrections majeures dans cette injustice, et dans les questions de la dette, et dans les questions de droits de tirages spciaux et dans les questions du climat, et notamment du financement li au climat, et dans toutes les autres questions qui puissent rtablir une certaine moralit dans les relations conomiques et financires internationales. Je crois quil faut que le monde dvelopp comprenne, il faut que les pays occidentaux comprennent que cette frustration dans le grand sud et en Afrique en particulier, est une frustration relle et quil nous faut une rponse effective qui sadresse la solution des problmes qui ont caus cette frustration.\n\n[In English: The main problem for Africa and many other developing countries is the issue of injustice due to the sharp rise in inequality that we are witnessing. African countries have not seen a morally fair vaccine distribution. African countries, also, have not clearly benefited from special drawing rights, which tend to benefit the richest countries first and foremost. And the reallocation of this is very slow. African countries have not benefited from effective debt reduction mechanisms. There are only three countries that are undergoing negotiations Zambia, Chad and Ethiopia. And these efficients are going on. They're dragging on. African countries are currently in a very difficult situation with regard to rising prices for fertilizer, food, energy in addition to problems with distribution of supply chains. So, there's a great deal of frustration in the developing world in reaction to this striking injustice throughout the world, and the only way to restore trust is to make serious changes to correct this injustice when it comes to special drawing rights, when it comes to climate, essentially climate financing, as well as all other issues that could be used to restore a sense of morality in international economic and financial relations. I believe that the developed world has to understand and western countries must understand that this frustration in the Global South, especially in Africa, is a real frustration, and we need to have an effective response to that that would provide solutions to the root causes of that frustration.]\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. Betul Yuruk with the Turkish news agency, Anadolu. My question will be on Syria. Turkish President recently proposed to set up a trilateral mechanism with Russia and Syria to accelerate diplomacy, and he said \"first, our intelligence agencies, then defence ministers, and then foreign ministers of the three countries could meet\". Have you been informed or consulted about such a mechanism? And would you support it? Thanks.\n\nSecretary-General: We have not been consulted, so it is premature to make any comment about that. I must say that our main concern, at the present moment, in relation to the situation in Syria, is in relation to the renewal of the possibility of crossborder humanitarian aid. Now that we have made progress, indeed and Trkiye has played a positive role on that in increasing the crossline support, but of course, it's not enough, and in addressing the problems of resilience investments related to resilience within the Syrian territory. So, that has been our major concern at the present moment. We have not been informed about this mechanism, and I cannot comment on something I do not know in detail.\n\nSpokesman: Mario, EFE?\n\nCorrespondent: SecretaryGeneral, Mario Villar with Spanish News Agency, EFE.\n\nSecretary-General: Hablar en espaol.\n\nSpokesman: Unfortunately, we do not have the Spanish interpretation.\n\nCorrespondent: Apparently, we don't have Spanish, so I'll do it in English.\n\nSecretary-General: But you can do it in Spanish and then do it in English. No problem.\n\nQuestion: Okay. Le puedo hacer una pregunta sobre la situacin en Per? Cul es su visin sobre la actual crisis y cree que alguna medida como las que se estn pidiendo en las protestas por ejemplo un adelanto de las elecciones puede ayudar aponer fin a la crisis?\n\nSecretary-General: Estamos en una situacin de parlisis poltico en el marco de una crisis econmica profunda y naturalmente esta es una enorme preocupacin para todos nosotros. Yo espero que los dirigentes libaneses comprendan que independientemente de las divisiones que existen entre ellos, todos ellos tienen un deber fundamental para con su pueblo y para con su pas y que la eleccin del Presidente de la Repblica tenga lugar muy rpidamente y que se creen condiciones para que el sistema poltico pueda funcionar.\n\nSpokesman: If you could\n\nSecretary-General: The question was related to Lebanon.\n\nSpokesman: Per.\n\nCorrespondent: Per.\n\nSecretary-General: Sorry?\n\nSpokesman: Per.\n\nSecretary-General: Oh, you said Per. I thought Beirut.\n\nSpokesman: No.\n\nSecretary-General: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I answered about Beirut.\n\nSpokesman: Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\nSecretary-General: I heard Beirut. Per. Per. Seguimos con mucha preocupacin la situacin en Per y creemos que es absolutamente necesario que haya un dilogo entre todas las fuerzas polticas y sociales del pas y naturalmente que la realizacin de elecciones anticipadas puede ser un factor importante para reestablecer la paz social en el pas. Y es muy importante naturalmente tambin que haya un mximo de contencin y de respeto de los derechos humanos en lo que respecta a las manifestaciones del pueblo.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you. Abdelhamid?\n\nQuestion: Hello, Mr. SecretaryGeneral. My name is Abdelhamid Siyam. I'm from the Arabic daily alQuds alArabi. The year 2022, sir, had witnessed a it was the bloodiest year for Palestinians in since 2006 in the West Bank. Journalists were targeted and killed, as you know, Shireen Abu Akleh. At least 55 children were killed. Two-hundred and nineteen also were killed, mostly civilians. And not only that, Israel elected the most extreme government in its history. And if you don't know who's [Itamar] BenGvir, you should read Kahanism and his ideology, which was banned by Israel itself. Now they are in power, and they coming to apparently, to wage a genocidal war against the Palestinians, yet your voice, sir, had not been loudly heard condemning all these atrocities committed against the Palestinian. What the Palestinian can do? Do they have the right to resist occupation the way the Ukrainians do have the same right? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, first of all, it's not true that I have not been clear and vocal about all these issues. In relation to the violence in which lots of Palestinians have perished, we were very clear in our condemnation. And if you read the last report that was presented by me to the Security Council, it is there again and loud and clear. And of course, we are concerned, because we believe that there is no Plan B to the twoState solution, and we are very concerned with what the next Israeli Government might do in that regard. And I think it's very important that the whole of the international community be very clear explaining to the Government in Israel that there is no alternative to the twostate solution and that no unilateral actions should be taken, putting into question the twostate solution.\n\nSpokesman: Carrie Nooten and then Kyodo.\n\nQuestion: Bonjour Monsieur le Secrtaire gnral. Merci pour cette confrence de presse. Jai des questions qui portent sur le continent africain. Alors, dj concernant le Mali, concernant les 46 soldats ivoiriens qui sont encore dtenus par Bamako. Vous mentendez bien?\n\nSecretary-General: Oui, oui.\n\nQuestion: En septembre dernier, sur nos antennes, vous aviez assur vouloir discuter avec la dlgation malienne et rsoudre ce problme. Estce que le statut de ces soldats par rapport lONU a t clarifi? Et o en eston de ces discussions? a cest ma premire question. Ma deuxime question, cest, cette anne on a vu deux porteparoles de lONU dclars persona non grata du Mali et de Rpublique dmocratique du Congo. Questce que cela signifie pour lavenir des missions de lONU dans ces pays?\n\n[In English: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral, SG. I have a question about the African continent with regard to Mali and the 46 Cte d'Ivoire soldiers still being detained by Bamako. Can you hear me? Last September, you had said that you wanted to discuss with the Malian delegation to resolve this issue. So, the status of these soldiers, with regard to the UN, has that been clarified? And where are we right now in the discussions? The first question. My second question is, this year, we saw two UN spokespeople declared persona non grata in Mali and the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo). So, what does this mean for the future of UN missions in that country, in those countries?]\n\nSecretary-General: Premirement, cest clair, et nous lavons exprim maintes fois, quil faut rgler rapidement le problme des Ivoiriens qui sont dtenus au Mali. Le fait quon pourrait avoir un certain moment quelques irrgularits bureaucratiques ne cre aucune raison pour quils soient en dtention. Il faut quils reviennent chez eux le plus rapidement possible. Et nous assistons une situation o nous avons des oprations de maintien de la paix o vritablement il ny a pas de paix maintenir. a cre invitablement une situation trs difficile pour les casques bleus. Cest trs facile de manipuler les populations en disant, voil, les casques bleus ne sont pas capables de dtruire les organisations terroristes ou dexpulser les mouvements comme le M23, au Congo. Cest pour a que nous continuons dire que la seule solution, la seule solution pour rsoudre cette contradiction entre oprations de maintien de la paix et inexistence de paix maintenir, cest lapprobation par le Conseil de scurit de mandats robustes et de contributions obligatoires, ou au moins de mcanismes de financement garanti pour des forces robustes africaines dimposition de la paix et de lutte antiterroriste. Il ne faut pas crer des illusions. La situation actuelle nest pas tenable terme. Il faut que la communaut internationale, et surtout que les grands billeurs de fonds comprennent que la scurit de lAfrique et la scurit de nous tous, dpend de la cration de mcanismes dimposition de la paix, avec des forces africaines robustes et avec un financement garanti, bas sur une dcision du Conseil de scurit, sous chapitre VII.\n\n[In English: First of all, it's very clear that we have said many times that we need to quickly resolve the problem of the Cte d'Ivoire soldiers detained in Mali. There may be certain bureaucratic irregularities, but that is not a sufficient reason for them to be detained. They must be returned home as soon as possible. We are seeing a situation where we have peacekeeping operations where there's not a peace to be kept, in fact. And this inevitably creates a very difficult situation for the blue helmets. It's very easy to manipulate public opinion by saying that the blue helmets are incapable of dealing with terrorist organizations or expelling movements like M23 (23 March Movement) in the DRC, and that is why we continue to say that the only possible solution, in order to resolve this contradiction between the peacekeeping operations and the lack of peace, is approval by the Security Council of robust mandates, as well as a mandatory contribution or at least guaranteed financial mechanisms for strong African forces to establish peace and to fight terrorism. We must not create illusions. The current situation cannot be maintained in the long term. The international community, especially major donors, must understand that security in Africa and for all of us depends on the creation of peaceestablishing mechanisms with strong African forces and with guaranteed financing based on a Security Council decision under Article VII.]\n\nQuestion: Donc, vous voulez une vraie rforme des missions de lONU?\n\n[In English: So, you would like to see a real reform of the UN mission. You'd like to see a real reform of UN peacekeeping missions?]\n\nSecretary-General: Pardon?\n\nQuestion: Vous voulez une vraie rforme des missions de lONU?\n\n[In English: Would you like to see a real reform of the UN Mission. You'd like to see a real reform of UN peacekeeping missions?]\n\nSpokesman: Vous voulez une vraie rforme des missions de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies?\n\nSecretary-General: Non. a veut dire que les missions de maintien de la paix ne sont pas adquates une solution o la paix nexiste pas et o il y a des forces terroristes comme celles que nous avons au Mali, o il y a des mouvements arms, comme le cas du M23, qui ont une capacit militaire qui est suprieure aux forces de maintien de la paix.\n\n[In English: No. This means that peacekeeping missions are not yet sufficient to deal with situations when there is no peace and where there are terrorist forces, such as in Mali, where there are armed movements, as in the case of M23, that have greater military capacity than that of peacekeeping forces.]\n\nSpokesman: Thank you.\n\nQuestion: Thank you, SecretaryGeneral. Toshi Inaba from Kyodo News, Japanese News Agency. I wish I had a Japanese interpreter. Anyway, let me ask you about the DPRK [Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea] missile and nuclear programme.\n\nSecretary-General: What nuclear programme?\n\nQuestion: DPRK.\n\nSpokesman: DPRK.\n\nQuestion: Missile nuclear programme. The Security Council is considering the Presidential statement. Do you think that will be enough to deter them from launching another barrage of missile ballistic missiles? And which would you agreed, like maximal pressure on them or posit of the dialogue, even if that involves easing of easing sanctions? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: We are clearly determined to pursue the total denuclearization the verifiable denuclearization and the reversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, an, namely, obviously, it means of the DPRK. And this is something that the international community must pursue constantly, utilizing all the legal instruments at the disposal of the international community, knowing that it will not be easy to reach this objective but that it is fundamental for peace and security in East Asia and in the world.\n\nQuestion: Is there any way is there any way that sorry. Is there any way the UN could intervene in the situation?\n\nSecretary-General: I mean, that is a question we must ask to the Security Council. The Secretariat can only do what we do. Any decision of the kind of the ones that you've mentioned depends on Security Council.\n\nSpokesman: Frank Ucciardo, TRT.\n\nCorrespondent: Mr. SecretaryGeneral, thank you for having this press conference\n\nSpokesman: A little louder, Frank, if you don't mind. Thank you.\n\nCorrespondent: Can you hear me now?\n\nSecretary-General: Yes.\n\nCorrespondent: It doesn't want to stay on.\n\nSpokesman: Don't touch the microphone.\n\nQuestion: There we go. Can you hear me now?\n\nSpokesman: Yep.\n\nSecretary-General: Yes.\n\nQuestion: Oh, great. Happy holiday to you and your family, a safe and really happy one. Thank you for having this press conference. Frank Ucciardo, TRT World. You were talking about Iran earlier and demonstrations. I wonder if you've given any thought to Iran and the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and what might be the future there. A lot of leading experts see there being a clear and present danger with what Iran is doing with its nuclear programme.\n\nSecretary-General: I have always believed that the JCPOA was a remarkable diplomatic achievement. I was very frustrated when the JCPOA was put into question, and we will do everything we can, in the context of our limited sphere of competence, to make sure that the JCPOA is not lost, recognizing that we are, at the present moment, in a serious risk of losing the JCPOA, which in my opinion, would be a very negative factor for peace and stability in the region and further afield.\n\nSpokesman: Lenka?\n\nQuestion: Thank you very much for this press conference. Lenka White from Sputnik. Followup on Twitter, please. You have over 2 million followers. What would have to happen?\n\nSecretary-General: Sorry, 2 million?\n\nQuestion: Two million followers on Twitter. What would have to happen that you would consider closing your account? And would you be interested in meeting with Elon Musk, as he has been meeting with many world leaders recently? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: Well, I will do whatever my conscience tells me to do in the moment in which it makes sense. So, for the moment, I think that the most reasonable thing is to maintain the account as it is, as the account has, also, an important role to play. But of course, we will be attentive to the situation. And I have to say that the question is not to be meeting people. The question is to have clear rules, clear rules that we need to establish in order for responsibilities of social media platforms to be clarified. We live in a kind of a legal void in which these platforms can do whatever they want, can convey whatever they want, and there are no legal consequences. In your you represent a\n\nSpokesman: Sputnik.\n\nSecretary-General: Sputnik. In your news agency, you are responsible for what you publish, and the same happens to any of the TV stations that are represented here or any of the newspapers that are represented here. Social media platforms are not legally responsible for what they publish, and in many circumstances it's not only the question of publishing something that is put there by someone else is that the algorithms are such that those algorithms amplify what is being put there. And there, I think, we need to create some forms of regulation that clarify responsibilities in that regard.\n\nSpokesman: Great. We're going to go online to Iftikhar Ali, Associated Press of Pakistan. Iftikhar?\n\nQuestion: Thank you, Steph. Can you hear me?\n\nSpokesman: Yes, sir.\n\nQuestion: Mr. SecretaryGeneral, thank you very much for this press conference. The Taliban have, obviously, failed to prevent TTP and other terrorist groups from attacking Pakistan from Afghan side despite their international pressure. In fact, the terrorist attacks against Pakistan have escalated as evidenced by Saturday's deadly attack at a police station in Lakki Marwat in Pakistan. Your reaction, please? And secondly, a short one on floods. You will be hosting an international conference on 9 January to mobilize for Pakistan's reconstruction programme. How will you help to mobilize such support, and what are your expectations?\n\nSpokesman: The TTP in Pakistan.\n\nSecretary-General: And the second?\n\nSpokesman: Your expectation\n\nSecretary-General: Well, there are several clear things that we believe the Taliban must deliver from the point of view of the interests of the international community and from the point of view of the interests of Afghanistan itself. One thing that they must deliver in relation to the inclusion in the power structures in Afghanistan. We have different ethnic groups, and it's important that all ethnic groups are represented. A second aspect in relation to human rights, in particular women and girls' rights, the right of women to work, the right of girls to attend school at all levels without discrimination. And there is another clear ask from the international community, which is for Afghanistan to stop all forms of activity of terrorist organizations that from Afghanistan represent a threat to neighbouring countries, including Pakistan. And so, we are actively engaged in our discussions with the Taliban de facto authorities in relation to this, and we consider that it is absolutely essential for the Taliban not to allow any form of terrorist activity that might have an impact in relation to Pakistan, as in relation to any other country of the region. On the other hand, I am totally committed to do everything possible to mobilize the international community to support Pakistan. I've been in Pakistan immediately after the floods [that] have occurred. I was dramatically impressed by what I've seen, three times the area of my own country flooded, terrible loss of crops and of animals and of houses and of life, for the population of Sindh and Balochistan and absolutely devastating situation. And I believe the international community has a strong responsibility to support Pakistan that has contributed in a very minimal way to climate change. There is a huge responsibility of the international community to support Pakistan in relation to the conference that we'll have 9 January in Paris\n\nSpokesman: In Geneva.\n\nSecretary-General: in Geneva, sorry, to fully mobilize the resources that are needed. I was also in recent contact with the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the World Bank. There, hopefully, will be also, from these two institutions, meaningful action. And the Pakistani people deserves and needs a strong expression of international solidarity.\n\nSpokesman: We're going to squeeze in two short questions, Paolo and then Joe, but very short, please.\n\nQuestion: Paolo Mastrolilli with the Italian daily La Repubblica. Thank you very much for the press conference, and happy holidays to you, as well. There is a new government in Italy, and as you know, there have already been tension with France concerning the migrants coming from Africa. What should the new Italian Government do and the European Union do about this issue?\n\nSecretary-General: Well, since I was High Commissioner for Refugees 16 years ago, I\n\nSpokesman: No, no.\n\nSecretary-General: Seventeen years ago I started\n\nSpokesman: Yeah, you started.\n\nSecretary-General: since I started those functions, and even when I was Prime Minister in Portugal, I was very clear in relation to affirming the same policy. I'm proud that we did it in Portugal to massive legalization of all migrants existing in my country, and we always thought that migration was part of the solution of the problems of my country at the time, and I believe it's part of the solution of European problems. And I always believed that we need to have a European mechanism to address the challenge of migration to make sure that migration's potential for European development is I mean, is that we take profit of it, and at the same time, that the dramatic human rights situation that migrants suffer in the hands of smugglers and traffickers ends, and this is not possible without an effective European cooperation at that level.\n\nSpokesman: Joe, one quick question, and then we go.\n\nQuestion: Joseph Klein, Canada Free Press. I'll try to make this as quick as possible. On the issue of social media platforms, I want to go back to that. You mentioned the need for regulation. I'm wondering if you have any views on where that regulation should come from, the national level? Should there be some international body analogous to the Internet Governance body? And who gets to define what is misinformation since notions that were originally thought to be wrong and antiscience, in some cases, turned out to be correct, for example the issue of transmissibility even if you have a vaccination. There have been other things that have changed over time. So, who gets to decide what is misinformation? Thank you.\n\nSecretary-General: I think that there are several levels. There are things that require international legislation. I think the European Union has demonstrated that, in many aspects, that is possible. And I believe that there were a number of important developments in this regard. It would be good if they could become more global. Other areas require dialogue between Governments, scientists, companies, civil society in order to establish forms of soft regulation based on different kinds of commitments. This is the objective of the Global Compact we are proposing for the Summit of the Future. In others, there are questions that are related to the sense of responsibility of the operators themselves that have a responsibility that needs to be put in question. Now, there is only one way to fight misinformation is to issue the right information and to actively engage in that. That's what we have done with the Verified initiative. That's what many are doing, putting several symbols of the same nature whether there are sciencebased demonstrations. Now, one thing is science progresses. So, one day, science will be able to improve its knowledge about reality, but that doesn't mean that the previous level of scientific knowledge is misinformation. It's just progress. Other thing is to deliberately put on social media things that people know are wrong, and that's what we have witnessed in many aspects during the COVID time. I mean, there are many there might be many questions about vaccines, but one thing is absolutely clear. Thanks to vaccines, the number of people that died diminished dramatically. And this nobody questions in the world except those that want to deliberately lie in that respect.\n\nSpokesman: Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nCorrespondent: Thank you.",

                "cc_text": "2:13 p.m. EST\n\nMR PRICE: All right. Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nQUESTION: Hello.\n\nMR PRICE: Hello. A couple things at the top, and then well turn to your questions.\n\nThe United States condemns, in the strongest terms, the Talibans indefensible decision to ban women from universities, to keep secondary schools closed to girls, and to continue to impose other restrictions on the ability of women and girls in Afghanistan to exercise their human rights and their fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Talibans decision to close secondary schools to girls last March has had a significant impact on our engagement with the Taliban representatives. The Taliban made promises to the people of Afghanistan and to the international community that schools would reopen. They claimed that this was a matter of procedures and arrangements and would be quickly reversed.\n\nNow, we hear the opposite: An order from the so-called Higher Education Ministry yesterday states that women cannot attend universities either. With the implementation of this decree, half of the Afghan population will soon be unable to access education beyond primary school.\n\nAfghanistan is already losing more than $1 billion per year in contributions that women could be making to the economy. Now the Taliban have imposed these losses on the Afghan people for the indefinite future. Furthermore, the Taliban have permanently sentenced Afghan women to a darker and more barren future without opportunity. No country can thrive when half of its population is arbitrarily held back.\n\nEducation is an internationally recognized human right and it is essential to Afghanistans economic growth and its stability. This unacceptable stance will have significant consequences for the Taliban and will further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy they desire.\n\nNext and finally, today, the United States Department of the Treasury announced one of the most important updates to our sanctions policy in years. In September, Secretary Blinken announced the United States intent to ensure that food, medicine, and humanitarian assistance are exempted from UN and U.S. sanctions programs. The first step in achieving that goal was the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2664 on December 9, which exempts humanitarian assistance from UN Security Council-imposed asset freeze measures. We are grateful to Ireland for codrafting this resolution with us.\n\nToday, the Treasury Department is releasing a package of general licenses for humanitarian authorizations across U.S. sanctions programs that will establish consistent regulations, streamline compliance for humanitarian and commercial actors, and ultimately help ensure sanctions do not unduly impact humanitarian conditions around the world. The general licenses implement UN Security Council Resolution 2664 and build upon the humanitarian authorizations this administration has already incorporated across several U.S. domestic sanctions programs. We believe that these reforms will make our sanctions clearer, stronger, and more effective.\n\nWe look forward to working with our allies and partners around the world and with humanitarian actors and financial institutions to ensure these licenses are properly understood, so that food, medicine, and other aid reach those most in need. The licenses announced today are one critical step to meeting the humanitarian challenges of unprecedented magnitude while maintaining the integrity of our sanctions to promote international peace, security, and stability as well.\n\nWith that, Shaun.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks. Could I follow up on Afghanistan?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: You mentioned that the earlier ban by the Taliban on girls at secondary schools had a significant impact on U.S. engagement. I mean, from that one could say that whats the impact in terms of what the U.S. is doing? I mean, do you find any way to persuade the Taliban? Is it is there any means at the U.S.s disposal to actually effect change?\n\nMR PRICE: So a couple things on this. You just heard a message of condemnation from us, from the United States. I have every expectation that you, and more importantly in this case, the Taliban will be hearing similar messages of condemnation of the step that they announced today. Our allies and partners will be joining us in a chorus calling out this decision, lamenting it, and making clear where the international community stands on this indefensible decision. That, of course, is important that the Taliban hear this united messaging, but just as important is the fact that we will be imposing accountability measures on the Taliban. And I suspect, just as we have coordinated with this messaging, many of our partners will be doing the same in the days to come.\n\nThe Taliban should expect that this decision, which is in contravention to the commitments they have made repeatedly and publicly to their own people, will carry costs will carry concrete costs for them. So of course thats what were doing to hold the Taliban to account. There are a number of tools that we can draw from to do this. Not going to be able to go into any more specifics today.\n\nBut then theres also the affirmative side of the ledger what it is that were doing in the absence of the Taliban upholding the commitments theyve made to the Afghan people to support the Afghan people, and suffice to say, the United States is doing a lot. We continue to lead the worlds humanitarian response to the needs of the Afghan people. Since August of 2021, the United States has committed some $1.1 billion in humanitarian assistance, some much of this money is funding that can go to support the lives, the livelihoods, of women and girls those who will be most impacted, who have been most impacted by these draconian and barbaric decrees that weve heard from the Taliban since March and more recently affirmed today. So just as we hold the Taliban to account, we are prepared and we will continue to support the Afghan people in every way we can.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just follow up on that? Just wondering I mean the you say that itll carry costs for them. I know youre probably not announcing anything right now this was just in the past hour or two but what type of costs? Are you talking about costs in terms of the lack of further engagement, the lack of that this was, in fact this was a diplomatic engagement with the Taliban. Could there be any economic costs?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we have had our suspicions for some time that a move like this was potentially coming. And as soon as we became aware that the Taliban, despite their assurances after the March decree that they would do otherwise, at least the assurances from some Taliban officials, we redoubled our efforts, again with our allies and partners around the world, to make clear to the Taliban that such a move would represent a tremendous setback to their own objectives, to their own goals, and would carry with it concrete implications again, not just from the United States, but from the international community.\n\nWe reminded the Taliban that their actions, their behavior towards their own people will define our relationship with them. They know full well that the United States and our partners cant have a normal relationship with the Taliban when it makes moves like this, when it fails to uphold its commitments to the international community, but very much to its own people. And the Taliban have made a commitment to respect the human rights of all Afghans. Needless to say, this flies directly in the face of that.\n\nThis decision and the Taliban understand that this decision will be a tremendous setback to the improvement of relations that they seek with countries around the world. They know that any improvement is contingent upon their own actions. They know that this step with this step that they have taken, they have seriously, possibly even fatally, undermined one of their deepest ambitions in other areas where they seek progress, and that is an improvement, a betterment of relations with the United States and the rest of the world.\n\nSo on top of that, I do fully expect that we will continue to pull from the tools that we have at our disposal to hold the Taliban to account. Some senior members of the Taliban are already subject to certain measures. The Taliban as an organization is subject to certain measures. And we will look to see what more we can do to hold the Taliban to account for todays announcement, even as, importantly, we continue to support the people of Afghanistan with our humanitarian assistance that very deliberately bypasses the Taliban and goes directly to the needs of the Afghan people.\n\nMichele.\n\nQUESTION: Are there any implications for the frozen funds and that the international fund that you guys set up that I think is being run by the World Bank? And second of all, what makes you think after all this time that they want better relations with the West?\n\nMR PRICE: So first of all, on the frozen funds and we spoke a couple of months ago regarding the course, the approach we took for these funds, which very intentionally did not constitute a recapitalization of the Afghan Central Bank. And we didnt recapitalize the Afghan Central Bank because we didnt have confidence that doing so would keep these funds out of Taliban hands or that it would not leave them at grave great risk for the potential of diversion. The way the Afghan fund has been set up puts in place a system of checks and balances to ensure that literally the balance of this fund will be used for primarily the macroeconomic needs of the Afghan people. These are not funds to which the Taliban has access. These are funds that are at the discretion of those who oversee the board of this Afghan fund, including prominent Afghan stakeholders themselves. So this will continue to be an important resource for primarily for the macroeconomic stabilization of Afghanistan, for the viability of its currency, for the economic stability that the people of Afghanistan need.\n\nOn the second part of your question, we have engaged with the Taliban consistently since even before August of 2021. We have had a number of conversations with them predicated on the issues that matter most to us. They, in turn, have had several opportunities now to engage with us directly on the issues that are of most importance to them. Just as I wouldnt for any other interlocuter, Im not going to precisely characterize what weve heard from them, but theyve made it clear to us in private including in private that they seek an improvement in relations with the United States. Not only do they seek that in practice, in principle, but they, of course, seek the concrete, the very real implications that would come with that.\n\nAfghanistan, over the course of the past 20 years, was a country that was heavily reliant on international assistance. Its budget was primarily funded by the international donor community. It is a country that is heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance. The prior Afghan government relied on various forms of assistance from the international community. The same will be true of the next government of Afghanistan. It will need assistance; it will need support; it will need resources from the international community. The resources that we provided the last Afghan government certainly is not on the table for the Taliban, not on the table for them if they emerge as the official government of Afghanistan.\n\nThe level of our support and the nature of our relationship is wholly contingent on the actions that they take towards their own people and the actions that they take with regard to our primary interests. And weve talked about those interests human rights, safe passage for those who wish to depart Afghanistan, the counterterrorism commitments that theyve made to the United States and to the international community, the ability of the people of Afghanistan to have a government that is representative and inclusive of all of the people of Afghanistan, including its girls, its women, its minorities. Thats whats important to us. That is what will define the future of our relationship with the Taliban.\n\nAnything else on\n\nQUESTION: Can I have a follow up on this?\n\nQUESTION: On Afghanistan?\n\nQUESTION: Ill get Kylie, and Said.\n\nQUESTION: Just is there anything you can say about the two Americans who were released from Taliban detention and are on their way to Doha or maybe have landed there, and what the U.S. gave the Taliban in order to secure their release?\n\nAnd just if you could speak to if you think its strategic on the Talibans part to allow this release to happen at the same time as a suspension of womens education for universities. Do you think that they are sort of trying to gain goodwill from the U.S. while they do something that you ardently oppose?\n\nMR PRICE: So on that final question, that is a good question for the Taliban. Its not exactly a good question for us. We can only speculate and its not something wed want to do from here.\n\nYou are right to point out that this indefensible decree did come on the same day that we are in a position to welcome the release of two Americans, two U.S. nationals, from detention in Afghanistan. We are providing these two U.S. nationals with all appropriate assistance. They will soon be reunited with their loved ones, and we are absolutely gratified to see that.\n\nTo the first part of your question, this we understand to have been a goodwill gesture on the part of the Taliban. This was not part of any swap of prisoners or detainees. There was no money that exchanged hands. We understand this, or at least the Taliban characterized this to us, as a goodwill gesture.\n\nAnd the irony of them granting us a goodwill gesture on a day where they undertake a gesture like this to the Afghan people, its not lost on us. But it is a question for the Taliban themselves regarding the timing of this.\n\nI think the point remains that we will always be consistent in advocating for our interests with the Taliban if there is to continue to be engagement with the Taliban, and our interests are consistent with the interests of the people of Afghanistan. We have an interest in seeing Americans released from detention. We obviously welcome the release of these two Americans today. That is a uniquely U.S. interest.\n\nBut beyond that, the categories that I spoke to earlier human rights, safe passage, representative government, counterterrorism, go down the list all of these are priority issues for the Afghan people. In our engagement with the Taliban we will continue to be take a principled and pragmatic approach. We will continue to advocate for these interests. We will continue to advocate for everything weve been seeking since this period of our engagement began.\n\nQUESTION: And just one more question. Are there any other Americans who are detained in Afghanistan at this time?\n\nMR PRICE: So we continue to raise with the Taliban the need for the immediate release of any U.S. nationals detained in Afghanistan, but Im just not in a position to offer specifics.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, very quickly. You said that you engaged with the Taliban prior to 2021, or prior to the departure. You also engaged with the Taliban before September 11. I remember when a minister came into Washington and went on a goodwill tour throughout the United States. And my question to you is after 20 years of war and upward of a trillion dollars spent and so on, what has changed? Should the United States perhaps bear some responsibility for the situation that you started out with today?\n\nMR PRICE: Said, we had an opportunity to speak to this at some length around the time of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and I think in the 20 years that have transpired since October of 2001 when U.S. military forces first went into Afghanistan there has been some perhaps degradation in the understanding of that original mission. And I think your question speaks to that.\n\nThe United States didnt go into Afghanistan in October of 2021 2001, excuse me, on a nation-building mission. We never went into Afghanistan to remake a society, to fabricate a society that was based on the principles we hold most dear. We went into Afghanistan in October of 2001 for a simple mission: to go after the network that attacked the United States on September 11th of that year.\n\nWe were successful in that mission. Arguably not arguably, in fact we were successful in that mission years ago. It was in the years after, the few years after 9/11, that this small network that was behind 9/11 was on the run certainly, degraded certainly. It was in 2011, more than a decade before August of 2021 that Osama bin Laden was removed from the battlefield. Since then, his lieutenants have been taken off the battlefield most recently Ayman al-Zawahiri, who of course we pursued successfully earlier this year.\n\nSo it is the case that we went into Afghanistan with a defined mission. Many people lost sight of that mission over time, but we were successful in concluding that mission. And that is a its a primary reason why, as he was considering this decision early on in the administration, President Biden felt that it was no longer responsible to keep a contingent of American service members in Afghanistan engaged in a state of hostility or at the very least under threat from terrorist actors and other forces, that it was past time to complete the military withdrawal, a withdrawal that multiple presidents before him actually called for and sought to do, but for one reason or another ended up choosing not to do so.\n\nAnything else on this? Alex. Still on this?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so much.\n\nQUESTION: Still on Afghanistan?\n\nQUESTION: No.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just ask I know theres probably a limit to what you can say, but can you just tell us a little bit more about the two Americans, how long they were detained? Are they Afghan Americans? Is there anything more you can detail about their situation?\n\nMR PRICE: Unfortunately, theres not in this case. And as you know, our ability to speak to the details of any particular case is dictated by the wishes of any particular American. In this case, there is just not more I can say, unfortunately.\n\nSaid. Or sorry, were we Alex, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, thank you. Going back to your opening statement on improving humanitarian aid delivery across U.S. sanctions, are there particular sanctions that we are talking about?\n\nMR PRICE: This is and it was a step that we announced to ensure that there is full understanding across all of our sanctions programs regarding what is and what is not permitted. The sanctions environment is itself quite complex. There are a number of sanctions regimes, country-specific regimes and otherwise. We also know that there is a difference or at least there can be a difference between whats on the books in terms of our sanctions and the perception of whats on the books when it comes to our sanctions. And across our sanctions programs, what were trying to prevent is what is oftentimes called overcompliance, or de-risking, by oftentimes private sector actors who want not to run afoul of U.S. sanctions.\n\nSo this was a very it was a sweeping step that builds upon the UN Security Council resolution that was recently adopted to send a very clear signal that the United States does not want, does not seek, to take any steps that would impede the ability of those in need around the world to benefit from humanitarian assistance. This is true of our country-specific sanctions programs, and some of these programs already have humanitarian authorizations in place. That includes those programs in Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, in Venezuela. But this was a rather sweeping step to make sure that all parties who might be otherwise deterred by U.S. sanctions programs are not deterred and in fact are ambitious in providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need.\n\nQUESTION: Im asking because Im just curious how much this clears away in terms of designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Because one of the reasons the only reason, actually, we were given why you were so reluctant to do so is that because you didnt want to block the way in terms of reaching out with humanitarian aid. So are we one step closer to designating Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: I wouldnt connect these two elements. I think certainly this step today does not take any actions off the table. We have spoken about our thinking when it comes to the state sponsor of terrorism designation as it relates to Russia and the challenges that are posed there, the challenges you raise when it comes to humanitarian organizations. Thats certainly one of them, and weve heard from humanitarian organizations that such a designation would hamper their ability to provide humanitarian assistance, including inside Ukraine. Obviously, we are attuned to that. But were also as were required to do, we are very attuned to the law and what the law stipulates, the criteria it sets forth to designate a country as a state sponsor of terrorism. Its our task to marry whats in the books, whats in the law, with the facts on the ground.\n\nBut as weve spoken about, as weve as youve heard us say before, were working with Congress on a potential alternative that would allow us to continue to increase the costs on the Kremlin and those who are responsible for Russias war against Ukraine without some of the unintended consequences that the state sponsor of terrorism, the state sponsor designation might bring.\n\nQUESTION: And can I also ask you about Russia-Iran, please? British defense minister today said that Russia will give Iran advanced military components in return to in return for new drones. So theyre talking about 300. The White House had a chance to address this this morning, but this is two-ways road so Iran will receive as well in this case advanced military components. Im asking about that part of the coin. Why does Iran needs Russian advanced military components? To use against Iranian people? To use against neighbors? Should we be worried about Irans behavior backed by Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is a point that we, too, have made. And I think it was on December 9th that I think we might have used that exact term: its a two-way street. Its a partnership between Iran and Russia. Weve spoken since July of Russias provision excuse me, of Irans provision of armed UAVs to Russia for lethal use inside of Ukraine. But more recently, we spoke about the two-way nature of this relationship and the fact that in exchange for these armed UAVs, Russia is offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support. Its transforming their relationship into a full-fledged defense partnership. Weve spoken about the challenges that this partnership presents not only to Ukraine, but to Irans neighbors in the region as well.\n\nIts not for us to speak to Irans intentions, what Iran might seek to do with the military and technical support that Russia is providing it. But youve heard from us consistently the track record of Iran that certainly gives us pause when Iran comes into possession of potentially greater know-how, more sophisticated technology, technical support expertise as well. Iran has a track record not only of using its instruments of the state to conduct violent, destabilizing actions through the region, but providing support to terrorist groups, to proxies, to others who themselves have a destabilizing and profoundly unhelpful influence across the region.\n\nSaid.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Switching topic?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. There was an article in Politico today on Bidens strategy for a far-right Israel: lay it all on Bibi. And it says that the Biden administration will hold the presumptive Israeli prime minister personally responsible for the action of his more extreme cabinet members. Is that the policy in your view? Will that be the policy towards Israel in the coming months and so on, or toward the presumptive Israeli right-wing government?\n\nMR PRICE: So a couple things. One, this is all still a hypothetical. There is not a government in place, and so were going to refrain from commenting on the exact dynamics of any coalition that is yet to be formed. But we know that we will have a constructive relationship with the next Israeli government. Well have an opportunity to advance not only our shared interests, but also the values that have long been at the heart of the strategic partnership we have with Israel. This doesnt pertain just to Israel or to any one country, but of course the head of government or the head of state is by definition the head of government, the head of state, and we have a relationship with that individual as such.\n\nYes, Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. On North Korea, North Korea continues illegal transshipment of oil items. Why cant the United States stop this?\n\nMR PRICE: The illegal transshipment of oil?\n\nQUESTION: Yeah.\n\nMR PRICE: So Janne, this gets back to a related point that we were speaking to earlier. First, we do have a robust sanctions program on the DPRK. Its a sanctions program that owes to years now decades, I should say of North Korea, of the DPRKs brazenly illegal flouting of international law and the multiple UN Security Council resolutions that have been put in place regarding its ballistic missile program and its nuclear weapons program. The sanctions program, as I said before, is comprehensive. Here too we do have humanitarian carveouts for the people of the DPRK, but it is comprehensive owing to the scale and the scope of the challenge that the DPRK presents to the region and potentially beyond.\n\nThe UN Security Council resolutions that govern this the international aspect of this sanctions regime were put in place by the Security Council, of course, which means that all five Permanent Members of the Security Council voted in favor of each one of these UN Security Council resolutions. In many cases that was now years ago. And what we are seeing and I think what weve seen accelerate in recent years are two members of the Security Council choose not to uphold the commitments that they themselves had made, have chosen not to uphold the Security Council resolutions that they themselves helped craft and to put in place in the first instance. That has, unfortunately, given the DPRK additional breathing room.\n\nWe think it is incumbent upon all members of the UN Security Council, but especially the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, to uphold the very commitments that they have made. When the P5 the so-called P5 choose not to do so for whatever reason, it erodes the capability, it erodes the legitimacy of the Security Council itself.\n\nNow, of course, our concerns and profound disagreements with members of the Security Council go well beyond the DPRK, and weve spoken to them in the context of Russias brutal war against Ukraine. But the DPRK is an excellent example of a challenge to the region and beyond where we can and should be working with the other Permanent Five members of the Security Council, in this case China and Russia.\n\nThere has years past have seen a good deal of cooperation between the United States and these two members of the Security Council in an effort to contain the DPRKs ballistic missile and nuclear weapon program nuclear weapons program. But these two members have chosen not to uphold their own commitments and, unfortunately, have chosen to look the other way when the DPRK has consistently defied international law and these Security Council resolutions.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I have another one. IAEA secretary general Grossi recently visited South Korea, and he said that North Korea is trying to possess weapons-grade nuclear weapons and they are ready to dispatch an inspectorate. What is the U.S. position on this?\n\nMR PRICE: That he said that the IAEA was prepared to dispatch inspectors?\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\nMR PRICE: Of course, we have full faith and confidence in the IAEA. It performs an indispensable mission. But it is not any fault of the IAEA it is the fault of the DPRK that they have chosen to flout international law, they have chosen to develop this nuclear weapons program in contravention of international law, of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and in a way that gravely undermines the global nuclear nonproliferation regime. Its of concern to us; its of concern to the international community. Its of concern to the IAEA as well.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, Ned. I asked you yesterday about the a meeting of the top advisors of the prime minister of Greece and the president of Turkey. The you asked me to ask the Germans, and they said that they set a meeting. But can do you have any comment as State Department spokesman about this?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure. Weve made the point before that this is a time when we need unity between and cohesion between our allies, certainly between and among our NATO Allies. We always regret the escalation of provocative statements. The tensions within an alliance, between two alliance members, certainly does not help anyone. To that end, we welcome the recent meeting in Brussels between Anna-Maria Boura, Prime Minister Mitsotakiss diplomatic advisor, and Ibrahim Kalin, President Erdoans spokesperson and chief advisor, and we continue to encourage these discussions at all levels.\n\nQUESTION: I have another question, please. I dont know if you heard yesterday the Senator Menendez, he attacked the president of Turkey for his statement that he will fire a missile at Athens unless Greeks stay calm. He also said that the recent actions by Turkeys president, which include this threat to fire a missile at Athens, are not only disturbing they are totally unacceptable. He said also that Erdoan is a close friend and ally of the presidents of Russia and Iran, and he said as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he will not approve any F-16s for Turkey until Erdoan halts his campaign of aggression across the entire region. And I wanted to know what do you think and if you agree with the senator.\n\nMR PRICE: Our assessment is what is reflected in what I just shared regarding the statements that weve heard between our two close NATO Allies. This is a time, we think, when unity within the Alliance and between and among Allies is especially important. We regret the escalation of tensions between two Allies, especially between two such important NATO Allies. It doesnt serve anyones interests, and we continue to support all efforts to de-escalate those tensions, including the efforts that are being undertaken now or have been undertaken in Brussels.\n\nLet me go yes, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Moving to Japan, you may have seen the report that President Joe Biden will possibly visit to Nagasaki during his trip to Japan next May for Hiroshima summit, G7 summit. Do you have anything to share about ongoing discussion between United States and Japan regarding this?\n\nMR PRICE: Im just not in a position to share any details. I have seen that report; Im not in a position to confirm it. I would note that the White House just today confirmed presidential travel for next month. I dont think were quite at the point of confirming travel for May just yet, but I am sure the White House will have more details when details are start to firm up.\n\nYes, in the back.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. My question is about North Korea. So recently, sister of Kim Jong-un implied that North Korea is ready to test-run ICBM at a normal trajectory. So how does the State Department assess the possibility of DPRK launching ICBM at a normal trajectory? And also, do you think DPRKs ICBM launch could cross the red line of the U.S.?\n\nMR PRICE: We continue to believe that the DPRK is poised to undertake additional provocations. The DPRK has taken a wide variety of steps, including ICBM launches. We continue to believe the possibility of a seventh nuclear test is on the table. Weve said for a number of months now all technical preparations appear to be in place. It is really only a political decision at this point as to whether the DPRK goes ahead with a nuclear test. Whether it is an ICBM test, as you described, or a nuclear test, this would be significant, severe, grave escalation that the United States would take especially seriously.\n\nIn response to the DPRKs prior ICBM launches, weve worked with the international community to impose additional accountability measures on those who are responsible for the DPRKs ballistic missile program. The same would, of course, be true if the DPRK were to undertake a seventh nuclear test. We would seek to impose additional measures on those responsible for its nuclear program, even as we would seek to ensure that we have sufficient defense and deterrent capabilities in the region by working closely with our treaty allies, Japan and the ROK in this case, to whom we have an ironclad commitment, an ironclad security commitment.\n\nBut our message continues to be that these provocations are dangerous; theyre destabilizing; they are unnecessary, especially when the United States has made clear time and again that we harbor no hostile intent towards the DPRK. Were prepared to engage in principled diplomacy to achieve or to advance our ultimate goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We urge the DPRK to take us up on that offer, to change course, to cease with the provocations, and to engage in diplomacy to address this challenge.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: One more on the region, Ned.\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: The Japanese foreign minister is scheduled to visit China next week. Will the Secretary be having any phone calls with his counterpart before or after his trip? And does the Secretary plan on visiting Japan and South Korea while hes in the region next year?\n\nMR PRICE: I am certain that well have a chance to get to the region before too long. We dont have any we, ourselves, dont have any travel to the region to announce just yet, just as the White House does not, nor do we have any calls between the Secretary and his counterpart Foreign Minister Hayashi currently lined up. But as you know, they speak often. They see each other quite frequently. And we do have a practice of keeping one another updated on our shared approach to the PRC. The Japanese affirmed that shared approach to the regional security challenges in the documents theyve they released just a few days ago. In the aftermath of our engagements with senior PRC officials, including President Xi, including Wang Yi, Yang Jiechi, we have developed a habit of providing our treaty allies with context from those sessions in coordinating closely on our approach. And I assume that will continue going forward as well.\n\nYes, Elizabeth.\n\nQUESTION: Were a few weeks out, but how concerned is the U.S. that Russia will veto the cross-border aid mechanism for Syria when it comes up for renewal at the Security Council next month? And is this something that the U.S. is discussing with the Russians?\n\nMR PRICE: So this is a reference to UN Security Council Resolution 2642 that was passed in July of this year that authorized continuing cross-border aid into Syria for six months. I believe the Security Council will take up the renewal of this mandate on January 10th. It is the hope, it is the expectation of the United States and of the United States that all council members and, of course most notably, Russia will recognize and respond to what is undeniably the urgent need to extend cross-border humanitarian efforts. Millions of Syrians remain reliant on this lifesaving humanitarian mechanism, and the council we believe must act to ensure Syrians continue to have access to basic needs, particularly in the depth of winter, as this vote will come in January.\n\nWe made this clear at the time, but we remain disappointed that the resolution that was passed almost six months ago now in July was only for six months. We believe and we believed at the time that a straightforward 12-month renewal of the cross-border aid mechanism was essential and this six-month resolution, having to go through these motions every six months, only makes it harder and costlier for humanitarian actors to plan their operations and to procure the necessary supplies. Its not only the United States that has been making the case; the Secretary-General has been clear as well that this is a moral imperative that we renew this mandate. And we believe as we do when it comes to all matters of humanitarian concern that something like this should not be politicized. This is about people and lives and livelihoods and not about politics.\n\nShaun.\n\nQUESTION: Back to Asia. COVID in China. You mentioned yesterday that there was there are concerns for the global economy, in terms of whats happening in China. There are reports from many of our news outlets, but crematoriums having huge caseloads of dead people. Is there anything you can further about how the U.S. assesses the COVID situation in China? Is there anything potentially that the United States could or is willing to do on that regard?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure. I made the point yesterday, Shaun, that the United States joins the rest of the world in hoping to see the PRC defeat this outbreak and to get COVID under control. That, of course, is the case because we dont want to see death or disease spread anywhere. We also know that whenever the virus is spreading anywhere widely in an uncontrolled fashion, the potential it has the potential for variants to emerge. Weve already seen firsthand the cost of variants that have mutated and that have spread around the world. But third, we also note that what happens in China does have implications for the global economy. And its important not only for the PRC but also for the continued economic recovery of the international community that the PRC is in a position to get this outbreak under control.\n\nWe believe in doing so its important that all countries and this includes the PRC its important that all countries focus on getting people vaccinated and making testing and treatment easily available. Weve said this many times publicly, but the U.S. is the largest donor of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. We are prepared to continue to support people around the world, including in China, with this and other COVID-related health support. This is in the interests of the international community that we all collectively do everything we can to help China get this under control.\n\nQUESTION: Can I just the last point, youre saying that the U.S. of course is the largest donor on COVID supplies. Is this basically an offer of vaccines to China? Has it actually been formally discussed with the PRC?\n\nMR PRICE: Look, Im not going to go into private discussions, but weve made the point many times publicly that we are the largest donor of COVID-19 vaccines around the world. Were prepared to continue to support countries around the world, including China, on this and other COVID-related health support. This is profoundly in the interests of the rest of the world. Our COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and weve provided them to countries around the world regardless or in spite of any political disagreements. For us, this is not about politics; its not about geopolitics. It is about saving lives, saving livelihoods.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask Iran deal related question\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: really quickly? A White House official told our colleague from Al Arabiya at the White House that currently the deal really does not garner any importance or not important at all. So I want to ask you on the importance scale of 1 to 10, where do you put the importance going back to the deal at this point, or are you going to pull the plug on the deal on the process?\n\nMR PRICE: Look, Said, weve made the point for several months now that the JCPOA is not on the agenda. It hasnt been on the agenda for some time. Of course, there have been instances where we thought we are on the precipice of a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, only to find the Iranians turning their backs on a deal that was on the table, a deal that had otherwise been approved by all. So it hasnt been on the agenda for us for months. It hasnt been our focus. Since September, certainly our focus has been on standing up for the fundamental freedoms of the Iranian people and countering Irans deepening military partnership with Russia and its support for Russia as Moscow wages its brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: So you declare it dead?\n\nMR PRICE: Im sorry.\n\nQUESTION: So you declared the deal agreement dead already?\n\nMR PRICE: It is certainly the case that the Iranian\n\nQUESTION: In a coma or what?\n\nMR PRICE: It is certainly the case that the Iranians killed the opportunity for a swift return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. They killed that opportunity for a swift return to compliance most recently in September when, again, we were on the precipice we thought of a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. All of the other parties had agreed, but instead of putting us in a position to go forward, the Iranians reneged.\n\nWhat is very much alive is the Presidents commitment and this administrations commitment that Iran is never in possession of a nuclear weapon. We continue to believe that diplomacy represents the most effective and sustainable way to achieve that goal and to see to it that Iran is verifiably and permanently barred from obtaining a nuclear weapon. At the same time though, we have an extensive toolkit. We have not removed any option from the table as well.\n\nQUESTION: So if they return, you will return?\n\nMR PRICE: Im sorry.\n\nQUESTION: If the Iranian would return\n\nMR PRICE: This is its just a its a complete hypothetical at this point. Its not even academic because the Iranians have demonstrated time and again that they are not prepared for a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, and they have, most recently in September, killed the opportunity for a swift return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA.\n\nAbbie.\n\nQUESTION: Just to clarify\n\nQUESTION: Given that\n\nMR PRICE: Let me move around. Abbie.\n\nQUESTION: Given that Iranian officials have come out more vocally seeming to move towards wanting to go back to earlier discussions about a return to the deal, is the U.S. willing to reengage in those discussions?\n\nMR PRICE: Weve we there is a track record. These statements do not come in a vacuum. And the track record that we have seen over the past year and a half or so speaks to the fact that the Iranians have not and may not ever be in a position to move forward with a swift return to compliance with the JCPOA. Time and again, on several occasions now, we thought we were close. The rest of the world thought we were close the E3, the other members of the P5+1 only to have the rug pulled out from under us by the Iranians.\n\nDespite these statements from the Iranians, what were focused on now are whats happening in the streets of Iran the bravery, the determination, the courage of the Iranian people, especially its women and girls to take to the streets to express their universal rights. And were also at the same time focused on what Iran is enabling Russia to do, and thats also a primary concern of ours.\n\nQUESTION: Just to clarify, theres a huge difference between the deal is not on the agenda and the deal is dead. The President of the United States is on the record saying that the deal is dead, and I think that part of the story is established already. Now the question is lets talk about the killers. So what are you going to do to hold Iranian mullah regime accountable for murdering Iranians and murdering the deal?\n\nMR PRICE: So we have taken steps to make clear that we stand resolutely with the Iranian people, who are exercising their universal rights by taking to the streets, voicing their grievances, voicing their aspirations, as they have every single right to do. We have taken steps to enable them to do that more effectively through the general licenses that we issue that allow technology companies to provide hardware and software to the Iranian people to allow them to speak, to communicate with one another and with the outside world so that, importantly, the rest of the world can see we can hear precisely what is going on inside of Iran. Thats important for us. Its important for the protesters that they be heard by the rest of the world, just as that they are demanding that they be heard by the Iranian regime.\n\nAt the same time, we have now taken undertaken multiple rounds of sanctions against those who are responsible for the repression, who are responsible for the bloodshed, the violent crackdown, the attempts to cut off Iran from the rest of the world, the internet blackouts. We have taken now multiple rounds of sanctions. Were always looking at additional steps we can take. Were always looking for additional targets who may be responsible, whether thats on human rights grounds, whether thats on any other ground for which we have an authority to pull from.\n\nQUESTION: A need to sanction the supreme leader of Iran, who is actually sitting atop of all this brutal regime?\n\nMR PRICE: We are going to take the steps that we feel are within the bounds of the law and that are appropriate to support the people of Iran and to hold accountable the regime.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMR PRICE: Guita.\n\nQUESTION: Ned, you just mentioned internet blackouts, and Sunday and Monday there was total blackout excuse me apparently. You also mentioned the general license and everything. Are you hearing from the private sector, the technology companies if theres room still to help the people?\n\nMR PRICE: We are having a discussion with the private sector. Its a discussion thats been going on since the earliest days of these protests in Iran. We want their ideas. We do not have a monopoly on good ideas when it comes to steps we could take that would help the people of Iran fulfill their aspirations. You may recall that early on in these protests, Deputy Secretary Sherman met with a representatives of various technology companies. Weve continued to have discussions with technologists on additional steps we might be able to take.\n\nBut with the general license that we issued in the earliest days of this protest, it is a versatile tool in that it is self-executing. And so it provides technology companies with essentially a green light to provide their wares to the people of Iran if they themselves deem that their technology is covered by the general license. The general license is a general license rather than a specific license, meaning that its also broad in its scope. And so there are a number of tools and a number of capabilities that this general license authorized that previously may not have been on the table.\n\nSo if technology companies, if the private sector more broadly, if other governments have good ideas as to additional steps we could take that would enable the Iranian people to communicate with one another and with the outside world, were of course all ears to that and well work with them on implementing them.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask one specifically on Iran?\n\nMR PRICE: Sure.\n\nQUESTION: Taraneh Alidoosti, arguably one of the best known or one of the most acclaimed actors, actresses in Iran was detained over the weekend over social media post. Do you have any reaction specifically to her arrest?\n\nMR PRICE: We do. We condemn the arrest of Taraneh Alidoosti. Unfortunately, Ms. Alidoosti only joins the ranks of thousands of other Iranians who have been detained simply for acts of peaceful protest. Ms. Alidoosti is only the latest cultural icon to be detained, along with many other actors, journalists, students, athletes, lawyers, and human rights defenders. Its part of the regimes effort to sow fear and to suppress these peaceful protests. We call on Iranian authorities to cease the arbitrary detentions and to stop denying the Iranian people their fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful assembly. And the world, as weve been saying for some time now, will be watching how the regime treats Ms. Alidoosti and all those it has detained arbitrarily.\n\nDylan. Dylan.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, quick question on China. Congress put out its government funding bill this morning. It included the full ban of TikTok on government devices. Youve said before when asked about this, this specific application, that youve raised general cyber security privacy issues with China. This bill specifically names this application. Theres a lot of theres a lot of clamoring for a ban, coming from both parties now at this point in Congress, of this specific application. So what have you said to China about specifically that app and concerns about it?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, this is not an app that we are permitted to have on our government-issued phones here at the State Department, I think for reasons that are probably clear. I think the it is less a conversation that weve had with the PRC and its more a conversation that were having with allies and partners around the world, and with the American people. Because what we want to do is to sensitize stakeholders around the world partners, allies, and the American people to the potential dangers that technology may pose, especially when its foreign-owned or when theres a foreign stake and that foreign country is a competitor or an adversary, or has been known to use the data of private American citizens for nefarious purposes. We want to make those concerns known. We want to have a shared approach with countries around the world, and we want to make sure that the American people at the very least appreciate the risks when it comes to their personal privacy and personal data.\n\nQUESTION: So its not something youre speaking to with them directly, China, about it?\n\nMR PRICE: We have a relationship where we are in a position to discuss with one another the stark disagreements we have, the challenges that the PRC poses to us and to our allies and partners, including when it comes to technology. I think its fair to say that the PRC Government knows where we stand, how concerned we are. But I think perhaps the more important conversation is the conversation that were having with the American people, and that were having with allies and partners to harmonize that approach.\n\nOkay, final question? Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you so much. Two final, if you dont mind. Georgia. Mikheil Saakashvili, former president, in jail. But we all have seen pictures coming out of jail. He is not in good shape. His doctors American doctors also recommended that he needs to be taken out of the country. Has the embassy or the department been in touch with Georgian authorities on this topic?\n\nMR PRICE: So we have when in it comes to Mr. Saakashvili, we as you said before, its a responsibility of the Georgian Government to treat Mr. Saakashvili fairly and with dignity, including by providing all necessary medical and psychological treatment as recommended by the independent public defenders medical experts. They should ensure, of course, that his human rights are protected, and that he is receiving every bit of care that he needs.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. And lastly, on Azerbaijan, leading activist and U.S.-educated Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, he is on hunger strike in jail. Its been six days now, and today the court refused to release him. There are reports that he is actually is a subject to torture. I know Vedant, last time he was behind this podium, he addressed the topic and expressed the departments position on this.\n\nI also know that there are Azeri officials in this building last week, talking to U.S. officials. Has the topic been discussed? Did it come up during the discussions? And also, are you going to (inaudible) Azeri authorities through the embassy or through other channels to follow up on this case?\n\nMR PRICE: Well, we you heard from us last week, you heard from Vedant last week just how troubled we are and we were by the arrest and the detention of Mr. Hajiyev on the eve, at the time, of Human Rights Day. Weve urged Azerbaijan authorities to release him expeditiously. These are conversations that we are in a position to have privately through diplomatic channels with our partners. We dont hesitate to raise human rights broadly, systemically, but also individual cases with our partners around the world. And that, of course, includes our partners in Azerbaijan.\n\nThank you all very much.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:12 p.m.)",

Reuters reports that, earlier, he renewed calls for more weapons after Russian drones hit energy targets in a third air strike on power facilities in six days. In his evening address, he said: Weapons, shells, new defence capabilities everything that will give us the ability to speed up the end to this war. Ukraines military said it had shot down 30 of 35 \"kamikaze\" drones fired by Russia on Monday, mostly at the capital, Kyiv. The unmanned aircraft fly towards their target, then plummet and detonate on impact. Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday that five people had been killed in the eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson regions, with eight wounded, and that 21 missiles had knocked out power in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 13.50 EST Summary The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Heres a summary of the latest events: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited the frontline city of Bakhmut. He met military representatives and handed out awards to soldiers, his office has said.\n\nA blast ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline that leads from Russia through Ukraine. Reuters reported that three people died in the incident.\n\nUkraine was warned to prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Moscow wanted his people to spend Christmas and new year in darkness.\n\nRussias president, Vladimir Putin, said the situation in four areas of eastern Ukraine Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Moscow illegally annexed in September, was \"extremely difficult\". Russias illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions.\n\nThe EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday condemned Irans support for Russia in its war in Ukraine and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. \"Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amid deteriorating Iran-EU relations,\" Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan.\n\nUkraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others including heroes of this years war. Following Moscows invasion that has killed or injured untold numbers of civilians and soldiers and pummelled buildings and infrastructure, Ukraines leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its communist past into one of \"de-Russification\".\n\nChina says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to \"further deepen\" cooperation between the sides whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscows invasion of Ukraine, AP reports. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by Chinas eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist partys military wing, the Peoples Liberation Army.\n\nPutin was in Belarus on Monday, where he and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, hardly mentioning the war raging in nearby Ukraine, conducted a late-night joint news conference, Reuters reports. Russian forces used Belarus as a launchpad for their abortive attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in February, and there has been Russian and Belarusian military activity there for months.\n\nAsked about Putins comment dismissing the prospect of Russia \"absorbing\" Belarus, the US state department spokesperson Ned Price said it should be treated as the \"height of irony\", given it was \"coming from a leader who is seeking at the present moment, right now, to violently absorb his other peaceful nextdoor neighbour\". He added that Washington would continue to watch very closely whether or not Belarus would provide additional support to Putin and would respond \"appropriately\" if it did.\n\nRussias foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Sergei Aleinik, in Minsk ahead of Putins visit. The foreign ministers discussed \"specific topical issues, the efforts to counter the illegal sanctions of the west, as well as interaction on international platforms\", Belarusian state media cited Belaruss foreign ministry as saying, as well as having \"touched upon trade and economic cooperation matters and the implementation of joint projects\".\n\nZelenskiy urged Georgia on Monday to allow its jailed former president to go abroad for treatment to safeguard his health.\n\nMikheil Saakashvili, president of Georgia from 2004 to 2013, was initially credited with implementing reforms. He was later sentenced to six years in prison on abuse of power charges his supporters say are politically motivated.\n\nBelaruss defence ministry said it had completed a series of inspections of its armed forces military preparedness, hours ahead of Putins visit to Minsk. Weeks of military manoeuvres and inspections have raised fears in Kyiv that Belarus could be preparing to take a more active role in the conflict once again.\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for \"all possible defence scenarios\" against Moscow and its ally. \"Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority,\" Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraines top military command. \"We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios.\" Were pausing this live blog for now, but will reopen it should there be any major developments.\n\nUpdated at 15.00 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 12.54 EST Two Turkish military transport aircraft that had been stranded in Ukraine since the beginning of the war 10 months ago safely returned to Turkey on Tuesday, the defence ministry has said. Reuters reports that the two Airbus A400M military transport planes of the Turkish air force had flown to Kyiv-Boryspil airport just as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The defence ministry said the two aircraft had gone to Kyiv to deliver humanitarian supplies and evacuate Turkish citizens, but became stuck at Kyivs airport when Ukrainian air space was closed due to the outbreak of hostilities. The two aircraft left Ukraine on Tuesday afternoon and arrived at the airport in the central Turkish city of Kayseri in the evening, a defence ministry statement said.\n\nUpdated at 13.03 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 11.55 EST Ukraine should prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, warns its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, saying Moscow wants his people to spend Christmas and new year in darkness. He made his remarks after a series of Russian missile and drone strikes that Ukrainian officials say have left electricity supplies in the Kyiv region at a critically low level, with less than half the capitals power needs being met. Reuters quotes him as telling a government meeting: \"Repairs continue but the situation remains really difficult,\" adding that eight nuclear power units and 10 thermal power stations were operating, but that the energy deficit was \"significant\". Russian terrorists will do everything to leave Ukrainians without electricity for the new year. It is important for them for Christmas and the new year to take place in darkness in Ukraine. Thats why we should prepare for new attacks. Moscow says attacks on basic infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime.\n\nUpdated at 12.01 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 11.00 EST Ukraine has revoked the press accreditation of the Danish state broadcaster DRs correspondent over allegations of having spread Russian propaganda, DR has said, prompting denials from both the journalist and her employer. Reuters reports that Matilde Kimer, an award-winning journalist who has covered Ukraine and Russia for DR since 2014, said Ukraine initially revoked her accreditation in August. At a December meeting in Kyiv, the Ukrainian security service (SBU) alleged that she was spreading Russian propaganda and that her social media posts appeared to sympathise with Russia, Kimer told Reuters. According to her, the security service did not provide evidence of their allegations. Neither the SBU, nor the Ukrainian defence ministry immediately responded to written requests for comment when contacted by Reuters. DRs foreign policy editor, Niels Kvale, called the allegations \"completely undocumented and crazy\" and Kimer herself denied biased reporting. I have not engaged in propaganda. I work with no other task than to inform Danes about what is going on in Ukraine. Kimer, 41, was also expelled from Russia in August amid Moscows crackdown on western media outlets following its invasion. The Danish foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told Reuters he would work to resolve the matter at a political level. I myself have followed Matilde Kimers coverage of the war with great interest. This is a journalist whose journalistic integrity, as far as I know, has not been questioned.\n\nUpdated at 11.28 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 10.58 EST About a quarter of Ukraines population some 10 million people may suffer from a mental health disorder in relation to the conflict, the World Health Organizations representative in the country, Jarno Habicht, has said. Disorders likely to be seen include anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by distressing events. Cases are rising after 10 months of conflict, prompting a separate UN agency to launch online support services. Reuters reports that Ukraines health care system has been under pressure since Russia invaded in February. So far, there have been at least 700 attacks on its health care system, WHO data shows, and Russias increase in attacks on critical infrastructure since October has added to the challenges by causing blackouts. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Habicht said respiratory diseases would increase with the cold weather and insufficient heating, as would car accidents on unlit streets due to blackouts. The health system is functioning. But as it is 10 months its a huge stress test. We are constantly seeing new challenges.\n\nUpdated at 11.24 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 10.21 EST In the UKs House of Commons, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is giving evidence to the liaison committee. He is asked if he will \"commit to supporting Ukraine\" amid concern about his audit of the war. Sunak says he would not read too much into the reports about the audit. Look at the support for Ukraine he has shown. Of course he will continue to back Ukraine, he says. Sunak says the UK wants to give Ukraine what they need. The priorities are air defence, armoured vehicles and artillery ammunition. He says munitions are being replenished. The issue is less money than supply chain capacity, he says. Asked about homelessness among Ukrainian refugees in the UK, Sunak starts by paying tribute to families who have hosted those who have fled the war. He says the thank-you payments were recently extended, and made more generous. And he adds that 150m has gone to councils to allow them to mitigate homelessness. Lord Harrington, the former minister for refugees, says payments should be doubled (from 350 to 700). They only went up to 500 for families after a year of hosting someone. He asks Sunak: cant you be more generous? Sunak says some financial assistance has been provided, but adds that it is also a matter of what can be afforded.\n\nUpdated at 10.45 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 09.52 EST There are conflicting views in Russia on whether or not to launch a counteroffensive in Ukraine, a senior state department official said on Tuesday, but reiterated that Washington would continue its support of Kyiv regardless of which scenario played out. \"Certainly there are some [within Russia] who I think would want to pursue offensives in Ukraine. There are others who have real questions about the capacity for Russia to actually do that,\" a senior state department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. Ukraines top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring, Reuters reported.\n\nUpdated at 10.46 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 09.20 EST Russia intends to give Iran advanced military components in exchange for hundreds of drones, the British defence minister, Ben Wallace, said on Tuesday. \"Iran has become one of Russias top military backers,\" Wallace told parliament as part of a statement on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \"In return for having supplied more than 300 kamikaze drones, Russia now intends to provide Iran with advanced military components, undermining both Middle East and international security.\" 00:00:55 Iran has become one of Russias top military backers in Ukraine, says Ben Wallace video\n\nUpdated at 10.39 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 09.07 EST Pjotr Sauer Vladimir Putin has made a rare admission of his countrys military challenges in the 10-month-old war in Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited a key city in eastern Ukraine that Moscow has failed to capture despite months of relentless shelling. In a video message addressed to Russias security services, Putin said the situation in the four Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions was \"extremely complicated\", and urged security agencies to intensify their efforts to identify \"traitors, spies and diversionists\". The video was released on a special holiday dedicated to Russias powerful security services. Putins speech sheds light on Moscows growing acknowledgment that the war in Ukraine is not going to plan. Earlier this month, the Russian leader said the conflict in Ukraine could turn into a \"long-term process\", after Moscow was forced to abandon some of the territories it annexed illegally in September, notably fleeing the city of Kherson. Putins message on Tuesday came hours before Zelenskiys office announced that the Ukrainian leader had made a surprise visit to the embattled city of Bakhmut, which has largely been ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the \"Bakhmut meat-grinder\". Putin admits to complicated situation in Russian-occupied Ukraine Read more\n\nUpdated at 09.32 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 08.40 EST Polands PKN Orlen will not extend a contract for Russian oil that expires in January 2023, and a second long-term contract will cease to be implemented when sanctions are introduced, Reuters quotes the refiner as saying, confirming an earlier report by the Polish agency PAP. PKN Orlen will not extend the long-term contract, which expires in January 2023. The only binding contract for the supply of Russian oil in 2023 will cease to be implemented when the sanctions are introduced, for which we are prepared.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 08.09 EST We reported earlier that a blast had ripped through a gas pipeline in central Russia. Citing the Tass news agency, Reuters is now reporting that three people died in the incident. Reuters says local officials wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the flow of gas through the section of the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod pipeline had been cut as of 1.50pm local time (10.50am GMT). Tass cited local emergency services as saying three people had died and one had been injured. The Chuvashia regional emergencies ministry said the pipeline had blown up during planned maintenance work near the village of Kalinino, about 90 miles (150km) west of the Volga city of Kazan. It said the resulting gas flare had been extinguished. The pipeline, built in the 1980s, enters Ukraine via the Sudzha metering point; currently the main route for Russian gas to reach Europe. The head office of the state-owned gas producer Gazprom and its local branch did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Gazprom had said earlier on Tuesday that it expected to pump 43m cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine through Sudzha in the next 24 hours; a volume in line with recent days.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 07.53 EST The office of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has released several images it says show him in Bakhmut; the scene of heavy recent fighting.

Ukrainians generally celebrate Christmas on 7 January in common with Russians but the countrys Orthodox church has gradually shifted from Moscows orbit in recent years. Following Russias invasion of Ukraine this year, the church has said congregations can now also celebrate on 25 December something many refugees said they would embrace. Svetlana Safonova, 48, said when she fled Lviv in March she did not imagine she would have to spend Christmas away from her husband and adult daughter, who serves in the Ukraine army. Safonova, who plans to make traditional potato dumplings with her 9-year-old son and her nieces family, said: We would like to celebrate on 25 December to respect Bulgaria and show one more time we are cutting off ties with Russia. We will go to an Orthodox church and pray for peace in Ukraine and for the health of our soldiers and children. Vasil, 45, and Marina, 36, Khymyshynets who fled their village near Kyiv in March with their two children after a missile or artillery round exploded near their house, now live in a two-room flat in Prague. The family, who could not afford a tree because they were saving to send gifts to relatives in Ukraine, baked Christmas cookies and taped pine branches and Christmas lights on the wall while the children practiced singing carols in Czech. We decided to just use some pine branches for the decoration so that it looks good and makes the children happy.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 07.19 EST A blast has ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline, which leads from Russia through Ukraine, Reuters reports, citing the RBC news outlet. According to RBC, the regional emergency ministry in Russias Chuvash Republic where the accident took place, near the Volga city of Kazan, said it had received a call about a fire at a gas pipeline, without naming the pipeline. It said that, according to preliminary information, no one has been injured in the incident.\n\nUpdated at 11.52 EST\n\n20 Dec 2022 06.33 EST Zelenskiy visits frontline city The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the frontline city of Bakhmut to meet military representatives and hand out awards to soldiers, his office has said.

We have only one dispute: Who is the bigger one? Thats all,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nAs Putin approaches New Years Eve, the 23rd anniversary of his appointment in 1999 as acting Russian president, he appears more isolated than ever.\n\nMore than 300 days of brutal war against Ukraine have blown up decades of Russias carefully cultivated economic relations with the West, turning the country into a pariah, while Kremlin efforts to replace those ties with closer cooperation with India and China appear to be faltering the longer the war grinds on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin, who started his career as a Soviet KGB agent, has always kept his own counsel, relying on a close inner circle of old friends and confidants while seeming to never fully trust or confide in anyone. But now a new gulf is emerging between Putin and much of the countrys elite, according to interviews with Russian business leaders, officials and analysts.\n\nPutin \"feels the loss of his friends,\" said one Russian state official with close ties to diplomatic circles, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"Lukashenko is the only one he can pay a serious visit to. All the rest see him only when necessary.\"\n\nOn Dec. 7, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the war in Ukraine would be \"a long process,\" but that there was no reason to mobilize additional soldiers. (Video: Reuters)\n\nEven though Putin gathered leaders of former Soviet republics for an informal summit in St. Petersburg this week, across the region the Kremlins authority is weakening. Putin spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping over video conference on Friday morning in Moscow in an effort to showcase the two countries ties. Although Xi said he was ready to improve strategic cooperation, he acknowledged the \"complicated and quite controversial international situation.\" In September, hed made clear his \"concerns\" over the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndias Narendra Modi this month wrote an article for Russias influential Kommersant daily calling for an end to \"the epoch of war.\" \"We read all this and understand, and I think he [Putin] reads and understands too,\" the state official said.\n\nEven the pope, who at the beginning of the war appeared to take care to accommodate Kremlin views, this month compared the war in Ukraine to the Nazi genocide of the Jews.\n\nAmong Russias elite, questions are growing over Putins tactics heading into 2023 following humiliating military retreats this autumn. A divide is emerging between those in the elite who want Putin to stop the military onslaught and those who believe he must escalate further, according to the state official and Tatyana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nDespite a media blitz over the past 10 days, with Putin holding carefully choreographed televised meetings with military top brass and officials from the military-industrial complex, as well as a question-and-answer session with a selected pool of loyal journalists, members of the Russian elite interviewed by The Washington Post said they could not predict what might happen next year and said they doubted Putin himself knew how he might act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is huge frustration among the people around him,\" said one Russian billionaire who maintains contacts with top-ranking officials. \"He clearly doesnt know what to do.\"\n\nThe Russian state official said Putins only plan appeared to lie in \"constant attempts to force the West and Ukraine to begin [peace] talks\" through airstrikes on Ukraines critical infrastructure and other threats. Putin repeated the tactic this week by declaring on Christmas Day that he was open to peace talks even as Russia launched another massive missile strike just days later on Thursday, taking out electricity supplies in several regions. \"But,\" the official said, Putin is willing to talk \"only on his terms.\"\n\nThe billionaire, the state official and several analysts pointed to the postponement of Putins annual State of the Nation address, when the Russian president generally lays out plans for the year ahead, and the cancellation of his annual marathon news conference as signs of Putins isolation and an effort to shield him from direct questions since he has no map for the road ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news conference, in particular, could have proved risky given that hundreds of journalists are typically brought to Moscow from Russias far-flung regions, which have been disproportionately affected by casualties and the recent partial mobilization.\n\n\"In the address, there should be a plan. But there is no plan. I think they just dont know what to say,\" the billionaire said. \"He is in isolation, of course. He doesnt like speaking with people anyway. He has a very narrow circle, and now it has gotten narrower still.\"\n\nIn the question-and-answer session with the handful of journalists, Putin countered such assertions about the postponement of his speech to parliament. He said he had addressed key issues in recent public meetings, and it was \"complicated for me, and the administration, to squeeze it all again into a formal address without repeating myself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut his comments on the war have been short on details. He has gone no further than saying conditions in the four Ukrainian territories that he claims to have annexed, illegally, are \"extremely difficult,\" and that his government would try to end the conflict \"the faster, the better.\"\n\nPutin again sought to lay the blame on the United States and NATO for dragging out the war, in what seemed almost a tacit admission that he had lost control of the process. \"How can he tell us everything is going to plan, when we are already in the 10th month of the war, and we were told it was only going to take a few days,\" the state official said.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nPutin appeared exhausted in his recent appearances, Stanovaya said. And even if he does have a secret plan of action, most of the Russian elite is losing faith in him, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a figure who in the eyes of the elite appears to be incapable of giving answers to questions,\" she said. \"The elite does not know what to believe, and they fear to think about tomorrow.\"\n\n\"To a large degree, there is the feeling that there is no way out, that the situation is irreparable,\" she continued, \"that they are totally dependent on one person, and it is impossible to influence anything.\"\n\nAlexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russias Central Bank who resigned and left Russia in the weeks after the start of the invasion, said in an interview that her former colleagues \"try not see the war in terms of winners and losers. But they know there is no good exit for Russia right now.\"\n\n\"There is a feeling that we cannot attain the political aims that were originally forwarded,\" the state official said. \"This is clear to all.\" But no one knows how large a loss Russia can sustain before its leaders believe its existence is in jeopardy, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther underscoring the growing distance between the president and the business elite, Putin also canceled his annual New Years Eve meeting with the countrys billionaires, officially citing infection risks.\n\nWith such a huge question mark hanging over the year ahead, two camps have emerged within the elite: \"The pragmatists who consider that Russia took on the burden of a war it cant sustain and needs to stop,\" and those who want to escalate, Stanovaya said.\n\nThose in favor of escalation include Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the Putin ally who leads the Wagner Group of mercenaries and continues to publicly berate Russias military leadership.\n\nThe growing split presents Putin with yet another risk as he heads into 2023, the last year before presidential elections in 2024.\n\nEven though recent polls show Putin retains the support of the vast majority of the population, who for now continue to accept Kremlin propaganda, the overwhelming perception among the elite is that next year, things could become more precarious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We dont know what will happen in the future,\" said a longtime member of Russian diplomatic circles, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \"There might be another wave of mobilization. The economic situation in the next year will start to worsen more seriously.\"\n\nSergei Markov, a hawkish former Kremlin adviser who is still in contact with Putins team, said it was clear Putin still did not have an answer to the principal question ahead of him. \"There are two possible paths ahead,\" Markov said. \"One is that the army continues to fight while the rest of society lives a normal life as it was this year. The second path is as it was when Russia went through World War II, when everything was for the front and for victory. There was such a mobilization of society and the economy.\"\n\nThere are also inescapable questions about glaring weaknesses in the Russian military that have become apparent in recent months, including its evident inability to properly train and equip the 300,000 called up during the autumn mobilization.\n\n\"The fact is that these 300,000 mobilized do not have enough weapons,\" Markov said. \"When will they get the military technology? Putin also does not have the answer to this question.\"\n\nAccording to Markov, who supports escalation, Indias and Chinas doubts have arisen because Putin did not win fast enough. \"Privately they say, Win quicker, but if you cant win, we cant build good relations with you,\" he said. \"You should either win or admit your loss. We need most of all for the war to end as fast as possible.\"\n\nOthers said the reason for the tepid relations with Indias and Chinas leaders was because they were clearly more worried about further escalation. \"We hear there is a worry about the prospect of escalation to the nuclear level,\" the longtime member of Russian diplomatic circles said. \"And here, it seems to me everyone spoke very clearly that this is extremely undesirable and dangerous.\"\n\nInside Russia, every now and then, members of the liberal-leaning elite are voicing their growing concern.\n\nIn an interview last week with Russian daily RBK, Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of Otkritie, one of Russias biggest banks, who served as finance minister from 1997 to 1999, noted that Russia had lost markets in the West that it had been building since Soviet times. \"For 50 years, a market, mutual economic connections, were being built. Now they are destroyed for decades to come,\" Zadornov said.",

So why is defence minister Sergei Shoigu there?\n\nThis is also his second trip to Minsk this month. On 3 December he showed up unexpectedly and signed some form of defence pact with the Belarusian Defence Minister, though the details are unknown. It suggests that something's up.\n\nImage: Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, speaks to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at the National Airport Minsk in Minsk, Belarus. Pic: AP\n\nThe Kremlin press secretary, also in Minsk, dismissed speculation that the purpose of the trip was to tell the Belarusian leader to scale up his involvement in the war. Such reports were \"groundless\" and \"stupid\", Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nMr Peskov also repeatedly denied in February that Russia had any intention of invading Ukraine.\n\nIn what seems unlikely to be a coincidence, the Belarusian military announced just ahead of Mr Putin's arrival that it had completed military readiness checks.\n\nThat essentially means it has sized up the capacity of its military reserves, which could be a precursor to mobilisation. It certainly was in Russia.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 'Miles of trenches' are being dug by Russian forces in the east of the country.\n\n\"The Belarusian armed forces have been exercising a lot since April. It is possibly the most active they have been since the end of the Cold War\", says Konrad Muzyka a security analyst with Rochan Consulting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you add to that all the mobilisation efforts they have undertaken over the past few months, checking the data of reservists, bringing them into military offices to confirm their residential data and so on and so forth, this indicates that the Belarusian role in this war could change in the near future.\"\n\nCommitting Belarusian troops to the battle would be extremely unpopular back home and could carry risks for Lukashenko's regime.\n\n\"Will you be so popular among your military and law enforcement if you threw them into the unpopular meat grinder? This is an open question\", says Artyom Shraibman, an expert on Belarus for the Carnegie Endownment Centre.\n\nImage: Russian troops take part in drills at an unspecified location in Belarus.

Since nationwide unrest around the disputed presidential elections in 2020, he is in Russia's debt and at its mercy.\n\nMr Shraibman expects him to resist Russian pressure, but says Mr Putin's demands and potential outcomes are hard to predict.\n\nBelarus is already facilitating Russia's prosecution of this war in all manner of ways, from training Russia's freshly mobilised to looking after Russian wounded, from diverting supplies and kit such as tanks or clothing to allowing Russia free rein to use its territory as a launchpad for land and air attacks.\n\nRead more\n\nUkraine 'preparing' for Russia to invade from north\n\nUkrainians could die from the freezing cold due to Russian power grid attacks\n\nCommitting the Belarusian armed forces as well is not outside the realm of possibility, although currently Russia looks more in need of supplies and ammunition than further, possibly unskilled, manpower.\n\n\"Currently, if Belarus were to go to war now without any mobilisation, they could deploy 15,000 to 18,000 men, so it's a very small complement (to Russian forces)\", says Mr Muzyka.\n\n\"But let's see how many men they can deploy if they mobilise because there's talk of numbers as high as 200,000.

                "cc_text": "Russias war on Ukraine has sparked a variety of debates among scholars in the West. Basically, there seem to be two lines of thought, which can be further subdivided into different themes. The first is that the war is a brutal, unprovoked attack to which the West must respond, by providing Ukraine with the means to resist in the shape of various weapons, including the HIMARS and most recently the US Patriot missile. The second, and the subject of this commentary, is that Russia is fighting a defensive war to prevent further advances of NATO, and the danger of a nuclear strike on Russia, and to assert control over its natural spheres of interest, i.e., the territories of the former Soviet Union.\n\nAccording to American political scientist John Mearsheimer, \"the United States is principally responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis,\" He adds further that:\n\nMy central claim is that the United States has pushed forward policies toward Ukraine that Putin and other Russian leaders see as an existential threat, a point they have made repeatedly for many years. Specifically, I am talking about Americas obsession with bringing Ukraine into NATO and making it a Western bulwark on Russias border. The Biden administration was unwilling to eliminate that threat through diplomacy and indeed in 2021 recommitted the United States to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Putin responded by invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 of this year.\n\nFrench scholar, Marlene Laruelle, thinks that the West needs to consider its own role in the current war and repeats the Kremlins mantra that the war derives from NATO expansion. Added to this second narrative are statements that this is a \"normal war\" that is not especially brutal and which can be compared to other wars taking place in the 20th and 21st centuries. Military historian Alexander Hill maintains that some Western scholars are taking an emotional stance based on a bombardment of media attention that is not accorded to other wars taking place in Yemen and Africa. The second narrative presupposes that a peace treaty is possible, even if it means forcing Ukraine to relinquish its territory, though the difficulties involved have been elaborated carefully by Eric Levitz and cites a statement from the Royal United Services Institute that a ceasefire is \"tactically advantageous to Russia as it would allow the occupants to stabilize the lands they have occupied.\n\nMy purpose here is to make a case that the second narrative is deeply flawed, and that there is evidence to back up the claim that this is not a typical war or one linked to NATO expansion or neo-Nazism, but rather one initiated by Moscow and calculated to destroy a sovereign state regardless of civilian losses. It is also one conducted by a terrorist regime that does not engage in traditional diplomacy or its rules.\n\nOne can dismiss the various statements of Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov and others early in 2022 that the goal was to de-Nazify and de-militarize Ukraine or that the war was a response to the expansion of NATO, particularly in the period 19992004, when its members could be found on the old Soviet western border as well as the inclusion of former Soviet republics Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. From the outset, the primary military goal was to remove a democratically elected government and replace it with one that would either be Russian or fiercely pro-Russian, and to destroy all vestiges of the current state of Ukraine. The initial attack came from the territory of Belarus and focused on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.\n\nRussian optimism in military planning derived from the earlier conflict of 2014 when Russia easily annexed Crimea and imposed separatist regimes in the eastern Donbas. At that time, the Ukrainian army was badly led, corrupt, and inefficient, and loyalty to the provisional government under acting president Oleksandr Turchynov was at best questionable among the residents of eastern and southern Ukraine. Many Ukrainians in these regions opposed the Euromaidan uprising of 2013-14. Later, they were hardly satiated by the presidency of Petro Poroshenko, an oligarch who embraced the Ukrainian nationalist cause yet failed to address the countrys economic needs. By 2019, Poroshenko was a very unpopular figure and Ukraine the poorest country in Europe.\n\nPutin may have also gained confidence from the Minsk Accords of 2014, in which Germany and France appeared to acknowledge the legitimacy of the two breakaway republics in Donetsk and Luhansk leaders of both signed the Accords along with Ukraine and Russia. The Accords forced Ukraine to demilitarize while Russia used the armistice to build up its army.\n\nThat Putin has an obsession with Ukraine had been evident for most of his presidency. He has never recognized Ukrainian independence or the very concept of Ukraine as a sovereign state. Rather, Ukrainian independence in his view was granted by Russia after the revolution of 1917 and the formation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic:\n\nThis Soviet national policy secured at the state level the provision on three separate Slavic peoples: Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian, instead of the large Russian nation, a triune people comprising Velikorussians [Great Russians], Malorussians [Little Russians] and Belorussians.\n\nPutin perceives modern Ukraine as a Western creation and the real Ukraine as component part of Greater Russia, along with Belarus. The three East Slavic states are linked, he believes historically, culturally, and linguistically, and united in a common Orthodox religion. But they are all instrinsically Russian, there can be no separate Belarus or Ukraine. Further, the mindset of the Russian leadership is crudely imperial. While the official narratives have focused on the \"Great Patriotic War\" and Russias victory over the Nazi hordes, the mind of the Russian president more precisely is in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Russian lands were expanded at the expense of Poland and the Ottoman Empire. Other than Austrian Galicia with its capital Lemberg (Lviv), all Ukrainian lands lay in the Russian Empire. Even Lviv was occupied by the Russian army early in the First World War.\n\nRather than accept that Ukrainians have unified behind President Volodymyr Zelensky and rejected the Russian invasion, Putin and his Security Council anticipate a lengthy war of destruction to reach their goals, however long it takes. If the Russian armies fail on the battlefield, as they have repeatedly since February 24, 2022, then they intend to destroy Ukrainians per se: through missiles, deprivation of basic needs, deportation of children, massacres of prisoners, and annexation and Russification of its territory.\n\nThis war cannot be ended by what might be termed \"normal diplomacy,\" or new Minsk Accords. No negotiations are possible when the leadership of a large country with a massive store of weapons, including nuclear ones, wishes to destroy a smaller one comprising its immediate neighbour.\n\nIronically, the attack undermines the concept of the Eastern Slavs, since fraternal partners do not destroy each other. Even in the largest conflict in history, the Second World War, the victors did not attempt to eliminate the German people when it ended; or the Japanese at the end of the Pacific War. No matter that the Nazi leaders had tried to destroy European Jewry, Roma, and other victims, there was still a Germany after 1945.\n\nOne should add that the leadership in Moscow is made up of former security officials of the Soviet Union, police, and oligarchs. They are linked to almost unimaginable crimes: poisoning their political opponents with radioactive Poloniumsometimes outside the country as well as withinamassing stupendous wealth at the expense of their people, and using social media to expand outrageous narratives about the leaders of Ukraine and their Western allies.\n\nThere can of course be counter-narratives about US military raids on various places, the 1999 NATO attack on Belgrade, which outraged many neutrals, the US-led war in Iraq, etc. The worlds largest Super Power can hardly be held up as a model for world peace and one can acknowledge that. But there was always a stated goal that contained some logic, such as the removal of Saddam Hussein, the need to protect Serbian victims such as Bosnian Muslims or Albanians, or to combat terrorism, which was a preoccupation of Russia in the 1990s too.\n\nThe record is sad and riddled with errors but it is not that of a state bent on ethnocide, nor did it detract from the democratic foundations of the United States. Under Putin, Russia has become an authoritarian and repressive state, or what one analyst has termed \"hybrid totalitarianism.\" One can more realistically compare the sort of ethnic cleansing carried out in Ukraine with the genocide of Armenians in 1915, the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the 1995 Srebenica massacre, and others. These are logical comparisons, based on what we have seen in Russian occupied locations such as Bucha and Mariupol.\n\nThe scale of the current war lacks a precedent in the 21st century. Russia is the largest military power in the world in several areas. It has sophisticated weapons. It has the worlds largest nuclear arsenal, which Putin and former president Dmitry Medvedev, now Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, have threatened repeatedly to use. Medvedev has also called for the \"liquidation of Ukrainian statehood in its current form.\" It is also a war in which a leadership expends its troops at will with Russian mortalities running into the tens of thousands. A new draft saw thousands more heading to the borders to avoid conscription.\n\nUltimately, the Russian army consists of those without means, unable to register in colleges or universities and usually from the regions of the Caucasus or Far East. Their morale is reportedly very low. The real effects of the war are invisible for the most part in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Putins new conscription order in September led to a mass flight of potential recruits to neighbouring Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThe Russian leadership seeks to depopulate and destroy the entity that since 1991 has existed as the independent Ukrainian state, held regular elections with six different presidents to date, has shown the firmest of wills to resist, and believes its future. Ukrainians want to live in Ukraine, not Russia. By what possible argument can this situation be considered a typical war? And the inconceivability of coming up with a solution that can satisfy the desires of Vladimir Putin and his acolytes leaves open only one option: to support Ukraine until it has liberated its lands, whether or not that also signifies a change of regime in Moscow following Russias defeat or whether it results in a period of political and social chaos for the worlds largest country. The alternative is the end of independent Ukraine.\n\nFurther Reading on E-International Relations",

                "cc_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine was meant to be his crowning achievement, a demonstration of how far Russia had come since the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991. Annexing Ukraine was supposed to be a first step in reconstructing a Russian empire. Putin intended to expose the United States as a paper tiger outside Western Europe and to demonstrate that Russia, along with China, was destined for a leadership role in a new, multipolar international order.\n\nIt hasnt turned out that way. Kyiv held strong, and the Ukrainian military has been transformed into a juggernaut, thanks in part to a close partnership with the United States and Western allies. The Russian military, in contrast, has demonstrated poor strategic thinking and organization. The political system behind it has proved unable to learn from its mistakes. With little prospect of dictating Putins actions, the West will have to prepare for the next stage of Russias disastrous war of choice.\n\nWar is inherently unpredictable. Indeed, the course of the conflict has served to invalidate widespread early prognostications that Ukraine would quickly fall; a reversal of fortunes is impossible to discount. It nevertheless appears that Russia is headed for defeat. Less certain is what form this defeat will take. Three basic scenarios exist, and each one would have different ramifications for policymakers in the West and Ukraine.\n\nThe first and least likely scenario is that Russia will agree to its defeat by accepting a negotiated settlement on Ukraines terms. A great deal would have to change for this scenario to materialize because any semblance of diplomatic dialogue among Russia, Ukraine, and the West has vanished. The scope of Russian aggression and the extent of Russian war crimes would make it difficult for Ukraine to accept any diplomatic settlement that amounted to anything less than a total Russian surrender.\n\nThat said, a Russian governmentunder Putin or a successorcould try to retain Crimea and sue for peace elsewhere. To save face domestically, the Kremlin could claim it is preparing for the long game in Ukraine, leaving open the possibility of additional military incursions. It could blame its underperformance on NATO, arguing that the alliances weapon deliveries, not Ukraines strength, impeded a Russian victory. For this approach to pass muster within the regime, hard-linerspossibly including Putin himselfwould have to be marginalized. This would be difficult but not impossible. Still, under Putin this outcome is highly improbable, given that his approach to the war has been maximalist from the beginning.\n\nA second scenario for Russian defeat would involve failure amid escalation. The Kremlin would nihilistically seek to prolong the war in Ukraine while launching a campaign of unacknowledged acts of sabotage in countries that support Kyiv and in Ukraine itself. In the worst case, Russia could opt for a nuclear attack on Ukraine. The war would then edge toward a direct military confrontation between NATO and Russia. Russia would transform from a revisionist state into a rogue one, a transition that is already underway, and that would harden the Wests conviction that Russia poses a unique and unacceptable threat. Crossing the nuclear threshold could lead to NATOs conventional involvement in the war, accelerating Russias defeat on the ground.\n\nA destroyed Russian howitzer in Kharkiv region, Ukraine September 2022 Ukrainian Armed Forces / Reuters\n\nThe final scenario for the wars end would be defeat through regime collapse, with the decisive battles taking place not in Ukraine but rather in the halls of the Kremlin or in the streets of Moscow. Putin has concentrated power rigidly in his own hands, and his obstinacy in pursuing a losing war has placed his regime on shaky ground. Russians will continue marching behind their inept tsar only to a certain point. Although Putin has brought political stability to Russiaa prized state of affairs given the ruptures of the post-Soviet yearshis citizens could turn on him if the war leads to general privation. The collapse of his regime could mean an immediate end to the war, which Russia would be unable to wage amid the ensuing domestic chaos. A coup dtat followed by civil war would echo what happened after the Bolshevik takeover in 1917, which precipitated Russias withdrawal from World War I.\n\nNo matter how it comes about, a Russian defeat would of course be welcomed. It would free Ukraine from the terrors it has suffered since the invasion. It would reinforce the principle that an attack on another country cannot go unpunished. It might open up new opportunities for Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova, and for the West to finish ordering Europe in its image. For Belarus, a path could emerge toward the end of dictatorship and toward free and fair elections. Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine could strive together for eventual integration into the European Union and possibly NATO, following the model of Central and Eastern European governments after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThough Russias defeat would have many benefits, the United States and Europe should prepare for the regional and global disorder it would produce. Since 2008, Russia has been a revisionist power. It has redrawn borders, annexed territory, meddled in elections, inserted itself into various African conflicts, and altered the geopolitical dynamic of the Middle East by propping up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Were Russia to pursue radical escalation or splinter into chaos instead of accepting a defeat through negotiation, the repercussions would be felt in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Disorder could take the form of separatism and renewed conflicts in and around Russia, the worlds largest country in landmass. The transformation of Russia into a failed state riven by civil war would revive questions that Western policymakers had to grapple with in 1991: for example, who would gain control of Russias nuclear weapons? A disorderly Russian defeat would leave a dangerous hole in the international system.\n\nCant Talk Your Way Out\n\nTrying to sell Putin on defeat through negotiation would be difficult, perhaps impossible. (It would be much likelier under a successor.) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would demand that Moscow abandon its claim on the nominally Russian-controlled territories in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. Putin has already celebrated the annexation of these areas with pomp and circumstance. It is doubtful he would do an about-face after this patriotic display despite Russias tenuous hold on this territory. Any Russian leader, whether Putin or someone else, would resist relinquishing Crimea, the part of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nConditions on the ground in Russia would have to be conducive to compromise. A new Russian leadership would have to contend with a demoralized military and gamble on a complacent public acceding to capitulation. Russians could eventually become indifferent if the war grinds on with no clear resolution. But fighting would likely continue in parts of eastern Ukraine, and tensions between the two countries would remain high.\n\nStill, an agreement with Ukraine could bring normalization of relations with the West. That would be a powerful incentive for a less militaristic Russian leader than Putin, and it would appeal to many Russians. Western leaders could also be enticed to push for negotiations in the interest of ending the war. The hitch here is timing. In the first two months after the February 2022 invasion, Russia had the chance to negotiate with Zelensky and capitalize on its battlefield leverage. After Ukraines successful counteroffensives, however, Kyiv has little reason to concede anything at all. Since invading, Russia has upped the ante and escalated hostilities instead of showing a willingness to compromise. A less intransigent leader than Putin might lead Ukraine to consider negotiating. In the face of defeat, Putin could resort to lashing out on the global stage. He has steadily expanded his framing of the war, claiming that the West is waging a proxy battle against Russia with the goal of destroying the country. His 2022 speeches were more megalomaniacal versions of his address at the Munich Security Conference 15 years earlier, in which he denounced American exceptionalism, arguing that the United States \"has overstepped its national borders in every way.\"\n\nPart bluster, part nonsense, part trial balloon, Putins rhetoric is meant to mobilize Russians emotionally. But there is also a tactical logic behind it: although expanding the war beyond Ukraine will obviously not win Putin the territory he craves, it could prevent Ukraine and the West from winning the conflict. His bellicose language is laying the groundwork for escalation and a twenty-first-century confrontation with the West in which Russia would seek to exploit its asymmetric advantages as a rogue or terrorist state.\n\nThe consequences of a Russian nuclear attack would be catastrophic, and not just for Ukraine.\n\nRussias tools for confrontation could include the use of chemical or biological weapons in or outside Ukraine. Putin could destroy energy pipelines or seabed infrastructure or mount cyberattacks on the Wests financial institutions. The use of tactical nuclear weapons could be his last resort. In a speech on September 30, Putin brought up Hiroshima and Nagasaki, offering jumbled interpretations of World War IIs end phase. The analogy is imperfect, to put it mildly. If Russia were to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, Kyiv would not surrender. For one thing, Ukrainians know that Russian occupation would equal the extinction of their country, which was not the case for Japan in 1945. In addition, Japan was losing the war at the time. As of late 2022, it was Russia, the nuclear power, that was losing.\n\nThe consequences of a nuclear attack would be catastrophic, and not just for the Ukrainian population. Yet war would go on, and nuclear weapons would not do much to assist Russian soldiers on the ground. Instead, Russia would face international outrage. For now, Brazil, China, and India have not condemned Russias invasion, but no country is truly supporting Moscow in its horrific war, and none would support the use of nuclear weapons. Chinese President Xi Jinping made this publicly explicit in November: after he met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, he issued a statement declaring that the leaders \"jointly oppose the use or threat of the use of nuclear weapons.\" If Putin did defy this warning, he would be an isolated pariah, punished economically and perhaps militarily by a global coalition.\n\nFor Russia, then, threatening to use nuclear weapons is of greater utility than actually doing so. But Putin may still go down this path: after all, launching the invasion was a spectacularly ill-conceived move, and yet he did it. If he does opt for breaking the nuclear taboo, NATO is unlikely to respond in kind, so as to avoid risking an apocalyptic nuclear exchange. The alliance, however, would in all likelihood respond with conventional force to weaken Russias military and to prevent further nuclear attacks, risking an escalatory spiral should Russia launch conventional attacks on NATO in return.\n\nEven if this scenario could be avoided, a Russian defeat after nuclear use would still have dangerous repercussions. It would create a world without the imperfect nuclear equilibrium of the Cold War and the 30-year postCold War era. It would encourage leaders around the globe to go nuclear because it would appear that their safety could only be assured by acquiring nuclear weapons and showing a willingness to use them. A helter-skelter age of proliferation would ensue, to the immense detriment of global security.\n\nHeavy is the Head\n\nAt this point, the Russian public has not risen up to oppose the war. Russians may be skeptical of Putin and may not trust his government. But they also do not want their sons, fathers, and brothers in uniform to lose on the battlefield. Accustomed to Russias great-power status through the centuries and isolated from the West, most Russians would not want their country to be without any power and influence in Europe. That would be a natural consequence of a Russian defeat in Ukraine.\n\nStill, a long war would commit Russians to a bleak future and would probably spark a revolutionary flame in the country. Russian casualties have been high, and as the Ukrainian military grows in strength, it can inflict still greater losses. The exodus of hundreds of thousands of young Russians, many of them highly skilled, has been astonishing. Over time, the combination of war, sanctions, and brain drain will take a massive tolland Russians may eventually blame Putin, who began his presidential career as a self-proclaimed modernizer. Most Russians were insulated from his previous wars because they generally occurred far from the home front and didnt require a mass mobilization to replenish troops. Thats not the case with the war in Ukraine.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier writing on a Howitzer shell in Donetsk region, Ukraine November 2022 Serhii Nuzhnenko / Radio Free Europe / Reuters\n\nRussia has a history of regime change in the aftermath of unsuccessful wars. The Russo-Japanese War of 19045 and World War I helped lead to the Bolshevik Revolution. The collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, came two years after the end of the Soviet militarys misadventure in Afghanistan. Revolutions have occurred in Russia when the government has failed in its economic and political objectives and has been unresponsive to crises. Generally, the coup de grce has been the puncturing of the governments underlying ideology, such as the loss of legitimacy of Russias monarchy and tsardom in the midst of hunger, poverty, and a faltering war effort in 1917.\n\nPutin is at risk in all these categories. His management of the war has been awful, and the Russian economy is contracting. In the face of these dismal trends, Putin has doubled down on his errors, all the while insisting that the war is going \"according to plan.\" Repression can solve some of his problems: the arrest and prosecution of dissidents can quell protest at first. But Putins heavy hand also runs the risk of spurring more dissatisfaction.\n\nIf Putin were deposed, it is unclear who would succeed him. For the first time since coming to power in 1999, Putins \"power vertical\"a highly centralized government hierarchy based on loyalty to the Russian presidenthas been losing a degree of its verticality. Two possible contenders outside the traditional elite structures are Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group, a private military contractor that has furnished mercenaries for the war on Ukraine, and Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic. They might be tempted to chip away at the remains of Putins power vertical, encouraging infighting in the regime in hopes of securing a position in the center of Russias new power structure after Putins departure. They could also try to claim power themselves. They have already put pressure on the leadership of the Russian army and the Defense Ministry in response to failures in the war and attempted to broaden their own power bases with the backing of loyal paramilitary forces. Other contenders could come from traditional elite circles, such as the presidential administration, the cabinet, or military and security forces. To suppress palace intrigue, Putin has surrounded himself with mediocrities for the past 20 years. But his unsuccessful war threatens his hold on power. If he truly believes his recent speeches, he may have convinced his subordinates that he is living in a fantasy world.\n\nDestruction in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine, December 2022 Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy / Reuters\n\nThe chances that a pro-Western democrat would become Russias next president are vanishingly small. Far more likely is an authoritarian leader in the Putinist mold. A leader from outside the power vertical could end the war and contemplate better relations with the West. But a leader who comes from within Putins Kremlin would not have this option because he would be trailed by a public record of supporting the war. The challenge of being a Putinist after Putin would be formidable.\n\nOne challenge would be the war, which would be no easier to manage for a successor, especially one who shared Putins dream of restoring Russias great-power status. Another challenge would be building legitimacy in a political system without any of its traditional sources. Russia has no constitution to speak of and no monarchy. Anyone who followed Putin would lack popular support and find it difficult to personify the neo-Soviet, neoimperial ideology that Putin has come to embody.\n\nIn the worst case, Putins fall could translate into civil war and Russias disintegration. Power would be contested at the top, and state control would fragment throughout the country. This period could be an echo of the Time of Troubles, or smuta, a 15-year crisis of succession in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries marked by rebellion, lawlessness, and foreign invasion. Russians regard that era as a period of humiliation to be avoided at all costs. Russias twenty-first-century troubles could see the emergence of warlords from the security services and violent separatists in the countrys economically distressed regions, many of which are home to large numbers of ethnic minorities. Although a Russia in turmoil might not formally end the war in Ukraine, it might simply be unable to conduct it, in which case Ukraine would have regained its peace and independence while Russia descended into anarchy.\n\nAgent of Chaos\n\nPutins invasion of Ukraine as a first step in refashioning a Russian empire has had the opposite effect. The war has diminished his ability to strong-arm Russias neighbors. When Azerbaijan fought a border skirmish with Armenia last year, Russia refused to intervene on Armenias behalf, even though it is Armenias formal ally.\n\nA similar dynamic is at play in Kazakhstan. Had Kyiv capitulated, Putin might have decided to invade Kazakhstan next: the former Soviet republic has a large ethnic Russian population, and Putin has no respect for international borders. A different possibility now looms: if the Kremlin were to undergo regime change, it might free Kazakhstan from Russias grasp entirely, allowing the country to serve as a safe haven for Russians in exile. That would be far from the only change in the region. In the South Caucasus and in Moldova, old conflicts could revive and intensify. Ankara could continue to support its partner Azerbaijan against Armenia. Were Turkey to lose its fear of Russian opprobrium, it might urge Azerbaijan to press forward with further attacks on Armenia. In Syria, Turkey would have reason to step up its military presence if Russia were to fall back.\n\nIf Russia descended into chaos, Georgia could operate with greater latitude. The shadow of Russias military force, which has loomed over the country since the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, would be removed. Georgia could continue its quest to eventually become a member of the European Union, although it was bypassed as a candidate last year because of inner turmoil and a lack of domestic reforms. If the Russian military were to withdraw from the region, conflicts might again break out between Georgia and South Ossetia on the one hand and between Georgia and Abkhazia on the other. That dynamic could also emerge in Moldova and its breakaway region Transnistria, where Russian soldiers have been stationed since 1992. Moldovas candidacy for European Union membership, announced in June 2022, might be its escape from this long-standing conflict. The European Union would surely be willing to help Moldova with conflict resolution.\n\nPutins fall could translate into civil war and Russias disintegration.\n\nLeadership changes in Russia would shake Belarus, where the dictator Alexander Lukashenko is propped up by Russian money and military might. Were Putin to fall, Lukashenko would in all likelihood be next. A Belarusian government in exile already exists: Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who lives in Lithuania, became the countrys opposition leader in 2020 after her husband was jailed for trying to run against Lukashenko. Free and fair elections could be held, allowing the country to rescue itself from dictatorship, if it managed to insulate itself from Russia. If Belarus could not secure its independence, Russias potential internal strife could spill over there, which would in turn affect neighbors such as Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine.\n\nIf Russia were to truly disintegrate and lose its influence in Eurasia, other actors, such as China, would move in. Before the war, China mostly exerted economic rather than military influence in the region. That is changing. China is on the advance in Central Asia. The South Caucasus and the Middle East could be its next areas of encroachment.\n\nA defeated and internally destabilized Russia would demand a new paradigm of global order. The reigning liberal international order revolves around the legal management of power. It emphasizes rules and multilateral institutions. The great-power-competition model, a favorite of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was about the balance of power, tacitly or explicitly viewing spheres of influence as the source of international order. If Russia were to suffer a defeat in Ukraine, policymakers would have to take into account the presence and the absence of power, in particular the absence or severe decline of Russian power. A diminished Russia would have an impact on conflicts around the globe, including those in Africa and the Middle East, not to mention in Europe. Yet a reduced or broken Russia would not necessarily usher in a golden age of order and stability.\n\nA defeated Russia would mark a change from the past two decades, when the country was an ascendant power. Throughout the 1990s and into the first decade of this century, Russia haphazardly aspired to integrate into Europe and partner with the United States. Russia joined the G-8 and the World Trade Organization. It assisted with U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan. In the four years when Dmitry Medvedev was Russias president, from 2008 to 2012, Russia appeared to be playing along with the rules-based international order, if one did not look too closely behind the curtain.\n\nA Russia amenable to peaceful coexistence with the West may have been an illusion from the beginning. Putin projected a conciliatory air early in his presidency, although he may have harbored hatred of the West, contempt for the rules-based order, and an eagerness to dominate Ukraine all along. In any case, once he retook the presidency in 2012, Russia dropped out of the rules-based order. Putin derided the system as nothing more than camouflage for a domineering United States. Russia violently encroached on Ukraines sovereignty by annexing Crimea, reinserted itself in the Middle East by supporting Assad in Syrias civil war, and erected networks of Russian military and security influence in Africa. An assertive Russia and an ascendant China contributed to a paradigm of great-power competition in Beijing, Moscow, and even a post-Trump Washington.\n\nIf Russia were to disintegrate and lose its influence in Eurasia, China would move in.\n\nDespite its acts of aggression and its substantial nuclear arsenal, Russia is in no way a peer competitor of China or the United States. Putins overreach in Ukraine suggests that he has not grasped this important point. But because Putin has intervened in regions around the world, a defeat in Ukraine that tore apart Russia would be a resounding shock to the international system.\n\nThe defeat could, to be sure, have positive consequences for many countries in Russias neighborhood. Look no further than the end of the Cold War, when the demise of the Soviet Union allowed for the emergence of more than a dozen free and prosperous countries in Europe. A Russia turned inward might help foster a \"Europe whole and free,\" to borrow the phrase used by U.S. President George H. W. Bush to describe American ambitions for the continent after the Cold War ended. At the same time, disarray in Russia could create a vortex of instability: less great-power competition than great-power anarchy, leading to a cascade of regional wars, migrant flows, and economic uncertainty.\n\nRussias collapse could also be contagious or the start of a chain reaction, in which case neither the United States nor China would profit because both would struggle to contain the fallout. In that case, the West would need to establish strategic priorities. It would be impossible to try to fill the vacuum that a disorderly Russian defeat might leave. In Central Asia and the South Caucasus, the United States and Europe would have little chance of preventing China and Turkey from moving into the void. Instead of attempting to shut them out, a more realistic U.S. strategy would be to attempt to restrain their influence and offer an alternative, especially to Chinas dominance.\n\nWhatever form Russias defeat took, stabilizing eastern and southeastern Europe, including the Balkans, would be a herculean task. Across Europe, the West would have to find a creative answer to the questions that were never resolved after 1991: Is Russia a part of Europe? If not, how high should the wall between Russia and Europe be, and around which countries should it run? If Russia is a part of Europe, where and how does it fit in? Where does Europe itself start and end? The incorporation of Finland and Sweden into NATO would be only the beginning of this project. Belarus and Ukraine demonstrate the difficulties of protecting Europes eastern flank: those countries are the last place where Russia would give up on its great-power aspirations. And even a ruined Russia would not lose all its nuclear and conventional military capacity.\n\nTwice in the last 106 yearsin 1917 and in 1991versions of Russia have broken apart. Twice, versions of Russia have reconstituted themselves. If Russian power recedes, the West should capitalize on that opportunity to shape an environment in Europe that serves to protect NATO members, allies, and partners. A Russian defeat would furnish many opportunities and many temptations. One of these temptations would be to expect that a defeated Russia would essentially disappear from Europe. But a defeated Russia will one day reassert itself and pursue its interests on its terms. The West should be politically and intellectually equipped both for Russias defeat and for Russias return.",

                "cc_text": "In an essay for the Atlantic Council published in December 2021, I stated that Europes future would be decided in Ukraine. One year on, what may earlier have seemed like a bold statement is now recognizable fact. Ukraine has become Europes shield, defending the continent along a 2,500-kilometer front line.\n\nWith each new success of the Ukrainian army, the threats facing NATO and the European Union diminish. Over the past ten months, Ukraine has destroyed a large number of Russian army units that have been training for decades to attack the West. Russias military potential will take years to recover. Ukraines heroism has won Europe precious time to rethink its approach to security and defense.\n\nThis reevaluation should begin with a frank reflection on the events of the past twelve months. Every single prewar Ukrainian warning regarding the likely consequences of a full-scale Russian invasion has come to pass, from millions of refugees to global energy and food crises. One year ago, Germanys leaders were still insisting the Nord Stream II pipeline was a purely economic project. It is now painfully obvious that there can be no return to this kind of \"business as usual\" with Putins Russia.\n\nSince the Russian invasion began on February 24, the international community has taken a number of appropriate steps to sanction Russia and has provided Ukraine with vital support that has changed the course of the war. Nevertheless, the fact remains that we requested most of these steps prior to the invasion, only to be told that it was impossible. This caution has proven extremely costly.\n\nNor is the danger limited to Russia itself. In recent months, Moscow has sought to form criminal coalitions with other terrorist regimes. Russia and Iran are now testing cheap but deadly drone technologies against Ukrainian civilian targets. It will come as no surprise if these weapons are soon deployed elsewhere. Russian military technologies offered to Iran in exchange for their support in Ukraine pose a further threat to international stability.\n\nBoth Russia and Iran have previously been offered ample opportunities to pursue policies of global integration on very generous terms. Instead, they have consciously chosen confrontation and have sought to weaponize everything from energy and food supplies to migrants and social media. This proves the folly of earlier efforts to appease Vladimir Putin and gives a strong indication of what we can expect if Western leaders do not adopt a more resolute stance. Todays already alarming security situation will only deteriorate if Russia is not decisively defeated in 2023.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nThe world has already paid a terrible price for handing Russia the geopolitical initiative. For Ukraine, this has included tens of thousands of lives and destruction on a scale not witnessed in Europe since World War II. For the wider international community, the economic costs can already be counted in the trillions of dollars. Clearly, it is time to try a different formula.\n\nThe first step toward addressing the current security crisis is regaining the initiative. This means adopting tough preventative measures rather than simply reacting to Russia. It is vital to acknowledge the new security realities created by Russian aggression and reject attempts to resurrect the failed and discredited policies of the past. There can be no way back to the prewar status quo. Most important of all, Western leaders must unambiguously identify Russias defeat as an attainable and desirable goal.\n\nThe coming year will present the West with the perfect opportunity to get it right. We expect to face many of the same security challenges encountered in 2022, including the possibility of major new Russian offensives against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. When Putins invasion began on February 24, the world was initially stunned. This time, there can be no such excuses.\n\nRussia is currently seeking to buy time in order to rearm. It is bombing Ukraines energy infrastructure and creating a humanitarian catastrophe to force Ukraine back to the negotiating table. In parallel, all manner of voices are calling for a return to diplomacy and advocating a Kremlin-friendly compromise peace that would merely set the stage for more war. This is the most immediate challenge facing the international community. Ukraines partners must reject such calls and underline that peace is impossible without Russias defeat.\n\nInstead of seeking face-saving off-ramps for Putin, Western policymakers should now be looking to capitalize on Russias weakness. This means supplying Ukraine with the air defenses, long-range missiles, tanks, and planes we need in order to end the war.\n\nFailure to do so will not prevent escalations, as some critics claim. On the contrary, hesitation on the part of Ukraines international partners only encourages the Kremlin to continue its aggression. Does anybody still seriously believe that not giving Ukraine Western fighter jets will make the world safe from Russias next invasion? Will the absence of adequate air defense systems prevent the Kremlin from acquiring Iranian ballistic missiles? It is time to abandon such illusions.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine proved that it was more than capable of using Western arms supplies to great effect. With Russia now attempting to regroup and preparing a new wave of attacks, it makes no sense to delay weapons deliveries based on misplaced fears of escalation. This will only lead to more casualties and increase the price of Russias eventual defeat. Instead, the West must learn the lessons of the past year and act decisively.\n\nTime and again, Ukraines battlefield successes have confirmed that the only negotiating language Russia recognizes is the language of strength. Ukraine has forced Putins army to retreat from the entire north of the country and has routed Russian troops in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. The sinking of the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship and the destruction of strategic bombers at bases deep inside Russia have proved far more effective at grabbing Russias attention that any diplomatic gestures.\n\nIf Ukraine does not receive the necessary support in 2023, todays mounting security challenges will multiply exponentially around the world. A wide range of authoritarian regimes are closely monitoring developments in Ukraine and will regard any Russian success as a green light for their own acts of aggression. There is also a danger that other regions of the world will prove less able to defend themselves than Ukraine.\n\nThis gloomy scenario is both predictable and entirely avoidable. If the international community provides sufficient military supplies, there is every reason to believe Ukraine will finish the job of defeating Russia in 2023. This would send a resounding message to any dictators and world-be conquerors that force is not a viable foreign policy tool.\n\nA Ukrainian victory would bring with it the prospect of a sustainable peace and the opportunity to build on the countrys vast potential. The consequences would also be felt far beyond Ukraines borders, with the security situation likely to improve dramatically in the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and as far away as Central Asia and Africa. On a global scale, Ukraines success would reinvigorate the entire democratic world while demonstrating the renewed strength of the rules-based international order.\n\nThe world enters 2023 at a crossroads. Russia seeks to dismantle the progress of recent decades and drag us all back to an era of imperial aggression, but the Kremlin must first overcome Ukrainian resistance. If Russia is decisively defeated in Ukraine, the path will be open to a safer and more prosperous planet. Securing this defeat must be the international communitys top priority in 2023.\n\nOleksii Reznikov is Ukraines Minister of Defense.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

DW has the latest.\n\nThe Ukrainian capital Kyiv was targeted once again by so-called kamikaze drone on Monday. An alert was first declared in the middle of the night.\n\n\"The enemy is attacking the capital with 'Shahed' barrage ammunition,\" the Kyiv military administration wrote on Telegram. \"The air defense is working.\"\n\nKyiv officials said 18 out of 23 drones were shot down over the city of 3.6 million. A witness in the city told Reuters that they had heard loud blasts during the early hours, but it was not clear if this came from strikes landing or from air defenses downing the drones.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia unleashed 35 drones on Ukraine in the early hours of Monday as many people slept, hitting critical infrastructure in and around Kyiv in Moscow's third air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days.\n\nThe Ukrainian military also said that air defenses shot down 30 incoming drones.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's atomic agency Energoatom said that a Russian \"kamikaze\" drone had flown over a part of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant just after midnight.\n\n\"This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of nuclear and radiation safety,\" Energoatom said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nHere are the other main headlines from the war in Ukraine on Sunday December 19.\n\nPutin: 'fruitful' talks with Lukashenko\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin described talks with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko as \"very fruitful,\" according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nRussia's president said that he believes both Moscow and Minsk are succeeding at withstanding the pressure of Western sanctions.\n\n\"We are coordinating our steps to minimize the influence of the illegal restriction measures on our economy,\" Putin said. \"And we are doing it quite convincingly and effectively.\"\n\nPutin said that there had been price agreements in the energy sector, without providing further details.\n\nHe added that Russia will train Belarusian crews for possible missions with nuclear weapons.\n\nLukashenko urges unity with Moscow in 'difficult times'\n\nBelarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko urged closer military cooperation with Russia during a rare visit from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPutin landed in Minsk with his defense and foreign minister in tow, hours after Russian forces launched a swarm of attack drones at critical infrastructure in Kyiv, which provoked emergency blackouts in a dozen regions.\n\n\"Difficult times require us to have political will and to focus on getting results on all topics of the bilateral agenda,\" Lukashenko told Putin.\n\n\"The main issues lately have been defense and security issues,\" he added.\n\nPutin told his Belarusian ally that he hoped to deepen economic ties between the countries during the visit and praised Belarus as \"our ally in the truest sense of the word.\"\n\nBelarus has been taken 'hostage' by Russia To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nCanada to seize assets of sanctioned Russian oligarch Abramovich\n\nThe Canadian government said it will start the process to seize and pursue the forfeiture of $26 million from Granite Capital Holdings Ltd, a company owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.\n\nRussian oligarchs are complicit in the \"illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine\" and Canada \"will not be a haven for their ill-gotten gains,\" Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.\n\nAbramovich is a Russian oligarch and politician sanctioned by the UK, EU, Canada, Australia and Switzerland. He owns stakes in Russian steel giant Evraz and nickel producer Norilsk Nickel. He is also the former owner of Chelsea, a Premier League football club. After his British investor visa expired in 2018, he became an Israeli citizen and, in 2021, a Portuguese citizen.\n\nZelenskyy asks Western leaders for wide range of weapons systems\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Western leaders meeting in Latvia, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, to supply a wide range of weapons systems.\n\n\"I ask you to increase the possibility of supplying air defense systems to our country, and to help speed up the relevant decisions to be taken by our partners,\" Zelenskyy asked Sunak during his speech on a video link, addressing a meeting in Riga of leaders of countries in the Joint Expeditionary Force.\n\nThe British-led grouping, configured to respond rapidly to crises in northern Europe, is made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.\n\n\"For our defense operations to be more successful we need armoured vehicles, primarily tanks,\" said Zelenskyy. He asked Norway to supply more of Norway-made NASAMS launchers and missiles and Sweden for Swedish-produced Gripen fighter aircraft, RBS 98 missiles and Archer artillery.\n\nZelenskyy also asked Denmark to transfer Ceasar howizers to Ukraine, Finland for more ammunition shells, Lithuania for NASAMS as well as Stinger missiles, Latvia for artillery, and Estonia for howitzers and ammunition.\n\nWhile Western allies, led by the United States, have been supporting Ukraine with funding, military training and deliveries of air defense systems and other weaponry, Kyiv has said still more was needed to sustain its campaign against Russia.\n\nAustria accuses Greek national of spying for Russia\n\nA 39-year-old Greek national of Russian descent has been accused by Austrian investigators of spying for the Russian military intelligence agency GRU.\n\nThe man, who allegedly received special military training in Russia, passed information gathered in Austria about the war in Ukraine to various diplomats and intelligence services, the Austrian Interior Ministry said.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the man is the son of a former Russian spy who was once stationed as a diplomat in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe suspect had been in Moscow shortly before and during the start of the military invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces in late February.\n\nAuthorities found the man's frequent travel to be suspicious. From 2018 to the start of 2022, he had made a total of 65 trips to countries in Europe, including Russia, Belarus, Turkey and Georgia.\n\nHe had also acquired several properties in Vienna, in Russia and in Greece, although officially he had only a small income, the ministry said.\n\nWagner group sees convicts as expendable UK Defense Ministry\n\nRussian military proxy group Wagner continues to take a major role in attritional combat around Bakhmut in Donetsk region, the UK Defense Ministry wrote in its latest intelligence update.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the group developed offensive tactics to make use of the large number of poorly trained convicts it has recruited.\n\n\"Individual fighters are likely issued a smart phone or tablet which shows the individuals designated axis of advance and assault objective superimposed on commercial satellite imagery. At platoon level and above, commanders likely remain in cover and give orders over radios, informed by video feeds from small uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs),\" the ministry wrote in the update.\n\nWagner operatives who deviate from their assault routes without authorization are likely being threatened with summary execution.\n\nAccording to the update, these brutal tactics aim to conserve Wagner's rare assets of experienced commanders and armored vehicles, at the expense of the more readily available convict-recruits, which the organization assesses as expendable.\n\nUK PM to announce further arms deliveries to Ukraine\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to announce a new package of \"hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition,\" according to a statement released ahead of a meeting later on Monday.\n\nSunak will take part in a meeting with his Baltic, Nordic and Dutch counterparts in Riga.\n\nLondon aims to keep up its delivery of ammunition with a 250 million ($304 million, 287 million) contract \"that will ensure a constant flow of critical artillery ammunition to Ukraine throughout 2023.\"\n\nThe statement from the prime minister's office also said that Sunak will call on the UK's allies to maintain or surpass the level of military aid to Ukraine next year.\n\nPutin to visit key ally Lukashenko in Belarus\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is set to make his first visit to Belarus since 2019 on Monday.\n\nHe will meet with his close ally, strongman Alexander Lukashenko. They are set to discuss their strategic partnership as well as regional and international issues.\n\nLukashenko, who held onto power following what is widely seen as a fraudulent election in 2020, is reliant on financial support from Putin.\n\nBelarus in return allowed Russian troops to use its land as a launch pad during its initial invasion of Ukraine in February, although the former Soviet state has not joined the conflict.\n\nHours before Putin's visit to Minsk, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian troops will conduct military exercises in Belarus.\n\n\"The final assessment of the combat capability and combat readiness of the units will be given... after the battalion tactical exercises have been conducted,\" Interfax quoted the Russian Defense Ministry as saying. It did not mention when and where the drills would take place.\n\nInterfax also reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry, that Russia and China will hold joint naval exercises between December 21 and 27. The exercises will include missile and artillery firing in the East China Sea, the ministry said.\n\ndh,ab/ar,fb (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

                "cc_text": "Russia seeks arms control agreements to prevent dangerous escalation. But the U.S. seeks only unilateral advantage. This risks all out conflict unless this changes.\n\nBy Scott Ritter\n\nSpecial to Consortium News\n\nDec. 8 marked the 35th anniversary of the signing of the intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty. This landmark arms control event was the byproduct of years of hard-nose negotiations capped off by the political courage of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev who together signed the treaty and oversaw its ratification by their respective legislatures.\n\nThe first inspectors went to work on July 1, 1988. I was fortunate to count myself among them.\n\nIn August 2019, former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the INF treaty; Russia followed shortly thereafter, and this foundational arms control agreement was no more.\n\nThe Decline of Arms Control\n\nThe termination of the INF treaty is part and parcel of an overall trend which has seen arms control as an institution and a concept decline in the eyes of policy makers in both Washington and Moscow. This point was driven home during a two-day period where I marked the INF anniversary with veteran arms control professionals from both the U.S. and Russia.\n\nThese experts, drawn from the ranks of the diplomatic corps who negotiated the treaty, the military and civilian personnel who implemented the treaty others from all walks of life who were affiliated with the treaty in one shape or another, all had something to say about the current state of U.S.-Russian arms control.\n\n[Related: Sometimes Humanity Gets it Right, Scott Ritter, Consortium News.]\n\nOne thing that struck me was the importance of language in defining arms control expectations amongst the different players. Words have meaning, and one of the critical aspects of any arms control negotiation is to ensure that the treaty text means the same thing in both languages.\n\nWhen the INF treaty was negotiated, U.S. and Soviet negotiators had the benefit of decades of negotiating history regarding the anti-ballistic missiles (ABM) treaty, the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT), and START, from which a common lexicon of agreed-upon arms control terminology was created.\n\nOver the years, this lexicon helped streamline both the negotiation and implementation of various arms control agreements, ensuring that everyone was on the same page when it came to defining what had been committed to.\n\nToday, however, after having listened to these veteran arms control professionals, it was clear to me that a common lexicon of arms control terminology no longer existed words that once had a shared definition now meant different things to different people, and this definition gap could and indeed would further devolve as each side pursued their respective vision of arms control devoid of any meaningful contact with the other.\n\nThe U.S. Lexicon\n\nDisarmament . Apparently, disarmament doesnt mean what it once did to the U.S.the actual verifiable elimination of designated weapons and capability. In fact, disarmament and its corollary, reduction, are no longer in vogue amongst the U.S. arms control community. Instead, there is an arms control process designed to promote the national security interest. And by arms control, we mean arms increase.\n\nAmerica, it seems, is no longer in the arms reduction business. We did away with the ABM and INF treaties, and as a result we are deploying a new generation of ballistic missile defense systems and intermediate-range weapons. While this is disconcerting enough, the real threat comes if and when the only remaining arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia the New START treaty expires in February 2026.\n\nIf there is not a replacement treaty of similar capacity negotiated, ratified and ready for implementation at that time, then the notion of strategic arms control will be completely untethered from any controlling mechanism. The U.S. would then be free to modernize and expand its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal. Disarmament, it seems, means the exact opposite rearmament. George Orwell would be proud.\n\nThe Interagency . Back when the INF treaty was negotiated and implemented, the United States was graced with a single point of contact for arms control matters t he Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, or ACDA. Formed by President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s, ACDA provided the foundation for continuity and consistency for U.S. arms control policy, even as the White House changed hands.\n\nWhile there were numerous bureaucratic stakeholders involved in formulating and executing U.S. arms control policy, ACDA helped ride herd over their often-competing visions through what was known as the interagency processa system of coordinating groups and committees that brought the various players around one table to hammer out a unified vision for disarmament and arms control. The interagency was, however, a process, not a standalone entity.\n\nHow times have changed. Today, ACDA is gone. In its place is what is referred to as The Interagency. More than a simple process, The Interagency has morphed into a standalone policy making entity that is more than simply the combined power of its constituent components, but rather a looming reality that dominates arms control policy decision making.\n\nThe Interagency has moved away from being a process designed to streamline policy making, and instead transformed into a singular entity whose mission is to resist change and preserve existing power structures.\n\nWhereas previously the various departments and agencies that make up the U.S. national security enterprise could shape and mold the interagency process in a manner which facilitated policy formulation and implementation, today The Interagency serves as a permanent brake on progress, a mechanism where new policy initiatives disappear into, never to be seen again.\n\nSole Purpose . Sole Purpose is a doctrinal concept which holds that the sole purpose of Americas nuclear arsenal is deterrence, and that American nuclear weapons exist only to respond to any nuclear attack against the United States in such a manner that the effective elimination of the nation or nations that attacked the U.S. would be guaranteed.\n\nSole Purpose was linked to the notion of mutually assured destruction, or MAD. Sole purpose/MAD was the cornerstone philosophy behind successive American presidential administrations. In 2002, however, the administration of President George W. Bush did away with the Sole Purpose doctrine, and instead adopted a nuclear posture which held that the U.S. could use nuclear weapons preemptively, even in certain non-nuclear scenarios.\n\nBarack Obama, upon winning the presidency, promised to do away with the Bush-era policy of preemption but, when his eight-year tenure as the American commander in chief was complete, the policy of nuclear preemption remained in place. Obamas successor, Donald Trump, not only retained the policy of nuclear preemption, but expanded it to create even more possibilities for the use of U.S. nuclear weapons.\n\nJoe Biden, the current occupant of the White House, campaigned on a promise to restore Sole Purpose to its original intent. However, upon assuming office, Bidens Sole Purpose policy ran headfirst into The Interagency which, according to someone in the know, was not ready for such a change.\n\nInstead, Sole Purpose has been re-purposed to the extent that it now reflects a policy posture of nuclear pre-emption. You got that rightthanks to The Interagency, the sole purpose of American nuclear weapons today is to be prepared to carry out preemptive attacks against looming or imminent threats. This, The Interagency believes, represents the best deterrent model available to promote the general welfare and greater good of the American people.\n\nThe Russian Lexicon\n\nReciprocity . Reciprocity is the Golden Rule of arms control do unto others as you would have others do unto you. It was the heart and sole on the INF treaty what was good for the Goose was always good for the Gander. In short, if the Americans mistreated the Soviet inspectors, one could guarantee that, in short order, American inspectors were certain to encounter precisely the same mistreatment.\n\nReciprocity was the concept which prevented the treaty from getting bogged down in petty matters and allowed the treaty to accomplish the enormous successes it enjoyed.\n\nUnder the terms of the New START treaty, each side is permitted to conduct up to 18 inspections per year. Before being halted in 2020 because of the pandemic, a total of 328 inspections had been carried out by both sides with the rules of reciprocity firmly in place and adhered to.\n\nHowever, in early 2021, when both sides agreed that inspections could resume, the U.S. demonstrated the reality that the concept of reciprocity was little more than a propaganda ploy to make Russia feel \"equal\" in the eyes of the treaty.\n\nWhen the Russians attempted to carry out an inspection in July, the aircraft carrying the inspection team was denied permission to fly through the airspace of European countries due to sanctions banning commercial flights to and from Russia in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russians cancelled the inspection.\n\nLater, in August, the U.S. tried to dispatch its own inspection team to Russia. The Russians, however, denied the team permission to enter, citing issues of reciprocity if Russian inspectors could not carry out their inspection tasks, then the U.S. would be similarly denied.\n\nFor Russia, the definition of reciprocity is quite clear equal treatment under the terms of a treaty. For the U.S., however, reciprocity is just another concept which it can use to shape and sustain the unilateral advantages it has accrued over the years when it came to implementing the New Start treaty.\n\nPredictability . Historically, the primary purpose of arms control agreements was to reach a common understanding of mutual objectives and the means to achieve them so that over the agreed upon timeframe there would exist an element of stability from the predictability of the agreement.\n\nThis, of course, required agreement on definitions and intent accompanied by a mutual understanding of the four corners of the deal, especially on quantifiable subjects such as treaty-limited items.\n\nUnder the INF treaty, the goals and objectives for both parties were absolute in nature: total elimination of the involved weapons which existed in a class covered by the treaty. One couldnt get much clearer than that and by mid-1991, all weapons covered by the treaty had been destroyed by both the U.S. and Soviet Union.\n\nSubsequent inspections were focused on ensuring both sides continued to comply with their obligation to permanently destroy the weapons systems designated for elimination and not to produce or deploy new weapons systems whose capabilities would be prohibited by the terms of the treaty.\n\nUnder New START, the goals and objectives are far more nebulous. Take, by way of example, the issue of decommissioning nuclear-capable bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missile launch tubes. The goal is to arrive at a hard number that meets the letter and intent of the treaty.\n\nBut the U.S. has undertaken to decommission both the B-52H and Trident missile launch tubes onboard Ohio-class submarines in a manner which allows for reversal, meaning that the hard caps envisioned by the treaty, and around which strategic planning and posture is derived, are not absolute, but flexible.\n\nAs such, Russian strategic planners must not only plan for a world where the treaty-imposed caps are in effect, but also the possibility of a U.S. \"break out\" scenario where the B-52H bombers and Trident missiles launch tubes are brought back to operational status.\n\nThis scenario is literally the textbook definition of unpredictability and is why Russia looks askance at the idea of negotiating a new arms control treaty with the U.S. As long as the U.S. favors treaty language which produces such unpredictability, Russia will more than likely opt out.\n\nAccountability . One of the most oft-quoted sayings that emerged from the INF treaty is \"trust but verify.\" This aphorism helped guide that treaty through the unprecedented success of its 13-year period of mandated inspections (from 1988 until 2001.) However, once the inspections ended, the \"verify\" aspect of the treaty became more nebulous in nature, opening the door for the erosion of trust between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nA key aspect of any arms control agreement is its continued relevance to the national security postures of the participating nations. At the same time the INF inspections came to an end, the administration of President George W. Bush withdrew from the landmark 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty.\n\nSupport CNs\n\nWinter Fund Drive!\n\nIn doing so, the United States propelled itself into a trajectory where the principles that had underpinned arms control for decadesthe de-escalation of nuclear tensions through the adherence to principles of disarmament set forth in mutually-reinforcing agreements intended to be of a lasting nature, no longer applied.\n\nBy unilaterally disposing of the ABM treaty, the U.S. opened the door for the deployment of ABM systems in Europe. Two Mk. 41 Aegis Ashore anti-missile defense systems, normally deployed as part of a ships Aegis-capable cruisers and destroyers, were instead installed on the ground in Romania and Poland. The issue of the Mk. 41 system is that the launch pods are capable of firing either the SM-3 missile as an interceptor, or the sea-launched cruise missile (Tomahawk.)\n\nRussia objected to the Mk. 41 potentially offense system being employed on the ground, arguing that in doing so the U.S. was violating the INF treat by deploying a ground-launched cruise missile.\n\nThe U.S. rejected the Russian allegations, declaring that the Aegis Ashore launch configuration was solely for the firing of surfacre-to-air missiles. However, the U.S. balked at providing Russia the kind of access that would be necessary to ascertain the actual science behind the U.S. claim that the missile batteries were configured to operate only in a surface-to-air mode.\n\nThe U.S. also claimed it was impossible for the Mk. 41 to incorporate the Tomahawk cruise missile or a follow-on variant of the SM-3 or the SM-6 Typhoon, which are surface-to-surface missiles at ranges (reaching Moscos) that would violate the INF treaty.\n\n(Removal of these missiles from Poland and Romania was one demand Russia made in draft treaty proposals to the U.S. last December. After the U.S. rejected it, Russia intervened in Ukraine.)\n\nAs had been the case with the ABM treaty, the U.S. had grown tired of the restrictions imposed by the INF treaty. U.S. military planners were anxious to field a new generation of INF weapons to counter what they perceived to be the growing threat from China, whose ballistic missile arsenals were not constrained by the treaty.\n\nThe ABM and INF treaties had become inconvenient to the U.S. not because of any actions undertaken by their treaty partners, the Russians, but rather due to an aggressive, expansive notion of U.S. power projection that mooted the purpose of the treaties altogether.\n\nArms control treaties are not meant to facilitate the expansion of military power, but rather restrict it. By viewing treaty obligations as disposable, the U.S. was eschewing the entire philosophy behind arms control.\n\nMoreover, the tactics employed by the U.S. to undermine the credibility of the INF treaty revolved around fabricating a case of alleged Russian violations built around \"intelligence\" about the development of a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile, the 9M729, which the U.S. claimed proved that the new missile was in violation of the INF treaty.\n\nThat the intelligence was never shared with the Russians, further eroded the viability of the U.S. as a treaty partner. When the Russians offered up the actual 9M729 missile for physical inspection to convince the U.S. to remain in the INF treaty, the U.S. balked, preventing not only U.S. officials from participating, but also any of its NATO allies.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. withdrew from the INF treaty in August 2019. Less than a month later, the U.S. carried out a test launch of the Tomahawk cruise missile from a Mk. 41 launch tube. The Russians had been right all along the U.S., in abandoning the ABM treaty, had used the deployment of so-called new ABM sites as a cover for the emplacement of INF-capable ground-launched missiles on Russias doorstep.\n\nAnd yet the U.S. pays no price there is no accountability for such duplicity. Arms control, once a bastion of national integrity and honor, had been reduced to the status of a joke by the actions of the U.S.\n\nNo Trust Left\n\nWith no common language, there can be no common vision, no common purpose. Russia continues to seek arms control agreements which serve to restrict the arsenals of the involved parties to prevent dangerous escalatory actions while imposing a modicum of predictable stability on relations.\n\nThe U.S. seeks only unilateral advantage.\n\nUntil this is changed, there can be no meaningful arms control interaction between the U.S. and Russia. Not only will the New START treaty expire in February 2026, but it is also unlikely the major verification component of the treaty on site inspections will be revived between now and then.\n\nMoreover, it is impossible to see how a new arms control agreement to replace the expired New START treaty could be negotiated, ratified, and implemented in the short time remaining to do so. There is no trust between Russia and the U.S. when it comes to arms control.\n\nWith no treaties, there is no verification of reality. Both the U.S. and Russian arsenals will become untethered from treaty-based constraint, leading to a new arms race for which there can be only one finishing line total nuclear war.\n\nThere is a long list of things that must happen if meaningful arms control is ever to resume its place in the diplomatic arsenals of either the U.S. or Russia. Before either side can resume talking to one another, however, they must first re-learn the common language of disarmament.\n\nBecause the current semantics of arms control is little more than a lexicon for disaster.\n\nScott Ritter is a former U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer who served in the former Soviet Union implementing arms control treaties, in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm and in Iraq overseeing the disarmament of WMD.

Sergey Surovikin at the Joint Forces Headquarters on December 16 in a possible prelude to his planned Belarus trip to meet his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) has a deep dive into this planned meeting and its implications for greater Moscow-Minsk ties and the war on the far side of the Pripyat Marshes. Most likely, Putin will press for further integration of the two countries that have increasingly become one and the same, particularly since the 2021-2022 buildup of Russian troops before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnother campaign against Kyiv is of course a worst-case scenario, but the meeting and its surrounding noise is more likely designed to keep Ukraine convinced that an attack from Belarus is possible at any time.\n\nUkraines worries of a new Kyiv offensive may well be a mix of both actual concern and its continued masterclass in information warfare. For a country fighting for its life, its better to sound the worst possible alarm in hopes that means even greater support. It just makes sense.\n\nBut Russia has used up an immense amount of seasoned manpower, ammunition, vehicles, and other supplies in its nearly 10-month-long war. It seems somewhat unlikely that Russia, or Russia and Belarus together, could mount a strategically successful operation against Kyiv, which has been further hardened against such attack since the war began.\n\nRussia failed spectacularly at taking the capital of Ukraine with the full might of its at the time fresh fighting force. Doing it again severely degraded would be hard to comprehend. In addition, Russia has had major trouble holding ground in the east and south it had won early on, losing huge swathes of it in recent months. The idea that they would be able to take the capital and hold it while also meeting demands elsewhere on the battlefield is highly questionable.\n\nThat's not to say that a feint couldn't take place in an attempt to pull critical Ukrainian resources off the front lines.\n\nAnother possibility is some sort of push from Belarus from the western part of its border with Ukraine. The terrain is more difficult, any element of surprise would be non-existent, and such an operation would be right under the noses of NATO surveillance assets. This would make Ukraine's job of punishing such an action far easier. It would also likely lead to even more military support for Ukraine, due to its proximity to NATO's borders.\n\nOnce again, this could happen, even on a smaller scale, just as a feint or even a sacrificial actual operation aimed at pulling resources away from the south and east. Any real operation there with actual aims beyond that would be focused on trying to interdict the supply lines that run from NATO member countries into Ukraine. A tall order considering Russia's capabilities and the basic geography of the region.\n\nOnce again, the threat alone of such an operation, especially paired with a military buildup of significant scale, could keep Ukrainian forces tied down near the border and thus potentially making its front-line presence thinner. More specifically, the threat from Belarus could limit the number of troops Ukraine could mass for operations to break Russias new defensive lines holding the Donbas, southern Ukraine, and ultimately Crimea.\n\nWhat Russia has is manpower, albeit poorly equipped and poorly trained, which could be used to take advantage of any redistribution of Ukrainian forces from the front. At the very least it could stymie Ukraine's ability to retake more territory, especially Crimea, in the not so distant future. Still, this is a pretty desperate and flimsy strategy that Ukraine would likely overcome.\n\nIntelligence will play an absolutely critical role in assessing what is real and what isn't in terms of Russian intent along Ukraine's northern border. The better the intelligence, the more Ukraine can maximize its forces along the active front.\n\nAnd we must caveat this analysis with the reality that anything is possible at this point. Russia has acted in bizarre and self defeating ways throughout this conflict, so it is possible that they throw massive amounts of lives and equipment at Kyiv again, for whatever purpose, regardless of how illogical it may seem.\n\nBefore we head into the latest coverage from Ukraine, The War Zone readers can get caught up on our previous rolling coverage here.\n\nThe Latest\n\nThe latest intelligence update from the British Ministry of Defense noted a subtle shift in tactics in Russian attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure. While many previous waves of Iranian-supplied drones were launched from occupied Crimea, those used in the latest December 16 attack were launched primarily from the Krasnodar region in southern Russia.\n\nThe update attributed this change to concerns after recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian forces in Crimea, as well as Krasnodar being much closer to where Russia receives the drones from Iran. That said, given Ukraines recent long-range attacks against Russian bomber bases, Krasnodar is well within reach.\n\nThe December 16 attack, while blunted by air defenses, continued the Russian siege on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed 60 missiles were shot down in the raid. One of the missiles overflew former President Petro Poroshenko, who led the country as the war in the Donbas unfolded in 2014 and later took up arms in 2022, at his position in the field.\n\nThe threat of future Iranian ballistic missile deliveries still looms large over the attacks only days after the reported U.S. plan to supply Kyiv with MIM-104 Patriot air defense systems broke cover. The strikes also left behind further missile wreckage like this ruined Kh-101 air-launched cruise missile.\n\nWe wrote about Russias widespread use of these cruise missiles, which have some stealthy features, alongside their Cold War-era cousins the Kh-55 (AS-15 \"Kent\") here. Parallel to the reported Patriot transfer to Ukraine, Greece has reportedly pledged to give its own Russian-made S-300PMU-1 (NATO: SA-20 \"Gargoyle\") systems to Ukraine in exchange for replacement Patriots.\n\nSpeaking of S-300s, it looks like Russia smoked one of its own S-300 decoy launchers for propaganda purposes, but they forgot to remove the \"Z\" identifier.\n\nThe ongoing battle for Bakhmut is still the most intense fighting along the frontline from the Russian border to the Dnieper River line. Video from the Georgian Legion gives an idea of the splintered hellscape where they are facing off against Wagner Group mercenaries.\n\nThe Russians are burning through tanks as part of their lone remaining offensive on Bakhmut, with reportedly staggering losses to Ukrainian forces.\n\nArtillery remains the name of the game with both sides fighting from dug-in positions, but new video shows the trenches offer little protection from above. Drone footage shows the town itself is in unbelievably cratered ruins typical of this wars unforgiving urban warfare.\n\nTheres also a video showing M30A1 GMLRS rocket strikes on Russian positions, showing how HIMARS can be used just as well at the front as it can sniping priority targets deep behind the lines.\n\nJust as important is keeping artillery sufficiently mobile to avoid counter-battery fire, or in this case, a Russian Lancet loitering munition. An undated video shows a Lancet diving on and destroying a Ukrainian M777 155mm howitzer in the field.\n\nTheres also new footage of Ukrainian PzH2000 self-propelled howitzers moving across frosty eastern Ukraine and putting rounds downrange with a textbook shoot-and-scoot mission. We also have a view from inside a formerly Lithuanian self-propelled 120mm mortar carrier variant of the M113.\n\nVideo also showed renewed use of 9M22S Grad 122mm incendiary rockets over Bakhmut.\n\nRussian forces have reportedly built a light protective shield over nuclear waste storage at the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The report from Reuters stated a more robust shield will be built, as the current screen protects only against light shelling and drones.\n\nElsewhere on the frontline, we have a clip of a Ukrainian-operated YPR-765 APC tanking a hit from a Russian rocket-propelled grenade and belting out .50-caliber rounds in return fire.\n\nTheres also a new improvised multiple-launched rocket system (MLRS) in the form of an 80mm rocket pod mounted on the back of a Humvee.\n\nLastly and on a lighter note, Ukraines Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted the delivery of a large humanitarian aid package received from South Korea including generators, medical equipment, vaccines and cancer treatment drugs.\n\nWe will continue to update this story until we state otherwise.",

Three people were hospitalized with injuries, he said, adding that 354 homes were without electricity and many others were without natural gas.\n\nThe Aquarium Museum in Sevastopol reported the storm tore through the complex, killing all of the estimated 800 animals housed in the facility.\n\nOne death has been reported by officials in Crimea, where a storm warning remained in effect on November 27. Another death was reported on Telegram channels but not confirmed.\n\nIn war-wracked Ukraine, inclement weather adds to people's hardships caused by Russian strikes on the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nHeavy snowfall across the country prompted the closure of 14 highways, while 16 of Ukraine's 24 regions were experiencing power cuts. Especially harsh conditions were reported in the southern regions of Odesa and Mykolayiv, where snow drifts as high as 2 meters hampered traffic. Seventy-one accidents, nine with injuries, were reported in Odesa and the Odesa region.\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry said a total of 2,019 settlements in 16 regions have been left without electricity, while 1,370 trucks remain stranded, and 840 cars had to be towed.\n\nIn the Russian-occupied part of the Kherson region, 94 settlements were without electricity, said Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the region. The wind knocked down nine power lines and damaged more than 50 towers, and communications and Internet have been disrupted.\n\nAuthorities in Romania and neighboring Moldova said hundreds of cities and villages have been left without electricity and water in the two countries following heavy snowfall and blizzards that prompted severe disruption of road and railway traffic.\n\nRailway traffic has resumed in southeastern Romania, but 21 national highways remained closed as of November 27, authorities said, while schools in five southeastern counties -- Braila, Galati, Tulcea, Calarasi, and Constanta -- were also closed.\n\nA total of 22 counties out of 41 and 170 villages and cities in the southeast of the country, including Bucharest, were affected by power cuts.\n\nIn Moldova, 123,000 people from almost 200 localities were left without electricity. One man died when his car veered off the snow-covered road and hit a tree on November 26, police said, adding that several other traffic accidents had been reported.\n\nSixteen Moldovans were injured when their bus was overturned by the blizzard on a highway in southern Romania, police said. Emergency services transported several injured people to the hospital.\n\nIn Bulgaria, snowfall and blizzards prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in several areas in the northeast of the Balkan country -- Silistra and Razgrad regions, Valchi dol municipality, Varna region, and Shumen region. Some 1,000 settlements were without electricity, Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said at an emergency government meeting on November 26.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Russian Service, Digi24.ro, hotnews.ro, unimedia.md, AP, and Reuters",

Putins War A Times investigation based on interviews, intercepts, documents and secret battle plans shows how a \"walk in the park\" became a catastrophe for Russia. They never had a chance. Fumbling blindly through cratered farms, the troops from Russias 155th Naval Infantry Brigade had no maps, medical kits or working walkie-talkies, they said. Just a few weeks earlier, they had been factory workers and truck drivers, watching an endless showcase of supposed Russian military victories at home on state television before being drafted in September. One medic was a former barista who had never had any medical training. Now, they were piled onto the tops of overcrowded armored vehicles, lumbering through fallow autumn fields with Kalashnikov rifles from half a century ago and virtually nothing to eat, they said. Russia had been at war most of the year, yet its army seemed less prepared than ever. In interviews, members of the brigade said some of them had barely fired a gun before and described having almost no bullets anyway, let alone air cover or artillery. But it didnt frighten them too much, they said. They would never see combat, their commanders had promised. Only when the shells began crashing around them, ripping their comrades to pieces, did they realize how badly they had been duped. Flung to the ground, a drafted Russian soldier named Mikhail recalled opening his eyes to a shock: the shredded bodies of his comrades littering the field. Shrapnel had sliced open his belly, too. Desperate to escape, he said, he crawled to a thicket of trees and tried to dig a ditch with his hands. Of the 60 members of his platoon near the eastern Ukrainian town of Pavlivka that day in late October, about 40 were killed, said Mikhail, speaking by phone from a military hospital outside Moscow. Only eight, he said, escaped serious injury. \"This isnt war,\" Mikhail said, struggling to speak through heavy, liquid breaths. \"Its the destruction of the Russian people by their own commanders.\" 1. Blunders It took four days for Russia to strike an obvious target. By then it was too late. 2. Hubris Putin summoned many of Russias most powerful businessmen into a trap. 3. Internal Rot The Kremlin spent big on the military. \"A new Potemkin village\" went up instead. 4. Collapsing Front As Russia stumbled, the U.S. tried to save a Russian generals life. 5. Divided Ranks The Russian tank blew up its own checkpoint. It was no accident. 6. Cannon Fodder At least your son didnt drink himself to death, Putin told a bereaved mother. President Vladimir V. Putins war was never supposed to be like this. When the head of the C.I.A. traveled to Moscow last year to warn against invading Ukraine, he found a supremely confident Kremlin, with Mr. Putins national security adviser boasting that Russias cutting-edge armed forces were strong enough to stand up even to the Americans. Russian invasion plans, obtained by The New York Times, show that the military expected to sprint hundreds of miles across Ukraine and triumph within days. Officers were told to pack their dress uniforms and medals in anticipation of military parades in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. But instead of that resounding victory, with tens of thousands of his troops killed and parts of his army in shambles after nearly 10 months of war, Mr. Putin faces something else entirely: his nations greatest human and strategic calamity since the collapse of the Soviet Union. A dead Russian soldier in Kharkiv the day after the war started in February. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times How could one of the worlds most powerful militaries, led by a celebrated tactician like Mr. Putin, have faltered so badly against its much smaller, weaker rival? To piece together the answer, we drew from hundreds of Russian government emails, documents, invasion plans, military ledgers and propaganda directives. We listened to Russian phone calls from the battlefield and spoke with dozens of soldiers, senior officials and Putin confidants who have known him for decades. A Russian logbook detailing the movement of airborne troops from Belarus toward Kyiv, including attacks and \"nonstop fire\" by Ukrainian forces. Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. The Times investigation found a stunning cascade of mistakes that started with Mr. Putin profoundly isolated in the pandemic, obsessed with his legacy, convinced of his own brilliance and continued long after drafted soldiers like Mikhail were sent to the slaughter. At every turn, the failures ran deeper than previously known: In interviews, Putin associates said he spiraled into self-aggrandizement and anti-Western zeal, leading him to make the fateful decision to invade Ukraine in near total isolation, without consulting experts who saw the war as pure folly. Aides and hangers-on fueled his many grudges and suspicions, a feedback loop that one former confidant likened to the radicalizing effect of a social-media algorithm. Even some of the presidents closest advisers were left in the dark until the tanks began to move. As another longtime confidant put it, \"Putin decided that his own thinking would be enough.\" The Russian military, despite Western assumptions about its prowess, was severely compromised, gutted by years of theft. Hundreds of billions of dollars had been devoted to modernizing the armed forces under Mr. Putin, but corruption scandals ensnared thousands of officers. One military contractor described frantically hanging enormous patriotic banners to hide the decrepit conditions at a major Russian tank base, hoping to fool a delegation of top brass. The visitors were even prevented from going inside to use the bathroom, he said, lest they discover the ruse. Once the invasion began, Russia squandered its dominance over Ukraine through a parade of blunders. It relied on old maps and bad intelligence to fire its missiles, leaving Ukrainian air defenses surprisingly intact, ready to defend the country. Russias vaunted hacking squads tried, and failed, to win in what some officials call the first big test of cyberweapons in actual warfare. Russian soldiers, many shocked they were going to war, used their cellphones to call home, allowing the Ukrainians to track them and pick them off in large numbers. And Russias armed forces were so stodgy and sclerotic that they did not adapt, even after enduring huge losses on the battlefield. While their planes were being shot down, many Russian pilots flew as if they faced no danger, almost like they were at an air show. Stretched thin by its grand ambitions, Russia seized more territory than it could defend, leaving thousands of square miles in the hands of skeleton crews of underfed, undertrained and poorly equipped fighters. Many were conscripts or ragtag separatists from Ukraines divided east, with gear from the 1940s or little more than printouts from the internet describing how to use a sniper rifle, suggesting soldiers learned how to fight on the fly. With new weapons from the West in hand, the Ukrainians beat them back, yet Russian commanders kept sending waves of ground troops into pointless assaults, again and again. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" one Russian soldier said he realized after being ordered into a fifth march directly in the sights of Ukrainian artillery. Finally, he and his demoralized comrades refused to go. A Soviet-era map of modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia recovered from the battlefield. Mr. Putin divided his war into fiefs, leaving no one powerful enough to challenge him. Many of his fighters are commanded by people who are not even part of the military, like his former bodyguard, the leader of Chechnya and a mercenary boss who has provided catering for Kremlin events. As the initial invasion failed, the atomized approach only deepened, chipping away at an already disjointed war effort. Now, Mr. Putins fractured armies often function like rivals, competing for weapons and, at times, viciously turning on one another. One soldier recounted how the clashes became violent, with a Russian tank commander deliberately charging at his supposed allies and blowing up their checkpoint. Since the early days of the invasion, Mr. Putin has conceded, privately, that the war has not gone as planned. During a meeting in March with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, Mr. Putin admitted that the Ukrainians were tougher \"than I was told,\" according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"This will probably be much more difficult than we thought. But the war is on their territory, not ours. We are a big country and we have patience.\" People who know Mr. Putin say he is ready to sacrifice untold lives and treasure for as long as it takes, and in a rare face-to-face meeting with the Americans last month the Russians wanted to deliver a stark message to President Biden: No matter how many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded on the battlefield, Russia will not give up. One NATO member is warning allies that Mr. Putin is ready to accept the deaths or injuries of as many as 300,000 Russian troops roughly three times his estimated losses so far. Just days after facing blowback about the war from normally friendly leaders in September, Mr. Putin doubled down on the invasion, calling up hundreds of thousands of Russians in a draft that was supposed to turn the war in Russias favor, but has instead stirred growing anger at home. Soon after, hundreds of Russian soldiers were killed outside Pavlivka, including Mikhails drafted comrades in the blind advance of the 155th. \"Legs, guts. I mean, meat. Just meat,\" another member of the platoon, Aleksandr, said from a hospital in Russia. \"I know it sounds terrible, but you cant describe it any other way. People were turned into hamburger.\" Aleksandr recounted how he and his fellow draftees had asked their instructor in Russia what they could possibly learn about firing a gun and becoming soldiers in the few weeks before being sent to Ukraine. \"He was honest: Nothing,\" Aleksandr said the instructor responded.

He has killed tens of thousands in Ukraine, leveled cities and targeted civilians for maximum pain obliterating hospitals, schools and apartment buildings, while cutting off power and water to millions before winter. Each time Ukrainian forces score a major blow against Russia, the bombing of their country intensifies. And Mr. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world that he can use anything at his disposal, including nuclear arms, to pursue his notion of victory. Emergency services at the site of a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia, in October. Nicole Tung for The New York Times As far back as January, with the United States warning that Russias invasion of Ukraine was imminent, a retired Russian general named Leonid Ivashov saw disaster on the horizon. In a rare open letter, he warned that using force against Ukraine would threaten \"the very existence of Russia as a state.\" In a recent phone interview, General Ivashov said that his warnings before the war echoed what he had been hearing from nervous Russian military officials at the time. Though the Kremlin insisted an invasion was not on the table, some could tell otherwise. Service members told him that \"victory in such a situation is impossible,\" he said, but their superiors told them not to worry. A war would be a \"walk in the park,\" they were told. The last 10 months, he went on, have turned out to be \"even more tragic\" than predicted. Nimble Ukrainian generals and soldiers have outmaneuvered a much bigger, more lethal foe. The West, cheered by Ukraines successes, has provided ever more powerful weapons to drive the Russians back. \"Never in its history has Russia made such stupid decisions,\" General Ivashov said. \"Alas, today stupidity has triumphed stupidity, greed, a kind of vengefulness and even a kind of malice.\" Mr. Putins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, blames the West, and the weapons it has given Ukraine, for Russias unexpected difficulties in the war. \"This is a big burden for us,\" Mr. Peskov said, depicting Russia as taking on all of NATOs military might in Ukraine. \"It was just very hard to believe in such cynicism and in such bloodthirstiness on the part of the collective West.\" Some of the wars original supporters are starting to reckon with the idea of defeat. Before the invasion, American intelligence agencies identified Oleg Tsaryov as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install once it took over Ukraine. His faith in the war has since slipped away.

As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. As missiles struck the southern city of Mykolaiv before dawn, a Ukrainian pilot, Oleksii, woke up to a phone call: Get to the runway, a fellow pilot told him. Oleksii bolted across the tarmac in the dark as the first Russian missiles landed, clambered into his Su-27 fighter jet and took off just as buildings across the airfield began to explode. \"At that moment, I understood that it was really something bad,\" said Oleksii, 26, on condition that only his first name and rank, captain, be used. Some other soldiers and officials in this article were not authorized to speak publicly, or faced reprisals. Just before 6 a.m. Moscow time, Mr. Putin declared the opening of his \"special military operation\" in a televised address. It began with an aerial bombardment to take out Ukraines air defenses, communications and radar installations to overwhelm its military and shatter its ability to fight back. More than 150 missiles thundered into Ukraine from bombers, submarines and ships. As many as 75 Russian aircraft streaked into Ukrainian skies, about the size of Ukraines entire working air combat fleet, analysts and officials said. On his radar screen, Oleksii saw the blips of incoming missiles and enemy aircraft before getting his orders: Fly to a backup air base in central Ukraine. When he landed, he was astonished. Not only was his unit there, but a good portion of Ukraines remaining air force as well. For days, he and his fellow pilots flew missions from their new base, wondering when Russian radar operators would finally notice them. A strike on their position could have been disastrous, gutting the Ukrainian defense, and the pilots assumed it was only a matter of time until one came. But it took four days for the Russians to attack, and most of the aircraft had moved to new locations by then, leaving Oleksii in amazement. \"It was really simple,\" he said. \"I dont know how they missed this opportunity.\" The failure to destroy Ukraines modest air defenses was one of the most significant blunders of the war, foiling Russias mighty air force early on. Interviews revealed why that happened and how the Ukrainians managed to stay a step ahead of their invaders. Russia invades Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA Ukraine should have been overwhelmed. By one count, its fighter jets were outnumbered 15 to one in some early air battles. Russias planes were also more advanced, helping its pilots see farther and strike from greater distances. Russia had thousands of cruise and ballistic missiles that should have smothered Ukraines aging, Soviet-era defenses. That is what American and Ukrainian intelligence officials assumed, anyway, leading to predictions that Ukraine would fall within days. So, Ukraine shuffled the deck. It moved some of its defenses like Buk and S-300 missile launchers, along with its primary radio intelligence command and control center to new sites before the war began, senior Ukrainian officials said. Russian missiles often hit the old locations instead. In all, as many as 60 percent of Russian cruise missiles missed their intended targets, American officials said. Part of Russias problem was agility. Even if Russian forces had spotted Oleksii and his fellow pilots bunched together at their new rendezvous point, American officials said, Russias military was so rigid and centralized that it typically needed 48 to 72 hours to update its intelligence and get approval to go after new targets by which time the Ukrainians were gone. That same inflexibility made the Russians easy to hit. After failing to take out Ukraines defenses, many Russian pilots kept flying as if they had. Their ground-attack planes often flew sorties without backup from other fighter jets, the Ukrainians said, enabling outgunned pilots like Oleksii to catch them off-guard by flying at low altitudes, hidden from radar, and roaring up from below to shoot them down. The debris of a Russian Su-34 aircraft that crashed into a residential neighborhood in Chernihiv in March. David Guttenfelder for The New York Times \"Maybe the Russian Army didnt read the Soviet books,\" Oleksii said. \"They flew straight without any cover. They had bombs, they had rockets, but they didnt cover their attack aircraft.\" Then in March, when Russian pilots finally changed tactics and started flying low enough to duck under Ukrainian air defense radar, they fell into the sights of Ukrainian missiles, including shoulder-fired Stingers provided by the United States. For Russian troops on the ground, it was a disaster. Without air cover, they were suddenly far more vulnerable, throwing their troubled march toward Kyiv and other large cities further into disarray. Though tens of thousands of them had amassed along Ukraines borders, hovering menacingly as if eager to strike, many never thought they were actually going to war. Like most of Russia, they figured it was just for show, to extract concessions from the West. Interviews with Russian soldiers show how stunned they were when the orders came to invade. Cpl. Nikita Chibrin, a 27-year-old soldier in a motorized infantry brigade, said he had spent the month before in Belarus on what he and his fellow soldiers were told was a training exercise. On Feb. 23, he said, he and his unit were at their camp celebrating the Defender of the Fatherland holiday, snacking on candy they had been given for the occasion, when their commander approached. \"Tomorrow you are going to Ukraine to fuck up some shit,\" he said the commander told them. There was no further explanation. Before dawn on the 24th, Corporal Chibrin and his comrades loaded into a tracked armored personnel carrier. They had no instructions and no idea where they were headed, he said. Another Russian soldier stationed in Belarus said he found out he was going to war only an hour before his unit began to march. The order was both simple and wildly optimistic: Follow the vehicle in front of you and reach Kyiv within 18 hours. According to the units schedule and logbook which were obtained by The Times and reviewed by three independent military analysts, who considered them authentic the first vehicles in his convoy were supposed to punch down from Belarus and arrive on the outskirts of Kyiv by 2:55 p.m., even faster than the soldier was told. A Russian military timetable showing a detailed schedule of movement for airborne troops set to depart Belarus, and arrive on Kyivs outskirts. Source: Ukraines military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R. He didnt come close. The massive vehicles were so heavy, ripping up the roads as they tried to move forward, that the convoy got bogged down immediately, the soldier said. It took more than a day just to cross the border into Ukraine. It got worse from there. The logbook recorded day after day of delays, Ukrainian attacks and hundreds of injuries, deaths and destroyed vehicles. Secret orders for a different Russian force obtained by The Times and shared with four independent military analysts, all of whom said they were credible were issued only hours before Mr. Putins announcement. The orders, for a unit of the 26th Tank Regiment, were oddly overconfident, to the point of being contradictory. They anticipated a tangle of possible resistance from Ukrainian troops and planes, yet they still laid out a mostly uninhibited, 24-hour dash from Ukraines border with Russia to a point across the Dnipro River, about 250 miles away. There, the unit would dig in, about two hours outside Kyiv, and block Ukrainian troops sweeping in from the south and east, the Russian war plans said. And no matter how fierce the enemy was, the unit was expected to complete the mission on its own. A document recovered from the 26th tank regiment detailing invasion plans issued on Feb. 23, 2022. \"There are no forces or equipment for reinforcements,\" the orders said. Sure enough, the lumbering, largely unprotected Russian columns proved enticing targets. On March 17, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander of Ukrainian forces, posted a video of burning tanks that he said belonged to the 26th Tank Regiment in northeastern Ukraine hundreds of kilometers short of its intended destination. The unit lost 16 vehicles in less than three weeks, according to Russian documents seized and published by Ukraine. The mother of one young tank soldier on the units roster told Russian media that her son was brought home in pieces, identified only by his DNA. Across Ukraine, the Russian losses mounted. A giant armored column of more than 30,000 troops at the core of Russias force pushing south toward the city of Chernihiv was eviscerated by a motley group of Ukrainian defenders outnumbered five to one, soldiers and senior officials said. The Ukrainians hid in the forest and picked apart the Russian column with shoulder-fired antitank weapons, like American-made Javelins. A Ukrainian soldier carrying an NLAW anti-tank guided missile as he walks toward a destroyed Russian armored column at a junction near Ivankiv, northwest of Kyiv, filmed between Feb. 24-26. Lyubov Shelkovich, via Facebook One Russian soldier in the unit said he was shocked by the swiftness of the Ukrainian attack. \"In the first battle, the column was ambushed, and I was wounded, and thats it,\" he said. \"For 24 hours, I was missing a leg, lying in a field waiting for my unit to come get me.\" The rout near Chernihiv spoiled part of Russias plan to envelop Kyiv. Ukrainian soldiers walking along a street where a column of Russian military vehicles was destroyed near Chernihiv in April. Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times A massacre at the Antonov Airport spoiled another. Russian forces had counted on the element of surprise when wave upon wave of helicopters descended on the airport, home to the largest aircraft in the world: the An-225 Mriya, a cargo plane with a 290-foot wingspan that was an object of Ukrainian national pride. Taking the airport would give Russian forces a beachhead to ferry in troops for the assault on Ukraines capital. But the Ukrainians expected as much. Using shoulder-fired missiles, they shot down Russian aircraft and killed as many as 300 Russian paratroopers, according to senior American and Ukrainian officials and the captured Russian logbook. Fierce battles in the following days destroyed much of the airport, including the prized Mriya cargo jet, but thwarted Russias plans. \"Yes, we lost our Mriya,\" said Col. Yuriy Ignat, the spokesman for Ukraines Air Force Command. \"But as a result the airport wasnt lost.\" Russia not only botched the attack by land and air, but also put too much faith in another wing of its vaunted arsenal: hacking. Even before the first missiles and shots were fired, unit 74455 of the Russian Military Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., tried to infiltrate Ukrainian networks and shut them down. Officials in Washington, who had been working closely with the Ukrainians to bolster their cyberdefenses for years, had been holding their breath. States had mainly used hacking for acts of espionage and financial thievery, for subversion and sabotage. But nobody really knew how it would play out in a full-scale military conflict. \"All this stuff that has been written about cyberwar has been speculative,\" said a senior U.S. defense official. \"For the first time, you have war and cyber together the real thing.\" The Russian hacking unit, known as Sandworm, had long menaced Ukraine, waging attacks against the power grid starting in 2015. But it was labor intensive, and only somewhat effective. By one estimate, it took Sandworm about 19 months to prepare the attack on a power station in western Ukraine, yet it only caused a six-hour power outage. A snippet of code used by hackers to try to disable Ukrainian government computers. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency A cyber cat-and-mouse game ensued, with the United States, Britain and other allies helping to shore up Ukrainian computers and stave off Russian intrusions. On Feb. 23, hours before the invasion began, Sandworm took another swing, launching malware that infected several hundred Ukrainian government computers, officials said. The intrusion was detected quickly, the damage contained. Then Sandworm struck again. But the code it used looked like it had been thrown together at the last minute, with programming errors another fail. Sandworm wasnt done. In its boldest stroke yet, it went after the Ukrainian militarys satellite communications, used by soldiers in the field. It worked, and by 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 24, the system went down, right at Ukraines most vulnerable moment. It could have been a crippling blow. But the Ukrainian government had a backup plan: a separate satellite communications system, which it had tested only two months before, to make sure it was ready in the event of a Russian invasion. Russia had assumed its forces would march largely uncontested into Kyiv. When that didnt happen, American officials suspect that Sandworm like the rest of the Russian military was caught off guard. Soon, Russias missteps went from the sophisticated to the mundane. With their plans for a speedy victory stymied, Russian forces were suddenly confronted with the most basic of problems: They hadnt brought enough food, water or other supplies for a prolonged campaign. Soldiers resorted to looting grocery stores, hospitals and homes. Security camera footage showing Russian soldiers looting a shop, said to be in Kherson, on Feb. 28. u_now, via Telegram \"The guys were going from apartment to apartment and taking out large bags looting in all its glory,\" one Russian soldier wrote in mid-March in his diary, which was recovered by Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine and shared with a Times reporter embedded with them. \"Some take only what they need, some take everything, from old nonfunctional phones to plasma TVs, computers, and expensive alcohol.\" In the diary, the soldier recounts hunting for medicine, food and other essentials, describing the joy his men felt entering a grocery store. \"We found everything that we lacked so much, even sweets,\" the soldier wrote. \"Everyone rejoiced like children.\" A page from the diary of a Russian soldier, recovered by Ukrainian troops, that described scavenging for candy and socks. He recounts nearly dying in a mortar attack and stalking a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier. But just as often, he appears concerned with basic provisions for himself and his comrades, describing how they scoured a hospital and came up with jam, cookies and raisins. Two days later, he had more luck. \"I found socks that are now worth their weight in gold,\" he wrote. Some Russian troops panicked, and even resorted to self-sabotage. One Pentagon intelligence report said that Russian military drivers were poking holes in their gas tanks, disabling their own vehicles to avoid going into battle. The commander of a Ukrainian tank repair depot said some 30 Russian T-80 tanks in seemingly perfect condition were taken and delivered to him at the beginning of the war. When his mechanics inspected, they found sand had been poured into the fuel tanks, rendering them inoperable. Ukrainian law enforcement officials started noticing something else suspicious as well: a spike in foreign cellphone numbers near the border, in the forests between Ukraine and Belarus. Russian soldiers were using cellphones to call home, and suddenly popping up on Ukrainian networks. Officials who monitor the traffic during peacetime for criminal activity quickly realized they could see and hear the invaders approaching in real time. \"We listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives,\" said an official who oversees the phone intercepts. \"They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.\" Down long corridors guarded by locks with facial detection, behind doors sealed with wax to detect intruders, teams of women tracked the Russian troops from small listening booths while their friends and relatives grabbed rifles to patrol the streets. \"We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using,\" the official said. The eavesdroppers passed the details to Ukraines armed forces to carry out ambushes and counterattacks. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraines military intelligence, said Ukrainian forces used cellphone signals and even TikTok videos to target a unit of Chechen soldiers known as the Kadyrovtsy, named for the strongman leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. It took 40 minutes from the time one video was uploaded to pinpoint the units location near the Hostomel airport northwest of Kyiv, Mr. Budanov said. The Ukrainian military then hit them with three Tochka-U ballistic missiles, he said. The Russians kept closing in on Kyiv, forcing the eavesdroppers tucked in listening rooms to make a quick decision: destroy their equipment and flee for their own safety, or hang on and continue gathering intelligence. They stayed. \"We didnt lose Ukraine. We didnt let the enemy move further,\" the official said. \"On the first days, when they made foolish mistakes, we used their foolish mistakes to our advantage.\"\n\nHubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Consumed by his legacy, stewing in resentment against the West, Mr. Putin drove his country to war to seal his place in Russian history. Hubris\n\n\"They saw a czar in him.

He boasted of wielding a modernized military behemoth, a far cry from its post-Soviet shell. Watching from afar, the West believed him. William J. Burns, the director of the C.I.A., flew to Moscow, sat in a conference room near the Kremlin and waited until the formalities were over before explaining the real reason he had come. It was early November 2021. The United States believed Mr. Putin was considering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Burns explained. If he proceeded down this path, Mr. Burns warned, the West would respond decisively, in unison and the consequences for Russia would be severe. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Mr. Putins security council, stiffened and looked Mr. Burns in the eye, officials in the room said. He abandoned his notes and extolled the prowess of Russias armed forces. They had been so thoroughly modernized under Mr. Putin that they now rivaled the United States militarily, he said. \"Patrushev didnt qualify it,\" said John Sullivan, the American ambassador to Russia at the time, who was there. \"He was just looking at Burns and saying: We can do this. Were back. The way I would describe it was that this was already decided, and they were supremely confident. His message was, Its not going to be a problem for us to do what we want to do.\" Mr. Burns briefed Mr. Biden upon his return to Washington, officials said. Mr. Putin had all but made up his mind to take over Ukraine, Mr. Burns told him, and the Russians had absolute confidence victory would come swiftly. To Mr. Putin, Ukraine is an artificial nation, used by the West to weaken Russia. He describes it as a cradle of Russian culture, a centerpiece of Russian identity that must be wrested back from the West and returned to Russias orbit. In his eyes, that is the biggest unfinished mission of his 22 years in power, people who know him say. He began as an unassuming bureaucrat-turned-president on New Years Eve, 1999, seen by the inner circle of his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, as a proficient manager who could bring stability without threatening the ruling elite. By his third decade in power, Mr. Putin seems transformed, people who have known him since the 1990s say. He styles himself as a pivotal figure astride a millennium of Russian history as he hinted when he unveiled a statue of Vladimir the Great, the medieval prince of Kyiv, outside the Kremlin walls in 2016. That Vladimir \"entered history as a uniter and protector of Russian lands,\" Mr. Putin said. The Vladimir at Russias helm in the 21st century, Mr. Putin has increasingly made plain, sees himself as carrying on that tradition. \"If everyone around you is telling you for 22 years that you are a super-genius, then you will start to believe that this is who you are,\" said Oleg Tinkov, a former Russian banking tycoon who turned against Mr. Putin this year. \"Russian businesspeople, Russian officials, the Russian people they saw a czar in him. He just went nuts.\" Mr. Putin rose to power as a deft politician. He could flash charm, humility and a smile, painting himself as a reasonable leader to Russians and foreigners. He knew how to control his facial muscles in tense conversations, leaving his eyes as the only guide to his emotions, people who know him said. But during his presidency, he increasingly wallowed in a swirl of grievances and obsessions: the Wests supposed disregard for the Soviet Unions role in defeating Nazi Germany; the fear that NATO would base nuclear missiles in Ukraine to strike Moscow; modern-day gender politics in which, Mr. Putin often says, Mom and Dad are being replaced by \"Parent No. 1 and Parent No. 2.\" In the personalist system he has built, those quirks have global consequences. \"What he thinks about obsessively, and quite possibly falsely,\" has ended up shaping \"the biography of the whole world,\" said Konstantin Remchukov, a Moscow newspaper editor. Mr. Putin seemed to think that only he truly understood Ukraine. After annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, Mr. Putin bragged that he had overruled his own advisers, who had considered the move too dangerous because of the risk of sanctions and a Ukrainian military response. Back then, Mr. Putins instincts mostly proved right. The Ukrainian military withdrew swiftly from Crimea some soldiers and sailors switched sides to join Russia and the Wests limited sanctions scarcely affected Russias economy, sealing Mr. Putins confidence. \"I took responsibility for everything,\" Mr. Putin said after taking Crimea, according to a confidant. \"I will be gone sooner or later, but Crimea will have been returned to Russia forever.\" A pro-Russian rally on Crimea in 2014, the year Russia seized the peninsula. Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Many of the people closest to Mr. Putin had an incentive to cater to the bosss rising self-regard and to magnify the external threats and historical injustices that Mr. Putin saw himself as fighting against. A former Putin confidant compared the dynamic to the radicalization spiral of a social media algorithm, feeding users content that provokes an emotional reaction. \"They read his mood and they start to slip him that kind of stuff,\" he said. By the summer of 2021, during a meeting that was supposed to be about the economy, Mr. Putin railed instead against the West and President George W. Bushs withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, which Mr. Putin often cites as one of Americas great post-Cold War sins. \"We tried to partner with the West for many years, but the partnership was not accepted, it didnt work,\" Mr. Putin said, recalled his guest, who sat on the other end of a long table. The words had a sort of finality to them, the visitor said: \"It was like he was talking to himself, not to me.\" The guest had spent three days in quarantine before meeting with Mr. Putin at a distance of roughly 15 feet. It was a \"light\" option the Kremlin offered to people who sought face time with Mr. Putin but wanted to avoid the lengthy quarantines required for an up-close meeting with him, even in the pandemics second year. Mr. Putin meeting with his defense minister and a top military official in February. The photo was released by Russian state media. Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik, via Reuters Mr. Putins isolation deepened his radicalization, people who know him say. He went 16 months without meeting a single Western leader in person. He held just about all his meetings by videoconference from nondescript rooms that left his exact location a mystery. Those who got to see him in person saw their influence rise in a system in which access to Mr. Putin referred to as \"the boss\" or \"V.V.,\" his first initials, by insiders is the most valuable of currencies. \"Our most important resource is not a medal, not money and not possession of anything,\" said Konstantin Zatulin, a member of Parliament in Mr. Putins United Russia party. \"Our main, most important resource is access to the president.\" On that score, Yuri Kovalchuk, a conservative physicist and banking magnate who befriended Mr. Putin in the 1990s, did well during the pandemic. Mr. Kovalchuk bragged last year that he had spent several months in 2020 with Mr. Putin at his residence on Lake Valdai, between St. Petersburg and Moscow, according to a person who met with him then. Mr. Kovalchuk told the person that Mr. Putins main achievement was \"militarization\" the creation of an army and a society ready for war. The secretive Mr. Kovalchuk prides himself as a strategist who sees Russia locked in an existential battle with the West, according to people who know him. In the last decade, he has expanded his television and newspaper holdings, key parts of the Kremlins propaganda apparatus. A onetime Putin confidant said Mr. Kovalchuk sees himself \"as a visionary,\" and the pandemic, given the extraordinary precautions Mr. Putin took, emerged as an opportunity for Mr. Kovalchuk to deepen his imprint on the president and the nation. Mr. Putins unfinished business with Ukraine also fed a growing personal animus toward Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraines president, Volodymyr Zelensky, at a news conference in Kyiv in March. Lynsey Addario for The New York Times When Mr. Zelensky was elected in a landslide in 2019, the Kremlin saw him as someone it could work with: a Russian-speaking comedian who had lived in Moscow, performed on Russian television and won with a message of ending the war in eastern Ukraine that Russia had fueled. And partly because Mr. Zelensky is Jewish, some in Moscow expected him to be tough on Ukraines nationalist wing, which venerated Ukrainian independence fighters who had fought alongside the Nazis in the closing battles of World War II. \"I think he is sincerely willing\" to compromise with Russia, Mr. Putin said of Mr. Zelensky in 2019. \"It is his sincere conviction, at least his striving.\" By early 2021, the Kremlins hopes had been dashed. Mr. Zelensky cracked down on pro-Russian interests in Ukraine, shutting down pro-Russian television channels and sanctioning Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch close to Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin showed his frustration in a long meeting at his Sochi residence with Mr. Bennett, the new prime minister of Israel, in October 2021. Mr. Putin charmed his guest, taking him into his private residence and pouring him a glass of whiskey. But when it came to Ukraine, Mr. Putin flashed anger. Mr. Bennett noted that Mr. Zelensky was interested in meeting Mr. Putin face to face. \"I have nothing to discuss with this person,\" Mr. Putin shot back, according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"What kind of Jew is he? Hes an enabler of Nazism.\" Some Western officials believe that, by that point, Mr. Putin may have already decided to go to war. But in Russia, even among those with access to Mr. Putin or his inner circle, almost no one thought that the president was seriously considering a full-scale invasion, people close to the Kremlin said. They were sure he was bluffing. Mr. Remchukov, the newspaper editor, was one of them. As the chairman of the 2018 election campaign of Mayor Sergei S. Sobyanin of Moscow Mr. Putins former chief of staff he felt well-connected enough to happily announce to his wife a week before the invasion, \"Lena, there wont be a war!\" That day, he had met for two hours with several senior military officials. Rather than betray any hint of tension, they bantered about Mr. Remchukovs newly svelte physique, queried him in detail about his weight-loss regimen and casually discussed their vacation plans for early March. After he came home and described the meeting to his wife, he said, \"she kissed me and said: What happiness!\" The Americans, by contrast, feared the worst. On Feb. 22, two days before the invasion, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, went to the Pentagon and said his nation desperately needed Stingers, the shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III offered to help before asking how the Ukrainian government planned to keep running after the Russians invaded. \"If you get pushed out of Kyiv,\" he said, \"where are you going to go?\" Mr. Kuleba replied: \"I cant even acknowledge that. Were not even going to talk about that or think about that.\" \"Yeah, I got that,\" Mr. Austin said. \"But you need a plan.\" Soon, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined in, launching into what a senior American defense official described as a \"youre going to die speech.\" \"Theyre going to roll into Kyiv in a few days,\" General Milley said. \"Theyre coming in with tanks and columns of formations. You need to be ready for that. You need to be prepared. If youre not, its going to be a slaughter.\" As General Milley spoke, Mr. Kuleba and members of his delegation sat back in their chairs, their eyes widening. The Ukrainian air force had trained with NATO members since 2011, and the partnership deepened after Russia took Crimea in 2014. Wary of another invasion, they carried out combat exercises in Ukraine and California, preparing the nations air force to take on its technologically superior enemy. In February, a secretive U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard team called Grey Wolf was set up at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to support the Ukrainians. But General Milley still harbored serious doubts about Ukraines state of readiness. He had walked the halls of the Pentagon that winter with an enormous green map of Ukraine, with increasingly ominous projections from U.S. intelligence agencies of Russias invasion plans. Whats more, the American defense attach at the embassy in Kyiv had spent weeks trying to get Ukraines defensive plans, and the ones she received minimized, in the Pentagons view, the Russian threat. Mr. Austin seemed somewhat uncomfortable at General Milleys blunt admonishment of the Ukrainian foreign minister and chimed in, reassuringly: \"Were going to do what we can to help these guys.\" The reality was slow to sink in for many in Moscow, too. Mr. Zatulin, a senior Putin ally in Russias Parliament, said he got his first inkling that the president was serious about an invasion in mid-February. Though known as a leading expert on Ukraine, Mr. Zatulin said he was never consulted on the possibility. To the contrary, Mr. Zatulin said he was scheduled to give an address to the Russian Parliament on behalf of Mr. Putins United Russia party on Feb. 15 that was supposed to signal the opposite that there would be no invasion unless Mr. Zelensky himself went on the offensive in Ukraines divided east. But just five minutes before the session was scheduled to start, Mr. Zatulin said, he got a message from an aide: The partys leadership had canceled his speech. \"I was not ready for this turn of events,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"Everything connected to this decision turned out to be a surprise not just for me, but also for a great many of the people in power.\" Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putins spokesman, insisted that he found out about the invasion only once it had begun. Likewise, Anton Vaino, Mr. Putins chief of staff, and Aleksei Gromov, Mr. Putins powerful media adviser, also said they did not know in advance, according to people who spoke to them about it. The best that senior aides could do was to try to read Mr. Putins body language. Some reported with concern that \"hes got this warlike twinkle in his eyes,\" a person close to the Kremlin said. Russian howitzers being loaded onto train cars at a station outside Taganrog, Russia, days before the invasion. The New York Times Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said that amid Russias military buildup around Ukraine late last year, a deputy minister asked him if he knew what was going to happen. \"That means that no one has told the deputy minister,\" Mr. Markov said. \"Even some members\" of Russias security council \"werent told until the last moment.\" Many elites found out too late. Russias main industrial association had been expecting to meet with Mr. Putin in February. On the agenda, among other things: the regulation of cryptocurrencies. But the meeting kept getting rescheduled, until finally, on Feb. 22 or Feb. 23, the Kremlin notified participants of the date: Feb. 24, the day Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine. Andrey Melnichenko, a coal and fertilizer billionaire in that lobbying group, described how he woke up that day to the \"madness\" in Ukraine. But the meeting with Mr. Putin was still on, so a few hours later, he was at the Kremlin, as scheduled. In an anteroom, stunned tycoons were munching on sandwiches while awaiting the results of their coronavirus swabs to clear them to share Mr. Putins air. When Mr. Putin finally appeared, the television cameras were rolling. He told the assembled billionaires that he had no choice but to invade. Mr. Putin met with a group of Russian oligarchs at the Kremlin on Feb. 24. \"What happened, in my view, is irrational,\" said Mr. Melnichenko, describing his reaction to the invasion. \"It was shock.\" Another magnate recalled realizing too late that Mr. Putin was parading them in front of the television cameras, for all the world to see, for a carefully planned purpose. The point was \"specifically to tar everyone there,\" he said, \"to get everyone sanctioned.\" There was no going back. They, like the rest of Russia, were in this with Mr. Putin now. Sure enough, Mr. Melnichenko and all the other businessmen who appeared with Mr. Putin that day were hit with sanctions by the West in the months that followed.\n\nDate : 3/5/2022 From : pressa@fsb.ru The distribution of humanitarian aid to local residents was organized March 3-4 of this year in the city of Melitopol on Victory Square ATTENTION MEDIA!

In some cases, the agency even offered language to hide the source of the information: \"A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE POWER STRUCTURES OF RUSSIA!!!!\" The messages, drawn from tens of thousands of emails leaked from Russias largest state-owned media company and reviewed by The Times, show how at least one engine of the Russian war effort purred along smoothly: the nations propaganda machine. At times, Russias military and the F.S.B. directed coverage down to the video clips played and the time of publication. The emails, leaked from V.G.T.R.K., the state media giant that oversees some of Russias most-watched channels, portrayed Mr. Putins military as backed into a corner by NATO. Once the full invasion began, the machine downplayed Russian atrocities, bolstered conspiracy theories and tried to portray Ukrainian troops as abandoning their posts. (After the emails were released by a group that publishes hacked documents, The Times verified the documents by confirming identities, email addresses and broadcasts on the air.) Off camera, state media employees had little to no idea what was actually happening. A state television journalist said in an interview that as late as April, his Kremlin sources were still assuring him that the war would be over within days. A pro-Russian Ukrainian politician called for Mr. Zelensky to resign on a Russian state-run news channel. \"Tomorrow morning, therell be a statement,\" the journalist recalled one of his sources saying, only to be proved wrong the next day. \"It was really kind of weird.\" But while state broadcasters kept delivering upbeat assessments, Mr. Putin privately acknowledged that his military was struggling. During the meeting in March with Mr. Bennett of Israel when Mr. Putin conceded that the war would be \"much more difficult than we thought\" he returned to the theme that has become a fixation of his presidency: his place in Russian history. Ukraine recaptures the North Kyiv Kharkiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine Kherson CRIMEA Kyiv UKRAINE Areas of Russian control Areas of Russian control before invasion Reclaimed by Ukraine CRIMEA \"I wont be the Russian leader who stood by and did nothing,\" he told Mr. Bennett, according to two people familiar with the exchange. Once again, Mr. Putin seemed convinced that future generations of Russians could be threatened by the West. He had spent years preparing for precisely such a clash, devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to Russias military, supposedly to modernize it and strip out the corruption that had sapped it in the 1990s. But while Russia made significant headway, Western officials said, a culture of graft and fraud persisted under Mr. Putin that emphasized loyalty above honesty, or even skill. The result was a hodgepodge of elite troops and bedraggled conscripts, advanced tanks and battalions that were powerful only on paper. \"Everyone was stealing and lying. This was a Soviet, and now Russian, tradition,\" said Col. Vaidotas Malinionis, a retired Lithuanian commander who served in the Soviet military in the 1980s. Looking at satellite images of the army camp where he served, he said the old barracks and mess hall were still there, with no sign of modernization, and a few buildings had fallen down. \"There has been no evolution at all, only regression,\" he said. European, American and Ukrainian officials warned against underestimating Russia, saying it had improved after its muddled invasion of Georgia in 2008. The defense minister overhauled the armed forces, forcibly retired about 40,000 officers and tried to impose more transparency on where money went. \"He made a lot of enemies,\" said Dara Massicot, a RAND researcher who studies the Russian military. Then, in 2012, that minister in charge of dragging the military out of its post-Soviet dysfunction became embroiled in a corruption scandal himself. Mr. Putin replaced him with Sergei K. Shoigu, who had no military experience but was seen as someone who could smooth ruffled feathers. \"Russia drew a lot of lessons from the Georgia war and started to rebuild their armed forces, but they built a new Potemkin village,\" said Gintaras Bagdonas, the former head of Lithuanias military intelligence. Much of the modernization drive was \"just pokazukha,\" he said, using a Russian term for window-dressing. Contractors like Sergei Khrabrykh, a former Russian Army captain, were recruited into the stagecraft. He said he got a panicked call in 2016 from a deputy defense minister. A delegation of officials was scheduled to tour a training base of one of Russias premier tank units, the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, whose history dates to the victories of World War II. Billions of rubles had been allocated for the base, Mr. Khrabrykh said, but most of the money was gone and virtually none of the work had been done. He said the minister begged him to transform it into a modern-looking facility before the delegation arrived. \"They needed to be guided around the territory and shown that the Kantemirovskaya Division was the coolest,\" Mr. Khrabrykh said. He was given about $1.2 million and a month to do the job. As he toured the base, Mr. Khrabrykh was stunned by the dilapidation. The Ministry of Defense had hailed the tank division as a unit that would defend Moscow in case of a NATO invasion. But the barracks were unfinished, with debris strewn across the floors, large holes in the ceiling and half-built cinder-block walls, according to photos Mr. Khrabrykh and his colleagues took. A tangle of electrical wires hung from a skinny pole. \"Just about everything was destroyed,\" he said. The interior of a tank base building. Sergei Khrabrykh The same base after work was done to cover up its state. Sergei Khrabrykh Before the delegation arrived, Mr. Khrabrykh said, he quickly constructed cheap facades and hung banners, covered in pictures of tanks and boasting the army was \"stronger and sturdier year by year,\" to disguise the worst of the decay. On the tour, he said, the visitors were guided along a careful route through the best-looking part of the base and kept away from the bathrooms, which had not been repaired. After the invasion started, the Kantemirovskaya Division pressed into northeastern Ukraine, only to be ravaged by Ukrainian forces. Crews limped away with many of their tanks abandoned or destroyed. Russian prosecutors have pursued thousands of officers and others for corruption in recent years: One colonel was accused of embezzling money meant for vehicle batteries, another of fraud around mobile kitchens. The deputy chief of the general staff was charged with defrauding the state over radio gear, and a major general sentenced to prison in the case. In 2019, Russias chief military prosecutor said that more than 2,800 officers had been disciplined over corruption violations in the past year alone. After the invasion, American officials noticed that much of Russias equipment was poorly manufactured or in short supply. Tires on wheeled vehicles fell apart, stalling convoys, while soldiers resorted to crowdfunding for clothes, crutches and other basic supplies as the war wore on. But even more consequential than the corruption, officials and analysts said, were the ways Mr. Putin fundamentally misunderstood his own military. Russia had, in fact, spent 20 years getting ready for a radically different kind of war. It had not prepared its military to invade and occupy a country as big and powerful as Ukraine, officials and analysts said. Instead, Russia had largely organized its military to keep U.S. and NATO forces away by inflicting maximum damage from afar. Central to this strategy was a series of outposts Kaliningrad by the Baltic, Crimea in the Black Sea, and the Syrian port of Tartus on the Mediterranean to use long-range missiles to keep Western forces at bay. In the event of conflict, Russia intended to blind the enemy and destroy it from a distance, American officials said. But in this case, Russia did not crush Ukraine with weeks of missile strikes in advance. It marched in quickly with forces on the ground. Unlike its more limited campaigns in places like Syria or the big hypothetical war with NATO it had long planned for the invasion of Ukraine was simply \"not what the Russian military was designed to do,\" putting it in a position it was probably \"least prepared\" to deal with, said Clint Reach, a researcher at RAND. In other words, the Kremlin picked the \"stupidest\" of all potential military options by rushing forward and trying to take over Ukraine, said General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. Russia had not trained its infantry, air and artillery forces to work in concert, move quickly and then do it all again from a new location, officials said. It did not have a clear Plan B after the march on Kyiv failed, and commanders had long been afraid to report bad news to their bosses. Russian aims get smaller Throughout the summer, Russia makes incremental gains in the East.

The mounting failures drove a cadre of pro-Russian military bloggers to a boiling point. While still cheerleaders for the war, they began to openly criticize Russias performance. \"Ive been keeping quiet for a long time,\" the blogger Yuri Podolyaka said in May, after hundreds of soldiers died in a river crossing. \"Due to stupidity I emphasize, because of the stupidity of the Russian command at least one battalion tactical group was burned, possibly two.\" A Ukrainian soldier atop an abandoned Russian tank at a river crossing where hundreds of Russian soldiers died. Ivor Prickett for The New York Times The fury eventually reached Mr. Putin himself. On the sidelines of his marquee annual economic conference in St. Petersburg in June, the president held a meeting that had become a tradition: a sit-down with news media chiefs. This time, though, the bloggers were the headline guests. Mr. Putin sat alone at one end in a cavernous hall, according to one attendee, who provided a photo of the private gathering. Some of the bloggers took the floor and peppered Mr. Putin with messages and complaints from the front. \"It became a very concrete conversation, a surprising one for us,\" the person present said. \"Wed never had such conversations.\" It appeared to the person there that Russias intelligence agencies were using the bloggers to shift the blame for the wars failings to the Ministry of Defense. Mr. Zatulin, the Putin ally in Parliament, insisted he supported the war, but said a blame game has broken out, and took a side himself. \"Of course, to a certain degree, we now have an element of everyone wanting to dump the responsibility on someone else,\" Mr. Zatulin said. \"But I think that the main miscalculations,\" he added, \"were made by the Defense Ministry and the General Staff\" the militarys top brass.\n\nCollapsing Front\n\n\"Nobody is going to stay alive.\" Ruslan was 54 years old, at war in Ukraine, and seemed to be learning to use his weapon on the fly. Collapsing Front\n\n\"Nobody is going to stay alive.\" Ruslan was 54 years old, at war in Ukraine, and seemed to be learning to use his weapon on the fly.

With his marksmans rifle, bundle of papers and copies of his Russian passport in his pack, Ruslan was one of thousands of poorly trained, underequipped men asked to defend a huge swath of territory that Russia had seized in northeastern Ukraine. By summers end, Russian leaders had sent their best troops far to the south, leaving skeleton crews behind. So when the Ukrainians swept in and attacked the northeast, hoping to recapture occupied land, soldiers like Ruslan were cut down or melted away in a chaotic retreat. Military analysts had warned of such a danger before the invasion. Even as tens of thousands of Russian soldiers massed ominously along Ukraines borders, they said, the Kremlin had not sent enough to occupy the entire country. The Russian war plans for the 26th Tank Regiment signaled the same problem: Expect no reinforcements. Russia managed to take territory, frequently at enormous cost. But how to keep it was often an afterthought. \"The army, the generals, the soldiers werent ready,\" said Mr. Tsaryov, the man American officials identified as a puppet leader the Kremlin could install in Ukraine. A kindergarten classroom near Izium was used as a base by retreating Russian soldiers and emblazoned with the military symbol \"Z\" in September. Nicole Tung for The New York Times He said the Russian Army had spread itself so thin across Ukraine after invading that it \"would move through cities and not leave behind even a garrison, even a small one to stick up a Russian flag and defend it.\" In the northeastern region of Kharkiv, Russian commanders put men like Ruslan at roadblocks and moved on.

The rifle next to him suggested he was a sniper. But while snipers in modern militaries often go through weeks of additional special training, Ruslans teacher appeared to be the internet. \"Hello dear soldier!\" read the unsigned letter in his pack. \"You have to risk your life so that we can live peacefully. Thanks to you and your comrades our army remains so strong, mighty and can protect us from any enemy.\" More than 50 pages of Russian documents, collected from three towns in the Kharkiv region and reviewed by The Times, show a timeless truth: Foot soldiers bear the outsize burden of combat. The documents shared with three independent military experts, who considered them credible detail how Russia relied on bedraggled backup forces, many of them separatist fighters from Ukraines long conflict in its divided east, to hold territory as the regular Russian Army fought hundreds of miles away. The 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine was one of them. It had nearly 2,000 men, but was almost completely dependent on foot soldiers. More than a dozen pages of its rosters detail the particulars of the units suffering, down to a lack of warm clothing and boots. Several of its soldiers were in their 50s, including one who experienced \"cardiac failure,\" while one of its youngest casualties, a 20-year-old named Vladimir, endured \"frostbite of the lower limbs.\" Yet another complained on a phone call intercepted by the Ukrainians that he had no armored vest and a helmet from the 1940s. An excerpt from a roster of soldiers from the 202nd Rifle Regiment of the Luhansk Peoples Republic. \"Our battalion, for instance, has already gone more than three weeks without receiving ammunition from the army,\" the pro-Russian militia commander, Mr. Khodakovsky, said on Telegram in September. In an interview, another soldier described having only the vaguest sense of how to use his weapon. He recounted being advised to fire judiciously, one round at a time, rather than blasting his rifle uncontrollably. But he wasnt sure how to do that. So, shortly before going into combat, he said, he turned to a commander and asked how to switch his rifle off fully automatic. Russia came to rely on such battered, inexperienced troops after months of tactics that more closely resembled 1917 than 2022. Commanders sent waves of troops into the range of heavy artillery, eking out a few yards of territory at grievous tolls. When one Russian unit arrived in eastern Ukraine, it was quickly whittled down to a haggard few, according to one of its soldiers. During fighting in the spring, he said, his commanders ordered an offensive, promising artillery to support the attack. It never came, he said, and his unit was devastated. Yet commanders sent them right back into the melee all the same. \"How much time has passed now? Nine months, I think?\" he said. \"In this whole time, nothing has changed. They have not learned. They have not drawn any conclusions from their mistakes.\" He recounted another battle in which commanders sent soldiers down the same path to the front, over and over. On each trip, he said, bodies fell around him. Finally, after being ordered to go a fifth time, he and his unit refused to go, he said. In all, he said, his unit lost about 70 percent of its soldiers to death and injury, ruining any faith he had in his commanders. \"Nobody is going to stay alive,\" he said. \"One way or another, one weapon or another is going to kill you.\" American officials realized early on that they had vastly overestimated Russias military. The morale of rank-and-file soldiers was so low, the Americans said, that Russia began moving its generals to the front lines to shore it up. But the generals made a deadly mistake: They positioned themselves near antennas and communications arrays, making them easy to find, the Americans said. Ukraine started killing Russian generals, yet the risky Russian visits to the front lines continued. Finally, in late April, the Russian chief of the general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, made secret plans to go himself. American officials said they found out, but kept the information from the Ukrainians, worried they would strike. Killing General Gerasimov could sharply escalate the conflict, officials said, and while the Americans were committed to helping Ukraine, they didnt want to set off a war between the United States and Russia. The Ukrainians learned of the generals plans anyway, putting the Americans in a bind. After checking with the White House, senior American officials asked the Ukrainians to call off the attack. \"We told them not to do it,\" a senior American official said. \"We were like, Hey, thats too much.\" The message arrived too late. Ukrainian military officials told the Americans that they had already launched their attack on the general's position. Dozens of Russians were killed in the strike, officials said. General Gerasimov wasnt one of them. Russian military leaders scaled back their visits to the front after that.\n\nDivided Ranks\n\n\"Wagner almost always fights alone.\" They deployed tanks, heavy artillery and fighter jets.

To join in Mr. Putins war, he has recruited prisoners, trashed the Russian military and competed with it for weapons. More than 20 years into a murder sentence, Yevgeny Nuzhin saw his chance at salvation swoop in by helicopter. Mr. Prigozhin the close confidant of Mr. Putin, known for stirring up trouble across the Middle East and Africa with his mercenary army, Wagner came to Mr. Nuzhins prison south of Moscow in August, looking for recruits. Heaving with patriotic fervor, Mr. Prigozhin gave the kind of speech he has delivered at other Russian prisons in recent months, some shared online. In one, also from August, Mr. Prigozhin, dressed in a drab beige uniform, promised pardons for the inmates who made it back from Ukraine alive. Those who didnt, he said, would \"be buried in the alleys of the heroes.\" He also issued a warning: Anyone thinking of deserting his forces once in Ukraine, he said in the video, would be shot. Mr. Nuzhin accepted Mr. Prigozhins offer, but ignored the warning. After two days at the front, where he spent his time collecting the bodies of dead Wagner soldiers, he used the cover of darkness to slip away and surrender to Ukrainian troops. \"What good has Putin done in the time that he has been in power? Has he done anything good?\" Mr. Nuzhin told The Times after being taken into Ukrainian custody. \"I think this war is Putins grave.\" Yevgeny Nuzhin, 55, a Russian prisoner of war held by Ukraine, in October. Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times Mr. Putins reliance on mercenaries and convicts is one of the more unusual features of his war in Ukraine. Mr. Prigozhin is just one of a handful of strongmen active in the war, all of them managed by Mr. Putin, who has carved up the administration of much of Russia into competing fiefs run by people loyal to him above all. Beyond the mercenaries controlled by Mr. Prigozhin, who rose to prominence as a caterer of Kremlin events, there is also the Russian national guard, overseen by Mr. Putins former bodyguard. And there is the unit commanded by the Chechen leader, Mr. Kadyrov whose fighters were found and attacked because of their misadventures on TikTok. As far as officials can tell, the Russian military has limited coordination with any of them. \"There was no unified command, there was no single headquarters, there was no single concept and there was no unified planning of actions and command,\" said General Ivashov, the retired Russian officer who warned the war would go badly. \"It was destined to be a defeat.\" The splintered Russian forces have sparred openly. After Russian forces withdrew from northeast Ukraine in late summer, Mr. Kadyrov called for the Russian commander responsible to be demoted to private and shipped to the front, \"to wash his shame away with blood.\" Mr. Prigozhin weighed in, too: \"All these bastards should go with machine guns barefoot to the front.\" The public finger-pointing has added to a sense of disarray within the Russian war effort. Mr. Putin has replaced several top military commanders. Yet he has stuck with Mr. Shoigu, his defense minister, and with General Gerasimov, the chief of the militarys general staff, because firing them would amount to a public acknowledgment that the war is going badly, an admission Mr. Putin is loath to make, argued General Budanov, the Ukrainian military intelligence chief. \"They are still trying to maintain the illusion that everything is going well,\" he said. The friction has, at times, run all the way down to the troops in the battle zone. After a battlefield argument in the Zaporizhzhia region over the summer, a Russian tank commander drove his T-90 tank not at the enemy but toward a group of Russian national guard troops, firing at their checkpoint and blowing it up, said Fidar Khubaev, describing himself as Russian drone operator who witnessed the episode. \"Those types of things happen there,\" said Mr. Khubaev, adding that he fled Russia in the fall. Of all the supplementary armies charging into Ukraine, Mr. Prigozhins Wagner has become especially pivotal. Its troops have received glowing coverage on Russian state television, and in November they were profiled in a documentary film called \"Wagner: Contract with the Motherland\" produced by RT, one of the Kremlins primary propaganda outlets. \"Until recently, Wagner has been one of the most closed and secretive organizations, but for us they have made a huge exception,\" Andrey Yashchenko, the films presenter, says in the opening montage, which shows tanks rolling through rubble-strewn villages. In the first five months of the war, there was almost no public mention of Wagner or Mr. Prigozhins involvement in Ukraine. By late summer, as the Russian military began to collapse under Ukrainian campaigns in the northeast and south, Mr. Prigozhin stepped into the spotlight. After years of denying any links to Wagner and sometimes its very existence Mr. Prigozhin suddenly went public, making a show of visiting his troops in Ukraine, handing out medals, attending funerals and trumpeting his independence on the battlefield. Mr. Prigozhin attending a soldiers funeral on Sept. 23. v1.ru \"Wagner almost always fights alone,\" he said in an Oct. 14 post on the page of his catering company on VK, a Russian social media site. A Times analysis of videos in Ukraine found that Wagner troops are often showcasing some of Russias most advanced weaponry, including tanks, fighter aircraft and thermobaric rocket launchers. And because of his connection with the president, Mr. Prigozhin is given priority over other military units for arms and equipment, a senior European official said. Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied that Russias separate fighting forces were causing confusion or division, insisting they all report to Russias top military brass. The prominence of Mr. Prigozhin and Mr. Kadyrov, he said, was merely a function of their public-relations efforts. \"Some people are more active in the information space, some people are less active,\" Mr. Peskov said. \"But it doesnt signify any, lets say, independence.\" Despite its weaponry and bravado, Wagner has struggled on the battlefield. Some Ukrainian soldiers say it is a formidable foe. Yet for nearly six months, Wagners troops have been trying to seize the small industrial city of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region, and have been kept at bay by Ukrainian forces at great cost to both sides prompting a rare public acknowledgment of Ukraines fighting prowess. The frontline city of Bakhmut, where Wagner forces have fought for months. Tyler Hicks/The New York Times \"The situation is difficult but stable,\" Mr. Prigozhin said in the Oct. 14 post. \"The Ukrainians are offering dignified resistance. The legend about Ukrainians running away is just that, a legend. Ukrainians are guys with steel balls just like us. This isnt a bad thing. As Slavs, we should take pride in this.\" Hundreds of Wagner troops have been killed in the war, and several of the groups fighter jets have been downed. The convicts Mr. Prigozhin has recruited appear to be little more than cannon fodder and make up a vast majority of casualties among Wagner forces, according to an assessment by Ukraines military intelligence agency, which said in October that about 8,000 Wagner troops were fighting in Ukraine. Another former Russian inmate recruited by Mr. Prigozhin said he was left in a shallow trench at the front lines near Bakhmut for four days with no food or water and little sense of what he was supposed to be doing, other than dragging away the many bodies of his dead comrades. It was no wonder, he said, that some of Wagners recruits decided to flee. To keep control, Mr. Prigozhin has resorted to extreme punishment, showing how the war has whittled away the vestiges of rule of law in Russia. Like Mr. Putin, whose spies have been accused of poisoning and assassinating perceived traitors all over the world, Mr. Prigozhin has said that treachery is the worst sin any Russian can commit. He has proposed setting up his own Gestapo-like police force to hunt down the disloyal, including, he has said, Russian businessmen \"who leave our country in their business jets.\" The fate of Mr. Nuzhin serves as a grisly warning. Mindful of the pressures on prisoners of war and the risks they face, The Times has chosen to withhold their names. And, as with the other people we interviewed, we use documents and other evidence to vet their claims. In Mr. Nuzhins case, we did not publish our interview with him, but he also spoke to Ukrainian media, which broadcast portions of his account. Soon after, he was released in a prisoner swap and ended up back in the hands of Wagner. He then appeared in a video on a pro-Russian Telegram account. In it, Mr. Nuzhins head was taped to a block. Looming over him was a man in camouflage, holding a sledgehammer. \"I woke up in this basement, where I was told that I will be judged,\" Mr. Nuzhin says in the video, his voice dry and gravelly. The sledgehammer then swings down and crushes his skull. Shortly after, Mr. Prigozhin released a statement endorsing Mr. Nuzhins murder. \"Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed them consciously,\" the statement said. \"He planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.\" A day later, asked about the video on a conference call with journalists, Mr. Peskov said, \"Its not our business.\"",

                "cc_text": "A bad bromance? Implications of the war in Ukraine for China-Russia relations The start of the year heralded the emergence of a comprehensive partnership between China and Russia. However, Moscows invasion of Ukraine has increasingly made the future of this bilateral relationship unclear. Western administrations should now pay close attention to changes in various sectors if they are to profit from such uncertainty.\n\nAt the close of the recently concluded G20 meeting, Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious proposal that \"China can play a more important mediating role in the coming months.\" Chinas Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, and Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, also met at the summit and promised to \"release the full potential of China-Russia relations\". But what exactly does that entail? Ten months have passed since Vladimir Putins February escalation in Ukraine, and yet debates continue about the extent to which we can account for variation in the China-Russia relationship. But have there been any visible changes? And importantly, what might be the game changers that could upset the \"no limits\" partnership?\n\nDespite claims of neutrality, China has consistently aligned its public messaging around the war with Russias official narrative. China has vocally criticised western sanctions against Russia and continues to accuse NATO of both provoking and prolonging the conflict in Ukraine. Some pundits predicted that the war would create a rift between Beijing and Moscow, particularly as it became apparent that Putins goal of taking Kyiv within days would not be met. Unsurprisingly, this did not come to fruition. In the early stages of the war, in March, Wang Yi described the China-Russia partnership as \"rock solid\". Then, in September, Putin and Xi Jinping met in Uzbekistan and reaffirmed their support for each others core interests. Chinese officials without exception refuse to condemn Russian actions including the massacre at Bucha and the crisis at Zaporizhzhia, Europes largest nuclear power plant.\n\nAt the same time, Chinas support is qualified in that Beijing is aware of the costs that Russias war has on global supply chains, food security, nuclear proliferation, and a host of other issues that disrupt a stable international order which China largely benefits from. These challenges have placed Beijing in an uncomfortable position where it fundamentally does not want to see Putins regime collapse (especially given that they share a border of 2,615 miles), but equally finds the pursuit of its own interests hampered by Putins long war.\n\nAn increasingly unbalanced relationship\n\nPolitically, both China and Russia have constructed national identities and corresponding nationalisms based on very similar understandings of world history. They both harbour a common sense of past humiliation at the hands of the western powers, NATO and particularly the US. They both view December 26th 1991 the day of the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a lesson regarding the importance of maintaining national power, fighting western liberal thought, and strengthening regime authority. They both regard the \"colour revolutions\" of the 2000s as a prime example of western interference and subversion in sovereign countries. And they both proclaimed the common future of a \"just multipolar system of international relations\" in their joint statement on February 4th 2022. This declaration seemed to be the peak convergence of China and Russias visions of a changing world order.\n\nOn the economic front, since the February escalation, China and Russia have deepened ties. In the first nine months of 2022, China-Russia bilateral trade increased by 32 per cent to 136.09 billion US dollars. But some striking imbalances exist within this economic relationship: China is Russias largest trading partner, whereas Russia does not even rank amongst Chinas top ten. Roughly half of Russian exports to China are crude petroleum, whereas China exports manufactured goods to Russia which increasingly cannot be obtained due to severed trading ties with western countries. As such, Russia is rapidly finding itself in a peripheral position vis--vis China, a trend that was only sped up by the February escalation.\n\nSince then, Russias relationship with China has significantly changed, not only because the two partners worked out a relationship to bypass international SWIFT payments, but also because Chinese businesses have reorganised themselves into smaller companies. The second measure was Beijings attempt to shield Chinese companies from possible secondary western sanctions. That said, in the first seven months since the February escalation, approximately 19,500 new Chinese corporations were established listing \"Russia\" on their trade licences.\n\nBut there are certainly limits to China and Russias economic ties. The war has likely reinforced a growing sentiment amongst Beijings leadership that its future prosperity should not depend upon relationships with other powers, and that across all boards it should seek to engineer a greater degree of economic self-reliance. China may increasingly look to the Global South for partnerships rather than investing heavily in its great power relations including with Russia. The slogan \"new type of great power relations\" was notably dropped from Xis 20th Party Congress report. Russia isolated itself from international markets, and China is determined not to fall into the same trap.\n\nA new era of defence cooperation?\n\nIn the security domain, some observers were concerned that the war would usher in a new era of alignment between China and Russia, characterised by growing military and defence cooperation. However, when adopting a longer-term perspective, there seems to be more continuity than change in the China-Russia relationship since the start of the war.\n\nMoscow and Beijing certainly have a long and relatively close relationship in the defence-industrial and military domains. In the 1990s and 2000s, China was the largest customer regarding Russias defence industry, supporting the sectors transition after the collapse of the Soviet Union. At its peak in 2005, China accounted for around 60 per cent of all Russian deliveries of major weapons. As China aimed for more self-sufficiency in defence-industrial development and Chinese systems moved up the value chain, procurement shifted from complete systems towards individual components such as Russian jet engines. By the 2010s, Chinas share of Russian arms exports had plummeted to about ten per cent after having dropped to below 25 per cent between 2007 to 2009.\n\nNonetheless, as procurement evolved, Chinas Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) decided to strengthen cooperation with its Russian counterpart. Building on frequent bilateral exchanges, the PLA has closely studied Russias post-2008 \"New Look\" military reform, elements of which informed the PLAs modernisation and restructuring under Xi Jinping over the past decade. Since 2003, China and Russia have further jointly participated in at least 78 military exercises, with more than half taking place since 2016. From initial counterterrorism exercises, both countries have begun to hold joint drills outside their immediate neighbourhood, conducting naval drills and exercises in the Mediterranean and even off the coast of South Africa.\n\nMilitary exercises have obvious benefits for Russia and China. Apart from being used as a confidence building measure to de-securitise their extensive joint border, military drills also signal resolve to the US and its allies. This has continued over the past six months, as seen in a joint Chinese and Russian aviation drill near Japan in May and Chinas participation in Russias Vostok 2022 exercise in September.\n\nFor the PLA, these exercises have also presented a useful opportunity to enhance readiness and simulate operational experience. As a military that has not fought a war since a border skirmish with Vietnam in 1979, the PLA is thus certainly watching the performance of Russias armed forces in Ukraine closely.\n\nAs is the case for the broader diplomatic and economic relationship, military cooperation increasingly mirrors Chinas status as the more senior partner in the bilateral relationship. This can be seen in the growing use of Chinese equipment in bilateral military exercises and the structural shift in defence-industrial ties. The Russo-Ukrainian War has not yet visibly changed these dynamics but may further signal Russias miliary and defence-industrial decline relative to China, as seen in the obvious shortcomings of Russian logistics and maintenance. Furthermore, Russian military equipments lack of performance on the Ukrainian battlefield may accelerate Chinas move away from obtaining Russian military goods, but that is something to watch out for in the medium term as military procurement notoriously takes a long time.\n\nThe transatlantic alliance should closely monitor security cooperation between Moscow and Beijing to understand whether Russias distress heralds a closer alignment between the two powers. Washington and Brussels must clearly signal red lines to Beijing, including, for instance, the potential for China to supply advanced military equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles to Russia. Deterrence can only be effective with clear communication.\n\nAdditional pieces of the Sino-Russian jigsaw\n\nTwo important actors that could impact substantially on the Sino-Russian relationship include Ukraine and India. With regards to Kyiv, Beijings relationship with the beleaguered state is frequently overlooked by analysts who attempt to understand Sino-Russian relations. Before the February escalation, China and Ukraine shared a fairly good relationship and Beijing was an important economic partner of Ukraine. Geoeconomically speaking, Ukraine is strategically situated on the map of the Belt and Road Initiative, which is why Ukraine presented itself as Chinas \"bridge to Europe\".\n\nThe relationship between Beijing and Kyiv may become frosty as influential Ukrainians like Oleksandr Merezhko, chairman of the Ukrainian Parliaments Foreign Affairs Committee, increasingly perceive China as siding with the enemy rather than being \"neutral\". Should this perception deepen, this may throw a spanner in the works regarding Macrons suggestion at the recent G20 Summit that China should play mediator, as such a role may be unacceptable to Kyiv. Still, China remains Ukraines largest trading partner, which makes it hard for Kyiv to simply go cold turkey, especially in light of the dire economic situation that looms over the country. Slowly but surely, Taiwan is however starting to step in to support Ukraine, and it could play a vital role in helping the country with reconstruction.\n\nAs for Russia-India relations, the triangular relationship between New Delhi, Beijing and Moscow could potentially shift, with major implications for the global system. Thus far, New Delhi has remained neutral on the Russo-Ukrainian War. This is despite Russias imperialist actions and atrocities in Ukraine and Indias experiences with colonialism. An important factor holding back a punitive response from India is the fact that Russia continues to be its most important military supplier. Between 2017 to 2021, India imported 46 per cent of its total arms from Russia. The heavy dependence on Russian arms means, for some time to come, that Moscow will continue to carry weight in New Delhi.\n\nHaving steady arms supplies is important for India, especially given its ongoing border dispute with its main rival China, with whom it shares a 2,167 mile border. That said, Indian policy makers were becoming increasingly concerned about the cosy relationship developing between Russia and China even before the February escalation. If the perception grows that Moscow has become too beholden to Beijing, it will certainly jeopardise Russia-India relations, with major impacts on Russias economy. Between 2018 and 2021 alone, India spent a whopping 5.51 billion US dollars on Russian arms, making it the worlds biggest buyer of Russian weapons. The Kremlin will have to tread carefully as Russia suffers from a lack of credibility in India. Six decades ago, the Soviet Union led by Russia, chose Beijings side during the Sino-Indian War. In the face of closer Russia-China relations, or in a border dispute between India and China where Russia sides with its rival, India may change its stance and play a more active role in multilateral organisations such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the US) and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) that may be more favourable to Ukraines interests rather than those of Russia.\n\nOther game changers\n\nCourse correction in diplomacy often takes a long time. Still, there are several game changers that may alter Beijings relationship with Moscow. One exigency that could change Chinas approach towards Russia is the potential use of nuclear weapons. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz returned from his recent visit to Beijing claiming that he and Xi Jinping had \"reached an understanding that there can be no escalation through the use of tactical nuclear weapons\". The Chinese readout of the meeting was less forthcoming, but does mention that both parties \"exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis\" and opposed the threat or use of nuclear weapons. When Biden met Xi on November 14th, both parties agreed that a nuclear war should \"never be fought\".\n\nSecondly, given that the Russo-Ukrainian War is continuing much longer than expected, combined with western responses to it, China may have to recalculate the expected returns of its partnership with Russia. Chinas economic cooperation with the US and EU remains far more important than its relationship with Russia. Last year, 17.2 per cent 521 billion US dollars of Chinas total exports went to the US, more than any other destination in the world. China was also the third largest exporter of goods to the EU (10.2 per cent) and the largest importer of EU goods (22.4 per cent).\n\nBoth China and Russia overestimated the divisions between the US and Europe over the Russo-Ukrainian War. In reality, their differences are much smaller than expected, and transatlantic unity ensured a rapid and strong response by virtue of sanctions against Russia and NATO support for Ukraine. Over the last few months, Beijings language of being \"very aloof and elusive\" became much more moderate.\n\nFinally, in the event of a putsch in Moscow, or if Russia is to suffer the most compelling military defeat in Europe since the Second World War, the extent to which China and Russias futures can continue to closely align may fall into question. A defeated Putin would become less valuable as a confidant in the \"China story\".\n\nSpeaking Chinas language\n\nThese weak points in the Sino-Russian partnership have to some extent moderated the shared vision set out on February 4th. China and Russia will continue to blame NATO for escalating tensions in the region and starting the war, and this common ground is unlikely to disappear. But when 2022 is written into Chinas history books, Russias \"special military operation\" will likely be a side-story not the main event. As the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) begins the challenge of finally reopening the country after COVID-19; tinkering with the stalled engine of its economic growth model; and charting the path towards its two centenary goals; it has its own battles to fight.\n\nAppeals from American and European security actors for China to pick a side can and will not work. The US, Germany, France and the UK should instead communicate with China by referencing Beijings own diplomatic concepts. Both the global development and security initiatives recently proposed by Xi Jinping are couched in the ambitious rhetoric of sustainability and global stability, framing devices that the US and EU can deploy to remind China of its responsibilities as a major stakeholder in the global order. Engaging Beijing in the context of its close relationship with Moscow in a meaningful way will not be an easy task. Yet, reiterating joint commitments such as avoiding nuclear war contributes to at least finding a common language if not position on the wars worst potential outcome, one that China certainly wants to avoid.\n\nLukas Fiala is a PhD International Relations candidate at the London School of Economics and the Project Coordinator of China Foresight at LSE IDEAS.

The Russian leaders trip will be his first to Minsk since 2019, and comes as he has been taking a more public role in his war in Ukraine. Lukashenko personally meets Putin at the airport in Minsk.\n\nPutin visited Belarus for the first time since June 2019.\n\nPresumably, he arrived to persuade Lukashenko about direct involvement in the war pic.twitter.com/jSW6EN8vIz Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) December 19, 2022 Lukashenko has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight, at times even subtly criticising the invasion, saying he felt the conflict was \"dragging on\". Speaking to Russian news agencies, the Kremlins spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Belarus was Russias \"number one ally\", but that suggestions that Moscow wanted to pressure Minsk into joining what it calls its \"special military operation\" were \"stupid and unfounded fabrications\".\n\nUpdated at 08.14 EST\n\n19 Dec 2022 13.45 EST Vladimir Putin has described Russian-Belarusian talks in Minsk as \"very productive\" after his one-on-one meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, Belarusian state media reported. Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with his Belarusian counterpart, Putin insisted that Russia has no interest in \"absorbing\" anyone, and that unspecified \"enemies\" wanted to stop Russias integration with Belarus. The future of Belarusian and Russian peoples \"is being determined now\", Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta cited President Lukashenko as saying. He added: Today we can unequivocally state: together we were able not only to survive, but also to find opportunities for the development of our economies. He said negotiations of the two leaders with larger government delegations in Minsk had been productive, and said they discussed \"the entire range of matters concerning Belarusian-Russian relations\", according to Belta.\n\n19 Dec 2022 13.20 EST UN chief believes war in Ukraine will go on The UNs secretary general, Antnio Guterres, said he believes Russias war in Ukraine \"will go on\" and does not see a prospect for \"serious\" peace talks in the immediate future. Speaking to reporters during his annual end-of-year conference in New York, Guterres said he \"will not relent in the pursuit of peace in Ukraine in line with international law and the United Nations Charter\", referring to the UN charters key principle of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. He said he was \"not optimistic\" about the possibility of effective Ukraine and Russia peace talks in the immediate future, adding: I do believe that the military confrontation will go on. Nevertheless, he said he \"strongly hoped that peace could be reached in 2023, citing the \"consequences\" for Ukraines people, Russian society and the global economy if a deal is not found. He added: All these are reasons for us to do everything possible to make a peace solution happen before the end of 2023. In the meantime, he said he would focus on increasing the efficiency of a UN-brokered deal that resumed Ukraines Black Sea food and fertiliser shipments, continue to try to restart the export of Russian ammonia via Ukraine and seek to accelerate the exchange of prisoners of war.\n\n19 Dec 2022 13.00 EST Here are some of the latest images we have received from Minsk, where Russias president Vladimir Putin has been holding talks with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko.

Russia still aims to secure a land corridor through Ukraine to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, Musteata told the TVR-Moldova television channel, as reported by Reuters. Musteata said: The question is not whether the Russian Federation will undertake a new advance towards Moldovas territory, but when it will do so. He said his agency believed Moscow was looking at several scenarios to reach Moldova and that it was possible an offensive would be launched in January-February or later in March-April. Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot, borders western Ukraine. Musteata said Russia wanted its forces to link up with those forces in Transnistria.\n\nUpdated at 13.24 EST\n\n19 Dec 2022 12.28 EST Dan Sabbagh Boris Johnsons Ukraine policy may not have always been sophisticated \"Dobryi den, everybody!\" but his enthusiasm was welcomed in Kyiv. Six months of Conservative party chaos later, his successor but one, Rishi Sunak, is yet to demonstrate he is as supportive at a time when Ukraine needs the west to dig in. A leak at the start of the weekend said that Sunak had ordered an internal assessment of the significance of British military aid to Ukraine. Revelation of the Whitehall exercise was accompanied by a pointed briefing to the BBC, accusing the prime minister of resorting to a \"Goldman Sachs dashboard\" approach. Rishi Sunak speaks to the media during the joint expeditionary force summit in Riga, Latvia on Monday 19 December. Photograph: WPA/Getty Images \"Wars arent won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct,\" the critic continued a demonstration that cracks are appearing in Britains policy towards Ukraine. Downing Street may have rejected that characterisation on Monday, but a Ukraine review is on. \"The PM is staying closely across the detail of developments in Ukraine and the impact of UK and international support,\" a spokesperson said. \"To ensure we are delivering the best possible assistance.\" It is also no secret in Westminster that Sunak and his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are not close. Wallace has been the ever present in Britains Ukraine policy, but also a long-term supporter of Johnson who then backed the ill-fated Liz Truss and flirted with backing Johnson in an unlikely comeback against Sunak.

Ministers agreed to trigger a cap if prices on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas hubs front-month contract exceed 180 (157) per megawatt hour for three days. Polands prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the deal \"means the end of market manipulation\" by Russia and its energy giant Gazprom.

Tsikhanouskayas remarks came as Vladimir Putin travelled to Belarus for talks with Alexander Lukashenko, a meeting that the Belarusian president said would cover the \"military-political situation\" in the region as well as economic cooperation. Ukraine will be closely monitoring the talks. Last week, several Ukrainian military commanders said Russia might try another attempt at invading the country from the north. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Ukraine was ready for \"all possible defence scenarios\" against Moscow and its ally. Kyiv was \"right to prepare\" for Minsk to join Moscows new offensive because the probability \"might increase in coming weeks\", Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Kyiv Post. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian exiled opposition leader. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images She said: Belarusian armed forces are part of the society and share the same view on the war 86% of Belarusians are against participation in the war. This has stopped the order to send Belarusian troops to the battlefield in Ukraine. It was not a good will of dictators or Lukashenkos standing up to Putin he is fully on the Kremlins side. However, the probability of such an order remains and might increase in coming weeks. I think the Ukrainian leadership is right to prepare for this scenario even though it means distracting significant forces from active war zones in the south-east. Lukashenko \"sees Ukraine as a threat\", she said, adding that \"a democratic, free, European Ukraine is a bad example to the dictatorships of Lukashenko and Putin, therefore this war is a logical decision for them.\" Asked what Russia and Belarus join aim might be, she replied: To destroy Ukraine, its European aspirations and national identity, and bring it under their control.\n\nUpdated at 11.56 EST",

                "cc_text": "WASHINGTON -- In a wartime address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged lawmakers and all Americans to continue supporting his country with military and financial aid as it fights for its existence against a revanchist Russia, warning that anything short of victory would threaten the free world, including the United States.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nDuring his 22-minute speech from the podium of the House of Representatives on December 21, Zelenskiy stressed that Ukraine can win the war against a better-armed Russian Army, but said U.S. military and financial aid was \"crucial\" to achieving final victory.\n\nAs he asked for more aid, Zelenskiy sought to hammer home to the American people that a war being fought thousands of miles away in towns they never heard of concerned them directly. He stressed that global freedom and democracy as well as U.S. security were at stake in Ukraine and compared war with Russia to the U.S. War of Independence.\n\nUkraine's defense \"is not only for life, freedom, and the security of Ukrainians. It will define whether [there] will be democracy for Ukrainians and for Americans,\" Zelenskiy, dressed in his signature, military-style olive-green sweater and trousers, said in English.\n\nThe war \"cannot be frozen or postponed, it cannot be ignored, hoping that the ocean or something else will provide protection.\"\n\nZelenskiy returned to Ukraine on December 22, his spokesman told AFP. Serhiy Nykyforov also confirmed that Zelenskiy had made a brief stop in Poland to meet with President Andrzej Duda.\n\nZelenskiy thanked Duda for the strong support of Ukrainians shown by the people of Poland. The office of the president said the two leaders discussed strategic plans for the future, bilateral relations, and cooperation at the international level in the coming year.\n\nZelenskiy's trip to the United States came as Congress prepared to vote on a sweeping spending bill that includes a provision to allocate an estimated $45 billion in additional military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe Senate on December 22 passed the massive $1.7 trillion spending bill, which includes about $772.5 billion for domestic programs and $858 billion for defense. The bill passed by a vote of 68-29 and now goes to the House of Representatives for a final vote before it can be sent to Biden to be signed into law.\n\nWhile the bill is expected to pass, U.S. support for Ukraine has waned as the 10-month war drags on and as Americans feel the pinch from high inflation.\n\nMany members of the Republican Party, which will take control of the House in January, have criticized massive aid to Ukraine at a time when the U.S. economy is suffering and also questioned how the aid is being used. Meanwhile, some members of the Democratic Party have expressed concern that growing military aid to Ukraine will provoke Russia.\n\nZelenskiy sought to address those concerns head-on, saying U.S. aid was not \"charity\" but rather \"an investment in global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\"\n\nZelenskiy told Congress that he had presented Biden with a 10-point peace plan but did not disclose its contents. The announcement of such a peace plan could soothe those members of Congress who had been calling for more diplomacy and less aid.\n\nHe also said that Iran -- which the United States has labeled a terrorist state -- had essentially allied with Russia in its war against his country, selling hundreds of deadly kamikaze drones to Moscow.\n\n\"That is how one terrorist has found the other,\" he said, a reference to Ukraines designation of Russia as a terrorist state as well.\n\n\"It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now,\" he said.\n\nThe Kremlin warned that the introduction of advanced U.S. weapons into the battlefield will hurt not enhance, the chances of bringing the conflict to an end.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in Moscow on December 22 that the weapons \"cannot prevent the Russian Federation from achieving its goals during the special military operation,\" the term Russia has forced local media to use when describing the conflict.\n\nZelenskiy's visit to Washington came a day after his trip to Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine at the heart of the war.\n\nRussia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, shelling the city nonstop and throwing wave after wave of soldiers into the fight.\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut would allow Russia to disrupt Ukraine's supply lines but also open the door for a future offensive on two bigger Ukrainian cities with more industry and rail access.\n\nIn his address, Zelenskiy compared the heroism of Ukrainian soldiers defending Bakhmut to that shown by U.S. troops fighting Adolf Hitler's military in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, also during the Christmas season.\n\n\"Bakhmut stands,\" Zelenskiy said to cheers. \"Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender.\"\n\nHe also compared the fighting in Bakhmut to the Battle of Saratoga during the U.S. War of Independence. The Americans won that battle against the English, turning the tide of the war.\n\nZelenskiy said \"more cannons and shells are needed\" to drive the Russians from Bakhmut and open a path to Ukraine's final victory.\n\n\"Your support is crucial, not just to stand in such a fight, but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.\n\nWATCH: Ukraine is preparing for the possibility of a new, large-scale offensive by Russian forces early in the new year. Russia continues to amass troops in neighboring Belarus, a country that Moscow has used as a launching ground to attack Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy did not directly ask Congress during his address for Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets, or the long-range, guided missiles known as ATACMS. Ukraines military has been seeking those weapons for months but the Biden administration has refused as of yet to give the green light.\n\nZelenskiy though indirectly hinted at the desire for fighter jets during his address, saying Ukraine doesnt need U.S. troops on the ground because his soldiers can \"perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves.\"\n\nZelenskiy concluded his speech by thanking both parties of Congress and the American people for their support of Ukraine.\n\nElise Giuliano, a professor of political science at Columbia Universitys Harriman Institute for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies, told RFE/RL that Zelenskiy was effective in communicating to Americans.\n\n\"He is appealing to our interest in protecting democracy but also in our own security,\" she said. He is \"also looking for those points of commonality\" between the two countries.\n\nGiuliano said that it was wise of Zelenskiy to highlight Irans support for Russia because many Americans readily identify Tehran as a \"bad\" and \"aggressive\" actor that the United States needs to \"stand up to.\" .\n\nZelenskiy had arrived in the U.S. capital earlier in the day on his first trip abroad since the start of Russia's invasion 10 months ago.\n\nHe held a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House to discuss aid and the course of the war before holding talks with Congressional leaders from both parties.\n\nBiden announced a new $1.85 billion security assistance package for Ukraine that includes a Patriot air defense battery.\n\nUkrainian leaders have pleaded for the Patriots to be provided, and Zelenskiy said during a news conference with Biden that he would likely ask for more. Ukraine needs them to prevent the destruction of the country's civilian infrastructure, including loss of electricity and heat in the cold winter months",

The 67-year-old has been the target of intensive criticism from hawkish commentators, who have accused him of being too cautious.\n\nAir Force general Sergei Surovikin - who was appointed as Russia's commander in Ukraine in October - was also present at the meeting, photos released by state media showed.\n\nUkrainian forces have made a series of major advances in recent months, including retaking Kherson - the only regional capital captured by Russian forces so far.\n\nAnd the collapse of Moscow's forces in eastern Ukraine earlier this year saw military bosses come in for sustained criticism from pro-Kremlin media figures.\n\nEPA\n\nThere had been reports that Armed Forces Chief Valeriy Gerasimov (R) had been dismissed\n\nThe meeting followed claims by the commander of Ukraine's military, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, that Moscow could seek to launch a new offensive in early 2023. He warned that Russia was preparing around 200,000 troops for the attack.\n\n\"I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv,\" he added. \"I know how many combat units I have right now, how many combat units I have to create by the end of the year - and, most importantly, not to touch them in any way now. No matter how hard it is.\"\n\nHe added that the attack could originate \"in the direction of Kyiv\" and may be launched from Belarus.\n\nIn February, Russian troops advanced towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv after crossing the border from Belarus.\n\nWhile the country's leader Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that his forces will join in the invasion, thousands of Russian troops are currently in the country taking part in what Moscow's defence ministry called \"intensive combat training\".\n\nMr Putin will visit his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk on Monday.\n\nBut analysts have questioned Russia's ability to launch a new offensive on the Ukrainian capital, and White House spokesperson John Kirby said that US intelligence officials \"aren't seeing any indication that there's an imminent move on Kyiv\".\n\nSenior US defence officials told Reuters news agency that Russia had been forced to use decades-old ammunition with high failure rates as it burns through its supplies.\n\nThey added that \"the rate of fire that Russia has been using its artillery and rocket ammunition\" could see them run out of reliable munitions by early 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that power had been restored to nearly six million people after the latest wave of Russian strikes to hit the country's energy grid.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the city's metro system had restarted and the water supply had been restored.\n\nHe also posted photos on Telegram of a large Christmas tree that has been adapted to meet the constraints of a wartime winter. The tree will be lit with energy-saving bulbs run off a generator, he said.\n\nPower has also been restored in the country's second city of Kharkiv, authorities said, after it was left without electricity for hours following Friday's wave of strikes that targeted energy stations across the country.\n\nRussia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones since the wave of strikes on power infrastructure began on 10 October. International leaders - including French President Emmanuel Macron - have said the strikes amount to a war crime.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence says there had been an \"uptick\" in Russia's campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent days.\n\nGetty Images",

                "cc_text": "December 17, 5:30 pm ET\n\nClick here to see ISWs interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report.\n\nThe Kremlin is likely attempting to depict Russian President Vladimir Putin as a competent wartime leader and to rehabilitate the image of the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) by publicizing Putins meeting with the joint headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces. The Kremlin announced on December 17 that Putin worked at the joint headquarters of the services of the Russian Armed Forces throughout the day, heard reports on the progress of the \"Special Military Operation\" in Ukraine, and held a meeting with the joint headquarters and a separate meeting with commanders.[1] The Russian MoD and media published footage of the meeting with the joint headquarters that showed that Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Army General Valery Gerasimov, Russian Defense Minister Army General Sergei Shoigu, and the Commander of the Joint Group of Forces in Ukraine Army General Sergei Surovikin were in attendance.[2] Images and video of the event provided by the Russian MoD preclude the identification of other notable officers (such as military district or army commanders) present, however. The Kremlin likely publicized the meeting to present Putin as being thoroughly engaged with the planning and execution of the war in Ukraine following recent prominent criticism of his role in leading the war effort by figures in the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.[3] One prominent milblogger even questioned whether \"Putin finally showed public interest in the special military operation\" at their suggestion to do so.[4]\n\nThe Kremlin also likely publicized Putins meeting with the joint headquarters to rehabilitate the image of the Russian MoD in response to the pro-war communitys routine criticism of the Russian MoD. The Kremlin likely consciously publicized Gerasimovs, Shoigus, and Surovikins attendance at the meeting with Putin to present the Russian MoD as an organized, unified, and effective war-fighting institution and to shield the top commanders of the Russian Armed Forces from further criticism. The Russian MoD has taken great care in the past months to affirm Gerasimovs continued role as Chief of the General Staff for a similar reason- in the absence of tangible Russian victories against Ukraine, Russian military leadership seeks to present a picture of a functional and seamless chain of military command.[5] The Kremlin is likely attempting to rehabilitate the image of the Russian MoD to counterbalance the growing influence of pro-war ultra-nationalist figures, primarily that of Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner Group Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, and their parallel military structures. The Kremlin will likely continue to attempt to shield the Russian MoD from criticism while still facilitating the growing influence of these ultra-nationalist pro-war figures. This effort is unsustainable and will likely continue to generate conflict between the Russian MoD and the ultra-nationalist pro-war community.\n\nThe Kremlin likely aims to portray Putin as a leader in touch with the Russian people by publicizing Putins participation in meaningless events like the grand opening of a turkey farm. Independent Russian news outlet The Moscow Times reported that the Kremlin has instructed leaders of certain state-owned corporations and regional governors to prepare a \"positive agenda\" of news and events in which Putin can participate.[6] The Moscow Times noted that Putins calendar already includes small events, such as the grand opening of a turkey breeding center, commemorating the anniversaries of state corporations, and reopening a repaired highway.[7] The Moscow Times cited Kremlin officials who said that the social well-being of the Russian people is declining while war fatigue is growing and that Putin needs to be seen as a \"herald of good news.\"[8] Such efforts likely aim to remind the Russian people that Putin is not just a military leader in wartime but also a civilian leader with close ties to the people. However, amplifying pithy events while canceling opportunities for the public to meaningfully engage with Putin on the state of the war and the country will not likely meaningfully improve Putins image, and, as ISW previously assessed, may undermine Putins populist appeal.[9] Russian pro-war nationalists have recently criticized the Russian MoD for similar performative messaging that ignores Russias wartime realities by branding the MoD with the epithet \"Russian Ministry of Camouflage Selfies,\" as ISW has previously reported.[10]\n\nA New York Times (NYT) investigation of Russian military documents supports ISWs longstanding assessments about how flawed Russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued Russias invasion of Ukraine from its onset. ISW has long assessed that faulty Russian planning assumptions, campaign design decisions, and Russian violations of Russias own military doctrine undermined Russian operations. The NYT acquired and published logbooks, timetables, orders, and other documents of elements of the 76th Airborne Division and 1st Guards Tank Army related to the early days of the war on December 16.[11] The documents demonstrate that Russian military planners expected Russian units to be able to capture significant Ukrainian territory with little to no Ukrainian military opposition. The documents indicate that elements of the 76th Airborne Division and Eastern Military District were ordered to depart Belarus and reach Kyiv within 18 hours against little resistance; Russian planners placed OMON riot police and SOBR Russian National Guard (Rosgvardia) special police elements (essentially a Russian SWAT equivalent) within the first column of a maneuver element of the 104th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th Airborne Division.[12] Riot police are not suitable lead elements for a large maneuver force in a conventional force-on-force war because they are not trained to conduct combined arms or mechanized warfare. The decision to place riot police in the lead column is a violation of Russian (or any normal) doctrine and indicates that Russian planners did not expect significant organized Ukrainian resistance. A separate set of orders indicates that Russian planners expected unsupported elements of the Russian 26th Tank Regiment (of the 47th Tank Division, 1st Guards Tank Army) to conduct a mostly uninhibited, 24-hour dash from Ukraines border with Russia to a point across the Dnipro River, about 400 kilometers away.[13] Ukrainian forces destroyed elements of the 26th Tank Regiment in Kharkiv Oblast, hundreds of kilometers short of its intended destination on March 17.[14]\n\nThe NYT investigation also supports ISWs assessments that Russian strategic commanders have been micromanaging operational commanders' decisions on tactical matters and that Russian morale is very low. The investigation supported existing reporting that Russian soldiers in Belarus did not know they were going to attack Ukraine until February 23the day before the invasionand that some soldiers did not know about the invasion until one hour before the invasion began.[15] A retired Russian general told the NYT that the lack of a unified Russian theater command meant there was \"no unified planning of actions and command [and control].\"[16] A Ukrainian pilot told the NYT he was amazed that Russian forces did not conduct a proper air and missile campaign at the beginning of the war to target Ukrainian airfieldsas Russian doctrine prescribes. The NYT reported a Russian tank commander deliberately destroyed a Rosgvardia checkpoint in Zaporizhia Oblast over an argument and that many Russian soldiers sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid combat.[17] The NYT's findings support ISWs assessments and body of research on why the Russian military has been experiencing significant failures since the beginning of the invasion.\n\nOngoing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut are further driving a wedge between forces of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) and Yevgeny Prigozhins Wagner Group troops. DNR Head Denis Pushilin claimed on December 17 that both DNR and Wagner units are closing the \"pincers\" on Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut.[18] Several milbloggers responded to Pushilins claim and categorically denied that DNR troops have anything to do with fighting in Bakhmut, emphasizing that offensive efforts in this area are exclusively led by the Wagner Group.[19] The disparities between Pushilins claims, which represent the official DNR line, and statements made by Prigozhin and other prominent voices in the Russian information space suggest that there is a continued and growing divide between the DNR and the Wagner Group. During battles for settlements south of Bakhmut in October, Prigozhin denied any involvement by DNR or conventional Russian troops in the capture of Ivanhrad.[20] Prigozhin has also previously been remarkably clear-eyed about the slow and grinding pace of Wagner advances in the Bakhmut area, which directly contrasts with exaggerated claims made by Pushilin and other Russian sources.[21] Wagners role in operations around Bakhmut will likely continue to contribute to divides between various factions in the Russian military and discredit DNR authorities and the forces that they command.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assesses that the Kremlin is not serious about negotiations with Ukraine, agreeing with a longstanding ISW assessment. CIA Director William Burns told PBS NewsHour on December 16, \"Most conflicts end in negotiations, but that requires a seriousness on the part of the Russians in this instance that I don't think we see... it's not our assessment that the Russians are serious at this point about a real negotiation.\"[22] ISW has consistently assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in negotiating seriously with Ukraine and retains maximalist objectives for the war.[23]\n\nPutin has consistently weaponized invocations of the negotiation process to isolate Ukraine from partner support. Putin has routinely framed Ukraine as refusing concessions and likely seeks to use any ceasefire and negotiation window to allow Russian troops time to reconstitute and relaunch operations, thus depriving Ukraine of the initiative. A ceasefire agreement that occurs soon enough to allow Russian forces to rest and refit this winter is extremely unlikely. Russia and Ukraine are currently opposed to one another on the terms of any such agreement, and it is highly unlikely that Russian and Ukrainian officials will agree to a ceasefire, let alone implement one, for some months. Russian forces will likely not have the opportunity to pause Ukrainian winter counter-offensives and reset before spring.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Kremlin is likely attempting to increase perceptions of Putins competence and of that of the Russian Ministry of Defense by publicizing Putins meeting with the joint headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces and Putins appearances at non-military events.\n\nA New York Times investigation of Russian military documents from early in the war supports ISWs longstanding assessments about how flawed Russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued Russias invasion of Ukraine from its onset.\n\nOngoing Russian offensive operations around Bakhmut are further driving a wedge between forces of the Donetsk Peoples Republic and Yevgeny Prigozhins Wagner Group troops.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency assesses that the Kremlin is not serious about negotiations with Ukraine, agreeing with a longstanding ISW assessment.\n\nUkrainian forces conducted counterattacks near Svatove and Kreminna and continue to strike Russian rear areas.\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations near Bakhmut and Avdiivka-Donetsk City.\n\nUkrainian officials warned that Russian forces may be attempting to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River.\n\nRussia may be conducting an information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations on the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to a prospective future Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast.\n\nSeveral Russian sources denounced a military commissar's claim that Russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers. An extension of the legal mandatory service period would not be necessary to keep current conscripts in the field, however, as all former conscripts are reservists, and all reservists are already eligible for mobilization.\n\nWe do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.\n\nUkrainian CounteroffensivesEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine (comprised of one subordinate and one supporting effort);\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortCapture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast\n\nRussian Supporting EffortSouthern Axis\n\nRussian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts\n\nActivities in Russian-occupied Areas\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives (Ukrainian efforts to liberate Russian-occupied territories)\n\nEastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast)\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly continued counter-offensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line on December 17. A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Sofiivka, Luhansk Oblast (21km northwest of Svatove).[24] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated that Ukrainian forces are advancing near Svatove and that the Svatove area is currently one of the most active sections of the front.[25] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Russian positions near Terny, Donetsk Oblast (17km northwest of Kreminna) and Nevske, Luhansk Oblast (18km northwest of Kreminna).[26] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces also conducted an assault in the direction of Holykove (10km north of Kreminna) in order to gain control of the R-66 highway (Svatove-Kreminna highway) and push Russian forces across the Krasna River.[27] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai reported that Ukrainian forces are also advancing near Kreminna.[28] Russian troops conducted limited counterattacks to regain lost positions near Kreminna. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna), Chervonopopivka (6km northwest of Kreminna) and Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna).[29]\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly continued to strike Russian rear areas in Luhansk Oblast on December 17. Russian and social media sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck Russian rears areas in Lantrativka (57km northeast of Svatove), Shchastia (78km southeast of Kreminna), and Kadiivka (60km southeast of Kreminna).[30]\n\nRussian Main EffortEastern Ukraine\n\nRussian Subordinate Main EffortDonetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russias proxies in Donbas)\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations around Bakhmut on December 17. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian assaults on Bakhmut itself, northeast of Bakhmut near Zelenopillya (4km northeast of Bakhmut), and south of Bakhmut near Opytne (3km south of Bakhmut) and Andriivka (10km southwest of Bakhmut).[31] Geolocated footage shows Ukrainian troops shelling Russian positions northeast of Bakhmut between Soledar (10km northeast of Bakhmut) and Bakhmutske (9km northeast of Bakhmut), indicating Russian forces have advanced in this area.[32] Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov posted footage reportedly of Chechen \"Akhmat\" special forces and elements of the Luhansk Peoples Republic 2nd Army Corps firing at Ukrainian positions in Soledar.[33] A Ukrainian volunteer serviceman reported that Wagner Group forces in Opytne are being reinforced either by fresh Wagner Group troops or conventional Russian servicemen, potentially marine detachments from the Vuhledar area.[34] A Russian milblogger reported that small arms exchanges are ongoing in Opytne and that Ukrainian troops are actively counterattacking south of Bakhmut near Kurdiumivka and Ozarianivka.[35] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian counterattacks northeast and south of Bakhmut.[36] Multiple Russian sources circulated footage of Ukrainian trenches in Bakhmuts city center, suggesting that this indicates Ukrainian troops are preparing for urban combat defense.[37]\n\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the western outskirts of Donetsk City on December 17. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops attacked near Marinka, Pobieda, and Novomykhailivka, all near the southwestern outskirts of Donetsk City.[38] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces attacked towards Vodiane, Pervomaiske, and Nevelske (all on the northwestern outskirts of Donetsk City) and that fighting is ongoing in the Marinka city center.[39] The Russian MoD claimed that Russian troops destroyed two Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups near Novomayorske and Shevchenko, about 50km southwest of Donetsk City.[40] The Ukrainian National Guard reported that national guardsmen successfully repelled a Russian attack near Velyka Novoselivka, about 70km southwest of Donetsk City and about 15km east of the Zaporizhia-Donetsk Oblast border.[41] Russian forces continued routine artillery fire along the line of contact in the Avdiivka-Donetsk City area, in western Donetsk Oblast, and in eastern Zaporizhia Oblast.[42]\n\nSupporting EffortSouthern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)\n\nUkrainian officials warned that Russian forces may be attempting to draw Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that unspecified Russian elements withdrew from Kakhovka and Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast to Nyzhni Sirohozy (at the T2209 and T2208 junction 50km southeast of the east bank of the Dnipro River) and that Russian forces have been telling locals that they will fully withdraw from the Kakhovka area by the new year.[43] Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Spokesperson Natalya Humenyuk stated that Ukrainian officials are verifying this information because Russian forces could be attempting to lure Ukrainian forces into a trap on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[44] It is very unlikely that Russian forces would be able to fake a withdrawal without Ukrainian forces detecting the deception.\n\nUkrainian forces continued to strike Russian rear areas in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian strikes against Russian force concentrations in Tokmak and Polohy, Zaporizhia Oblast wounded over 100 Russian military personnel and destroyed an ammunition depot on December 15.[45] A Ukrainian source reported explosions in Zalizynyi Port (along the Black Sea coastline in southwestern Kherson Oblast, 40km south of the east (left) bank of the Dnipro River) on December 17.[46]\n\nRussian forces continued artillery, rocket, and missile strikes against areas in southern Ukraine on December 17. Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces continued to conduct rocket and artillery strikes against frontline areas in Zaporizhia Oblast west of Hulyaipole.[47] Ukrainian officials stated that Russian forces shelled Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.[48] Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces shelled Kherson City and its environs on the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River.[49] Odesa Oblast Military Administration Spokesperson Serhiy Bratchuk stated that Ukrainian air defenses intercepted two Russian Onyx missiles that were heading towards Odesa Oblast on December 17.[50]\n\nRussia may be conducting a new information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations regarding the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) with a prospective future Ukrainian counteroffensive in Zaporizhia Oblast. A Russian milblogger claimed on December 17 that Ukraine seeks to force Russia to demilitarize the ZNPP using diplomatic means in order to reduce Russian forces ability to defend against a prospective Ukrainian counteroffensive towards Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[51] Russian milbloggers have previously misconstrued diplomatic efforts as attempts to handicap Russian forces at the ZNPP and claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron stated that both sides had reached a deal on the removal of heavy and light weapons from the ZNPP, when Macron only specified heavy weapons.[52] Such an information operation likely intends to undermine the ongoing negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish a security zone around the ZNPP as well as Ukraines status as the legitimate operator of the ZNPP.\n\nNote: ISW will report on activities in Kherson Oblast as part of the Southern Axis in this and subsequent updates. Ukraines counteroffensive in right-bank Kherson Oblast has accomplished its stated objectives, so ISW will not present a Southern Ukraine counteroffensive section until Ukrainian forces resume counteroffensives in southern Ukraine.\n\nMobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)\n\nSeveral Russian sources denounced a Moscow Oblast military commissar's claim that Russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers from 12 months to 18 for spring 2023 conscripts and two years for fall 2023 conscripts on December 17.[53] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reiterated that Russian law establishes conscripts period of service as 12 months and stated that there are no proposed changes to the current law but did not directly acknowledge the origin of the claim.[54] A Russian-government-aligned Telegram channel that denounces \"fake\" news stories noted that extending the general term for Russian conscripts would require the State Duma to amend federal law and gain approval from the Russian Federation Council and President Vladimir Putin.[55] Any legal attempt to extend the general term of service for conscripts would be both extremely unpopular with Russian domestic audienceseven those who support the warbut is also unnecessary if the Kremlin desires to keep conscripts fighting beyond their mandatory service periods. Russian law designates former conscripts as reservists following their term of conscript service, and all reservists are eligible for immediate mobilization under current Russian law.\n\nThe combination of war and sanctions seems to be starting to generate considerable dislocation of the Russian labor market. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin adopted temporary measures attempting to mitigate the impact of the war and Western sanctions on the Russian labor market on December 17.[56] A prominent Russian news outlet claimed that these measures partially reimburse employers for creating temporary jobs for citizens at risk of dismissal, organize paid public work projects, and provide for vocational training for industrial enterprise employees at risk of dismissal.[57] The outlet anticipated over 176,000 Russians will use these measures in 2023.[58] ISW has previously reported major Russian labor shortages due to the mobilization of a significant portion of the Russian workforce.[59] The combination of Russian measures to address layoffs and ongoing labor shortages suggests that Russia struggles to support a balanced distribution of labor across industries, facing a shortage in some areas and a surplus in areas that now lack support capacity.\n\nRussian authorities continue efforts to use civilian donations and mandated contributions to finance the war despite common civilian financial hurdles. \"Just Russia\" Party Leader Sergei Mironov called for the Russian government to begin issuing federal war bonds at an interest rate of 2%.[60] An opposition Russian news source reported on December 16 that at least two factories of a mineral processing company in Rostov Oblast have withheld 3-5% of workers wages for \"donations\" to the war effort without worker consent since October or December.[61] Another source reported that Russian Pension Fund employees at a single Novosibirsk branch \"voluntarily\" contributed 18 million rubles (about 277,457 USD) to support military needs.[62] Novosibirsk Oblast Legislative Assembly Deputy Aleksandr Terepa announced that contributions are completely voluntary and claimed authorities have no need to mandate contributions since all workers are so eager to donate.[63] However, ISW has extensively reported on the coercion of Russian workers to \"volunteer\" for partial salary diversions in support of the war effort in addition to resident-led drives to equip Russian soldiers.[64]\n\nRussian forces continue attempts to discourage desertion through threats of punishment. An open-source intelligence aggregator posted an intercepted call on December 17 in which a Russian wife warns her soldier husband that Russian authorities gather Russian soldiers who lay down their weapons and deploy them straight to the frontlines.[65] A Russian Telegram channel reported on December 16 that the Lugacom mobile service provider continues to send customers in Luhansk Oblast messages threatening that leaving military positions is criminally punishable desertion.[66] A Russian news outlet claimed that Russian authorities in Murmansk, Veliky Novgorod, and Solnechnogorsk handed down the first three sentences under Russian articles on desertion and unauthorized abandonment of a unit during mobilization on December 16.[67] However, Russian authorities appear hesitant to punish deserters through legal channels despite creating conditions so to do. The Russian opposition news source reported that judges waived two of the three sentences and that the third sentence remains unknown.[68]\n\nWestern sources continue to confirm that Russian units that were widely considered to be elite prior to the extension of the war in February have suffered significant losses in Ukraine. The Washington Post reported on December 16 the 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (of the 14th Army Corps of the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command) sustained devastating casualties as one of the first Russian units to assault Kharkiv City in the early phases of the war and was destroyed.[69] The Washington Post noted that \"endemic corruption, strategic miscalculations,\" and \"Kremlin failure to grasp the true capabilities of its own military or those of its adversary\" turned the 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade into a weak, demoralized unit artificially inflated with inexperienced conscripts.[70] This situation resembles the depleted state of the broader Russian forces and severely limits Russian combat capability, as ISW has previously reported.[71]\n\nRussian authorities continue to struggle to monitor mobilized soldiers. A Russian opposition news source reported on December 16 that Moscow police apprehended a mobilized soldier from Nizhny Novgorod walking through the Moscow metro carrying weapons he received in October.[72] The soldier reportedly left his position due to hospitalization but kept his weapons with him afterward.[73] Another Russian source reported on December 16 that authorities discovered a mobilized soldier dead in his tent from undetermined causes at the Sergievsky Training Ground, Sverdlovsk Oblast.[74]\n\nRussian forces appear to be facing logistical hurdles in an effort to gather military equipment in Mariupol due to personnel inefficiency and incompetence. Ukrainian Mariupol Mayoral Advisor Petro Andryushchenko reported on December 17 that Russian border guards created artificial problems leading to traffic jams with a large amount of military equipment moving from Russia to Mariupol toward Zaporizhia Oblast.[75] Russian forces in Mariupol also blocked traffic for hours while unsuccessfully attempting to navigate a Buk air defense missile system under a low railway bridge.[76] Andryushchenko added that Russia forces transport dragons teeth fortifications by \"continuous caravan\" on trucks likely from Stavropol Krai, over 500km from Mariupol.[77] Russian attempts to export dragons teeth over such a great distance would represent a major logistical challenge and resource commitment to the project.[78]\n\nActivity in Russian-occupied Areas (Russian objective: consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian civilians into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)\n\nRussian forces continue to rely on civilian labor in Russian-occupied territories to construct defensive fortifications in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian Mariupol Mayoral Advisor Petro Andryushchenko reported on December 17 that Russian forces and occupation officials have posted employment ads for civilians to construct defensive structures in Berdyansk Raion, Zaporizhia Oblast.[79] Andryushchenko reported that Russian forces previously used similar employment programs to force civilian workers from the Mariupol Ilyich Metallurgical Plant to build fortifications in Kherson Oblast in poor conditions without pay.[80] ISW has previously assessed that Russian occupation officials have mobilized residents in order to force them into constructing defensive fortifications.[81]\n\nRussian occupation officials are likely continuing to try to integrate Chechen elements into occupation administrations. A Russian milblogger posted an image on December 16 showing a propaganda billboard at the Mariupol Ilyich Metallurgical Plant that depicts Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) head Denis Pushilin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov.[82] The Donetsk Oblast occupation administrations inclusion of Kadyrov in its propaganda supports ISWs previous assessment that Russian occupation officials are likely seeking to integrate Chechen officials into their occupation structures.[83]\n\nNote: ISW does not receive any classified material from any source, uses only publicly available information, and draws extensively on Russian, Ukrainian, and Western reporting and social media as well as commercially available satellite imagery and other geospatial data as the basis for these reports.

                "cc_text": "Introduction\n\nSince Taiwans President Tsai Ing-wen () took office in May 2016, relations across the Taiwan Strait have grown increasingly tenseand even more so following the visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022. Following Beijings move to unilaterally suspend official and semiofficial cross-Strait contacts, the Chinese leadership has demonstrated the broad spectrum of the toolkit it wields against the island.\n\nBeijings toolkit includes disinformation campaigns and larger influence operation efforts to spread discord across the Taiwan public and paint Tsais Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as ill-equipped to govern. Other tactics include routine incursions into Taiwans Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and targeted import bans to hit critical agricultural sectors. Internationally, Beijing has sharply retracted the goodwill it extended to the previous administration, led by the more China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT), by poaching Taiwans diplomatic allies and blocking not only Taiwans access to international and regional fora, but also pressing these organizations to adopt Beijings framing of \"Taiwan as a part of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).\"\n\nPreserving and expanding Taiwans international space, broadly defined as its participation in and engagement with the larger global community, has been a consistent goal across recent Taiwan government administrationsbe it KMT or DPPsince the early 1990s. There are numerous ways Taiwan tries to remain active in the international arena, including by maintaining official and unofficial relations with other countries, participating in international political and economic organs, or engaging with external actors through its civil society and the nonprofit sectors. Taiwans objectives include obtaining support for its sovereignty claims; contributing to and gaining information from global debates with relevance back home; accessing preferential trade agreements or blocs; and shaping Taiwans global image, including trying to portray itself as a responsible stakeholder.\n\nWhile successive administrations in Taiwan have pursued different policies regarding the islands international space, these approaches were shaped in response to the geopolitical realities of the time. The current Tsai administration has arguably had to adapt to a disproportionately large number of world events, compared to previous administrations, including two major unprecedented ones in relative quick succession: the outbreak of COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis issue brief will first provide a succinct overview of the history of diplomatic competition between the Republic of China (ROC) and the PRC, which will be followed by a discussion of the policies advanced by the previous KMT administration under former President Ma Ying-jeou (). The piece will then explore the evolution of the Tsai administrations approach to securing Taiwans international space, including adjustments made in response to the global pandemic and increasing authoritarian aggression, and it will conclude with predictions on how Taiwans international engagement will persist beyond its elections in 2024.\n\nHistory\n\nCompetition for diplomatic recognition between the ROC and the PRC was borne with the inception of the latter and played out against the larger backdrop of the Cold War. Both were competing to be the \"true China\" and both maintained a \"one China\" baseline, refusing to forge diplomatic relations with a country that recognized the other, presenting countries with an \"either/or\" choice. This came to a head when the PRC had garnered sufficient support and backing to bring to a vote the issue of whether or not the PRC should hold the \"China\" seat at the United Nations (UN) to a votewhich ultimately passed with UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971.\n\nFollowing the passage of UN Resolution 2758, the number of countries recognizing the PRC surged, continuing further along this trajectory after the United States and the PRC normalized relations in 1979. Around the same time, Taipei began to place greater emphasis on the commercial and cultural elements of diplomacy. Coupled with Taipeis nascent democratization efforts at the time, this laid the foundation for an approach to international outreach that extended beyond the hard political elements of diplomacy and that tied the ROCs legitimacy to the Taiwan people and, by extension, positive perceptions of democracy worldwide (though this is not to underemphasize or devalue the contributions of the Dangwai () movement to Taiwans democratization).\n\nIn the early 1980s, the ROC lost its membership to major global financial organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, when its seat was transferred to the PRC. During this time, President Chiang Ching-kuo () adopted a policy of \"practical diplomacy\"maintaining a firm \"one China\" baseline for joining intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) while preserving space for flexibility in joining nongovernmental organizations under a \"no avoidance and no surrender\" mindset, and saw successes such as with the International Olympic Committee. Concurrently, though, Beijing persisted in blocking Taiwans access to nongovernmental organizations and in trying to lure away Taiwans remaining diplomatic allies.\n\nChiangs successor, Lee Teng-hui (), set forth a policy of \"pragmatic diplomacy\" () that sought to counteract Taipeis increasing international isolation by being less rigid about what his administration would be willing to accept, most critically on \"one China\" hard line. Early on in his administration, Lee touted his openness for dual-recognition (of two political entities under a common \"one China\") at IGOs and drove a largely unsuccessful effort to join and participate in these organizations. Under this approach, Taipei accepted countries having official ties with both the ROC and PRC, though Beijing remained steadfast in it being one or the other. Under the Lee administration, Taipei doubled down on informal diplomatic efforts, including by opening representative offices in dozens of countries, following the model it used with the United States and Japan from the decade prior, and utilizing unofficial travel for reciprocal exchanges between government officials; this latter approach was spurred in part by Taiwans burgeoning transition to a full democracy and surging economic growth.\n\nTaiwan took advantage of its economic strength to help grow its international space. It fostered deeper trade and investment relationships with major economies around the world, which lessened its reliance on the PRC market. It also used initial economic outreach to cultivate unofficial political ties with new partners, such as post-Soviet states, and offered foreign aid in what was known as \"dollar diplomacy\" for smaller, poorer countries, which often spurred these countries to switch diplomatic recognition from the PRC to the ROC. This latter practice, often criticized as \"checkbook diplomacy,\" persisted into the next administration.\n\nIn 2000, Taiwan had its first transition of power to the DPP, with Chen Shui-bian () elected as the first non-KMT president. In his first term, Chen undertook several conciliatory measures toward the PRC to try to chart a positive course for cross-Strait relations, including his \"Four Nos\" policy centered around not moving towards independence, and opening the three \"mini-links\" of direct cross-Strait trade, transport, and postal. Taiwan successfully joined the World Trade Organization and secured membership in eight IGOs and observer status in seven. Beijings recalcitrance due to its \"one China\" precondition prompted Chen to later shift gears and initiate what would be dubbed by his critics as \"scorched earth diplomacy (),\" intended to overwhelm the PRC with diplomatic feintsmaking motions to poach a diplomatic ally without following throughand to deplete Beijings resources so that Taiwan would face less resistance in achieving its actual priorities. Chen also sought to apply for UN membership for the first time as \"Taiwan\"rather than the ROCbut fumbled in his effort. This all led to wariness from the United States and other countries, all while accusations of checkbook diplomacy endured. Taiwan lost nine of its official diplomatic allies, and global perceptions of Taiwan soured. Chen also earned the unfortunate moniker of \"troublemaker,\" though this was due in no small part to PRC propaganda efforts.\n\nRecent approaches and developments\n\nUnder the Ma administration from 2008 to 2016, Taipei pursued a policy of \"flexible diplomacy\" () that sought to deepen trust with Beijing, project cross-Strait rapprochement into the international arena, and suspend ROC-PRC competition for diplomatic recognition. At the same time, the administration fostered positive relationships with Taiwans unofficial allies and sought meaningful participation in those international fora in which sovereignty was not a prerequisite.\n\nMa envisioned this policy as a course correction from his predecessors, concluding that the past \"scorched earth diplomacy\" and \"checkbook diplomacy\" had proved to be \"detrimental to Taiwans national interest\"; he also noted that \"mutual trust with our non-diplomatic allies has fallen, the number of our diplomatic allies has decreased, our participation in international activities has encountered unprecedented pressure, and Taiwans international image has worsened.\"\n\nA major component of this \"flexible diplomacy\" policy was the \"diplomatic truce ()\" in which Taiwan would no longer vie with the PRC for diplomatic recognition. While China never formally agreed to the truce, it tacitly accepted it by respecting the policy in practicewith rumors that Beijing rejected overtures from many of Taiwans diplomatic allies in Latin and South America to switch recognition.\n\nThe diplomatic truce era was revealing in that it showcased PRC priorities, with the management of cross-Strait relationsa core interest for the Chinese Communist Party leadershiptaking precedence over increasing the number of countries that recognize the PRC. This included corresponding gains for PRC bureaucracies in expanding the countrys global footprint (as there were whispers that certain elements of the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs were discontented about the diplomatic truce, due to it limiting the number of ambassadorships and posts available for PRC diplomats).\n\nThe example of Gambia in 2013 demonstrated most starkly Beijings resoluteness in tacitly accepting the diplomatic truce. When Gambia unilaterally cut ties with the ROC without prior consultation with Taipei or Beijing, it expected the latter to welcome its offer to formalize an official relationship. However, Beijing did not respond, and between November 2013 and January 2016, Gambia did not have formal diplomatic ties with either the ROC or the PRC, finding itself in the same position as Bhutan.\n\nThe flexible diplomacy policy also brought Taiwan tangible gains beyond maintaining a steady number of diplomatic allies from 2008 to 2016. Taiwan secured more access to international organizations, including specialized UN agencies. For example, it attended the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer from 2009 to 2016 and the International Civil Aviation Organizations (ICAO) Assembly in 2013 as an invited guest of its president. The Ma administration claimed that the policy fostered a political climate that allowed for a number of visa exemptions for Taiwan tourists in Western countries and paved the way for it to sign pseudo-free trade agreements for the first time with countries with which it did not have official ties, such as New Zealand and Singapore. Beijing likely permitted this because it had existing FTAs with those countries and in the agreements, Taiwan used its WTO designation as \"the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu\"; taken together, these measures provided enough ambiguity to not contradict the PRCs \"one China,\" achieved then through the \"1992 Consensus.\"\n\nMa likewise touted the successes of flexible diplomacy in recalibrating Taipeis unofficial relationship with the United States by demonstrating how Taiwan could be a \"responsible stakeholder.\" Mas focus on UN specialized agencies aligned with longstanding US support for Taiwans \"meaningful participation\" in organizations where \"statehood is not a requirement.\" While US-Taiwan relations were placed on a backburner as his administration prioritized cross-Strait rapprochement, the Ma era included the initiation of the Global Cooperation & Training Framework, which served as \"a platform to utilize Taiwans strengths and expertise to address global issues of mutual concern.\" The period also saw more routinized stopovers for President Ma and his Vice President Wu Den-yih () as they transited the United States en route to meetings with diplomatic allies in the Western Hemisphere (and with zero opposition from Beijing, contrasting sharply with complaints it lodged during the Chen era).\n\nAfter Taiwans general elections in 2016, in which the DPP took control of both the presidency and the legislature for the first time, it became all too apparent that the concerns of critics of the diplomatic truceand flexible diplomacy, more broadlywere valid and realized. Those that opposed or were skeptical of the diplomatic truce held that the policy was imbalanced, as it let Beijing wield all the cards, and the PRCs forbearance from poaching Taiwans diplomatic allies could easily be withdrawn and used as a tool to apply political pressure on Taipei, sparking a domino effect among the ROCs remaining official allies. Others also argued that the truce provided room for the PRC to advocate for the universality of its \"one China\" principle on the world stage.\n\nIn the four months between Tsais election and her inauguration, Beijing began to posture by signaling that it would constrict Taiwans international space if Tsai refused to accept the 1992 Consensus. Such actions were first seen in March of 2016, when the PRC abruptly established diplomatic relations with Gambiawhich presented Beijing with a unique opportunity. The PRC did not compel Banjul to switch recognition from the ROCwith state-affiliated media denying claims that this move meant an end to the tacit trucebut the PRC made clear that it could very much defy the diplomatic truce if desired. Beijing likewise delayed Taiwans annual WHA invitation, which, for the first time, included language on the importance of adhering to \"one China\"another thinly veiled threat that the preservation of Taiwans international space hinged on acquiescence to the 1992 Consensus.\n\nThe \"one China\" baseline for the 1992 Consensus is a nonstarter for the DPP, and Beijing viewed Tsais nod to the \"historical fact\" of the achievements and understandings reached since that year in her inauguration address as insufficient. Since then, the PRC has steadily poached Taiwans diplomatic allies, with only a minor lull during the pandemic, likely stemming from associated travel restrictions. Eight of Taiwans diplomatic allies have switched their recognition from the ROC to the PRC, with thirteen country allies and the Holy See now remaining. However, there have been rumors recently that Paraguay insisted on a $1 billion investment from Taipei to resist \"enormous pressure\" from the PRC to switch recognition (though these comments were quickly addressed).\" In some instances, these announcements on changes in diplomatic recognition were deliberately timed to signal discontent with the Tsai administration or advancements in US-Taiwan relations. For example, Beijing established relations with Sao Tome and Principe following Trumps phone call with Tsai after he was elected and with Panama as Taiwan representatives were participating in the Biden administrations \"Summit for Democracy.\" Notably, many of the former ROC allies that Beijing has successfully poached since 2016 are geographically situated in strategically-important locations.\n\nTaiwan has also seen its access to international organizations and fora restricted and has not received an invitation to attend the WHA since 2016, despite a global pandemic and Western efforts to push for its inclusion. Fears that Beijing would double down on its narrative that \"one China\" is an international norm were also substantiated, with PRC representatives and proxies justifying Taiwans exclusion from these meetings with false claims that UN Resolution 2758which shifted the holder of the \"China\" seat at the UN from the ROC to the PRC in 1971embodied \"one China\" and thus came to a UN-level determination on the status of Taiwan.\n\nFundamentally, the eight years under former President Ma and the early Tsai years brought to the fore just how critical \"one China\" and its associated 1992 Consensus are as a baseline for leadership in Beijing to set the tone first and foremost for cross-Strait relations and also for PRC-ROC interactions globally. This includes how swiftly PRC approaches can turn from one of forbearancewith demonstrated restraint in peeling off the ROCs diplomatic allies and permitting participation in international organizationsto one of coercion, used as a leveraging tool to pressure Taipei to adopt policies in line with Beijings goals and objectives.\n\nPolicies under President Tsai\n\nSince President Tsai came to power in May 2016, her administration has pursued a foreign policy strategy that shares contours with that of her predecessors, but with required adjustments due to changes in its strategic environment. These include evolving dynamics in the Taiwan Strait, in Sino-US relations, and Taiwans corresponding role in the wider triangular relationship and globally.\n\nSince 2016, cross-Strait relations have had greater rigidity, which extends into the broader international realm. Taipei faces a Catch-22 situation: as it seeks to further expand its international spacein part to hedge against PRC pressureit reinforces perceptions in Beijing that Taiwan is asserting autonomy and working counter to \"one China,\" which further exacerbates tensions in the Taiwan Strait and with continued spillover internationally. Thus, as outlined above, many of Taiwans efforts to preserve its international space have been unsuccessfulespecially those relating to the UN and to retaining official diplomatic allies. This is in spite of the fact that President Tsai has maintained more or less the same positions on these fronts as former President Ma, namely, focusing on joining specialized UN agencies as an observer or nonmember and vowing to refrain from zero-sum checkbook diplomacy.\n\nAnother shift has been a hardening of US views toward the PRC. This began with the Trump administration, but has persisted into the Biden administration and showcases bipartisan consensus on the PRC as a major strategic competitor. US-Taiwan relations have deepened over the past six years, building on renewed confidence achieved under the Ma years. These deeper ties are characterized by a number of high-level visits, including by a cabinet secretary; a slew of Congressional legislation on Taiwan, such as calls for helping it regain observer status at UN-affiliated organizations and maintain its official diplomatic relationships; and regular official statements reiterating US support for Taiwan.\n\nFurthermore, since Joe Bidens inauguration in January 2021, his administration has weaved Taiwan into many of its larger policy efforts. The Biden administration has emphasized the importance of cross-Strait stability in several multilateral fora and in joint statements with key partners and allies, including those in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. It has likewise linked Taiwans security with broader US interests in the Indo-Pacific region and fostered deeper economic dialogue between Taipei and Washington. The Biden administration has stressed the importance of values-based diplomacy, with Biden himself asserting, \"we must start with diplomacy rooted in Americas most cherished democratic values,\" and calling democracy \"the grounding wire of our global policyour global power\" and \"Americas abiding advantage.\" At the Summit of Democracywhich Taiwan participated inhe highlighted his view that defending democracies would be \"the defining challenge of our time.\"\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Tsais foreign policy contains converging and complementary elements with Bidens. Tsai emphasizes Taiwans contributions to the international community, noting that despite restrictions, Taiwan has positioned itself as a responsible stakeholder that enables regional peace and security. More critically, she underscores the importance of Taiwans democracy, writing in Foreign Affairs that Taiwan \"lies at the intersection of contending systems\" and amidst \"a contest of ideologies,\" presenting Taiwan as a bastion of defense against authoritarianism and democratic-backsliding. Its essential to note that this approach has been imperfect. The Tsai administration has been unable to square its calls for an \"Alliance of Democratic Values\" with the contradiction that the bulk of its official diplomatic partners are among the worlds least free states (though this has been a pervasive issue across presidencies).\n\nRobust public diplomacy efforts, including on social media platforms, have been a key facet of Tsais strategy for expanding Taiwans international space. Building off the pan-green coalitions greater familiarity with social media, which first saw demonstrated successes in Taiwans 2014 local elections, Tsaialongside other government officials and DPP leadershas built solid followings on Facebook and Instagram, tailored toward domestic audiences, and on Twitter, for engagement outside of Taiwan. Tsai has called social media a means for Taiwan to \"enter the global conversation\" that \"helps Taiwan connect with the world.\"\n\nThese public diplomacy efforts have ramped up in the past two years, due in part to an overall increase in online presence globally as most of the world quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tsai administration used this window of opportunity to informally expand its international space and advocate for its inclusion in formal ones. The momentum has continued, with Taiwan using public diplomacy and social media to stress its invaluable role in the fight against authoritarianism; engage with like-minded countries, specifically in Eastern Europe; and voice its unwavering support for Ukraine, as the worlds focus has turned to the Russian invasion, and some have inadvertently drawn parallels with a potential Taiwan invasion scenario.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of 2019 shone a light on the frailty of Taiwans position internationally, while also providing the island with a chance to showcase its ability to serve as a responsible stakeholder and contribute to global pandemic relief effortsboth because of and despite its relative isolation on the world stage.\n\nTaiwan quickly implemented measures to contain COVID-19 due in part to its mistrust of the global international health system resulting from the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s. Taiwan could not obtain SARS information or samples from the WHO because it was not a recognized member and was instead referred to Beijing. Notably, Taiwans Center for Disease Control in late 2019 used WHO-designated communication mechanisms put into place to institutionalize Taiwan as subordinate to the PRCto raise questions on the transmissibility of the coronavirus only to have the request more or less dismissed. Taiwan then opted to begin prevention initiatives without waiting for formal WHO guidance.\n\nAccordingly, Taiwan was one of the few places in 2020 that allowed its citizens relative normalcy and was commended for its COVID-19 response. As a result, Taipei sought to share its best practices through soft power campaigns such as \"#TaiwanCanHelp\" that was spearheaded by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an organization self-described as an \"international cross-party group of legislators working towards reform on how democratic countries approach China.\" Taiwan also engaged in \"mask diplomacy,\" sending masks and personal protective equipment to its official diplomatic allies and to the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus, such as Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Taiwans scientists and medical practitioners also were able to take part in research collaborations with countries such as the United States and the Czech Republic.\n\nDespite these contributions and the prominent \"#LetTaiwanHelp\" campaign, Taiwan was still unable to participate in WHA meetings. Limitations on Taiwans public health outreach, particularly in vaccine distribution (with high demand, finite supply, and the governments difficulty balancing between providing vaccines to allies versus its unofficial relationships), arguably also made its official diplomatic allies more susceptible to PRC enticementswith Taiwans Ministry of Foreign Affairs accusing Beijing of using the offer of vaccines to compel Paraguay to switch its recognition.\n\nNonetheless, the pandemic period reinforced several points in the eyes of international observers:\n\nThe PRC prioritizes its self-interests even during a global pandemic despite its rhetoric calling for international cooperation.\n\nTaiwan can make valuable contributions to support global health, and its exclusion comes to the detriment of the international community.\n\nTaiwan can expand its global footprint through nontraditional channels by leveraging its messaging on social media through hashtag campaigns and bringing greater awareness to the value it can add and the challenges it faces vis--vis the PRC.\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\nRussias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to renewed attention on Taiwan, with the international community drawing parallels between Russia and Ukraine and the PRC and Taiwan. Many saw the shared plights of democracies striving to preserve their way of life in the face of a looming authoritarian aggressor. This has prompted several like-minded countriesincluding post-Soviet states that have faced similar threatsto offer greater support for Taiwan. Beginning with Beijings overreaction to Pragues signing of a sister-city agreement (which promotes cultural and business ties) with Taipei in 2019, hesitation in Central and Eastern Europe has grown over the PRCs influence in the region, including mounting disaffection for Chinas 17 + 1 regional framework (now down to 14 due to withdrawals by Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia) and disillusionment about promised Chinese investment through its Belt and Road Initiative. Partly as a result, Taiwans unofficial relations with Eastern European and Baltic states have since deepened.\n\nThe most prominent example is the case of Lithuania, which in July 2021, announced that Taiwan would open a representative office in its capital, Vilnius, and that a reciprocal office would be opened in Taipei. Notably, the office would be called the \"Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania,\" diverging from the nomenclature used in similar offices with Taiwans other unofficial relationships, which include some formulation around \"Taipei\" (i.e., Taiwans de facto embassy in the United States is called the \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office\"). This was met with fervent backlash from the PRCas \"Taipei\" preserves a certain amount of neutrality and avoids allusions to sovereignty that using \"Taiwan\" or \"ROC\" could denote (Taiwans official embassies hold the name of the latter).\n\nIn the months leading up to the offices formal opening and during its aftermath, Beijing levied numerous punitive measures against Vilnius, such as recalling its ambassador and downgrading diplomatic relations, as well as a swath of coercive economic actions that included removing Lithuania from its customs system and imposing informal secondary sanctions and targeted import bans. Vilnius did not succumb to pressure, and Taiwan launched its office in November 2021 and opened a reciprocal office for Lithuania in Taipei a year later. PRC moves against Taiwantaken in conjunction with existing wariness over Beijings human rights record, growing authoritarianism, and tacit support for Russias invasionhave further soured Chinas image in Eastern Europe.\n\nHeightened reservations towards the PRC have seemingly gone hand-in-hand with enhanced contacts with Taipei, which is viewed as an ideological peer, underscoring how an emphasis on democracy and on common values and goals has increased global awareness of cross-Strait issues and brought in new stakeholders. Examples of Taiwans deepening support in Eastern Europe abound, including Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia leaving the PRC-led 17 + 1 forum; the first-ever joint visit to Taiwan by parliamentarians from Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia; the signing of cooperation agreements between the Czech Republic and Taiwan; an unprecedented meeting with EU parliamentarians and Taiwans foreign minister in Brussels; and ongoing support for an EU-Taiwan Bilateral Investment Agreement.\n\nNotably, these countries have been willing to bear the brunt of any PRC retaliation resulting from enhanced ties with Taiwan. This is partly because they benefit from membership in multilateral organizations such as the European Union and NATO, which have both voiced concerns and released statements critical of PRC actions against their member states; such membership allows for corresponding burden-sharing and solidarity against coercive measures from Beijing. For example, in December 2022, the EU brought the PRCs earlier export embargo on Lithuania to the WTO, calling the moves \"discriminatory and coercive.\" The EU has likewise come out with statements reaffirming \"one China\" but stressing that EU policy permits it to \"[persist with and intensify] our cooperation with Taiwan.\"\n\nThis momentum is likely to continue, yielding tangible benefits for both Taiwan and its European partners through the many Memoranda of Understanding and investment agreements signed covering areas such as bilateral trade, collaboration among start-ups, and the sharing of technical expertise, including on semiconductors. Trade data suggests a similar conclusion, with Taiwans Ministry of Economic Affairs highlighting that its exports to Central and Eastern Europe reached a \"record high\" of $1.38 billion during the first four months of 2022.\n\nLooking forward\n\nThe PRC has made clear that its forbearance on condoning Taiwans international space is explicitly tied to the Taiwan leaderships recognition of the 1992 Consensus\" and \"one China.\" Taipei is unlikely to adopt such policies given that demographic identity trends suggest support for the DPPs more Taiwan-centric policies will only increase in the future. In addition, PRC leader Xi Jinping has seemingly tied the 1992 Consensus to \"One Country, Two Systems,\" which has left the formulation unpalatable for Taiwans people and its viability as a core element of the KMTs cross-Strait policy unclear.\n\nAs such, the PRC will continue employing all available means to squeeze Taiwans international space. Beijing has demonstrated that no event, meeting, or area has been too insignificant to assert its framing of the Taiwan issue, as demonstrated by PRC pressure on even high schools and bicycle associations trying to gain UN access or accreditation. The PRC may continue poaching Taiwans official diplomatic alliesthough some analysts speculate that debate exists as to whether too aggressive of an approach could inspire movements towards independence; some staunchly pro-independence groups view \"diplomatic zero\" as a way for Taiwan to shed what they view as the inconvenient legacy of the ROC. Further, the PRC will continue trying to weaken Taiwans unofficial contacts with other countries even as Taiwan seeks to expand them, using its full coercive toolkit to include trade restrictions and political pressure.\n\nYet, as the ROCs diplomatic history has shown, its leadership and people are adaptivereshaping their policies and priorities to better align with global trends and developments. Many of the successes of the Tsai administration, such as its effective messaging strategies, especially in tying Taiwans fate with global democracy promotion efforts, will likely endure in subsequent Taiwan administrations.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThere are a number of avenues that Taiwan, the United States, and US allies and partners can pursue to preserve and increase Taiwans international space. These efforts can leverage some of the lessons learned from the international community following Russias invasion of Ukraine and build on some of the successes Taiwan has had in burnishing its image and expanding its outreach through nontraditional channels during COVID.\n\nExpand and transition working-level relationships into more formalized frameworks and mechanisms\n\nDespite Chinas relative success in denying Taiwans official participation in international organizations, Taiwan has been able to use bilateral and multilateral working-level relationships to circumvent these restrictions. Taiwan has gained significant traction over the past five years in deepening its ties with countries, such as those in Eastern Europe, that share similar values and face similar threats; these efforts form the basis for expanded ties. Moreover, the outpouring of support and attention Taiwan received in the aftermath of Russias invasion of Ukraine and around Speaker Pelosis visit and the subsequent Chinese military exercise suggest ample opportunities exist for crafting an allied approach to formalize and upgrade engagement with Taiwan. Such efforts would provide a measure of security against Chinese coercive efforts through increased international ties and could involve the following:\n\nIncrease engagement with developing countries, particularly those in the Global South. These countries not only serve as a critical voting bloc within the UN, but they are also particularly vulnerable to PRC influence and pressurewith stark implications for transparency, good governance, and foreign policy independence. Taiwan officials could conduct such outreach bilaterally or in collaboration with the United States and its partners on a range of topics such as technology, civil society development, and agricultural best practices, as well as through continued efforts under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework. Utilize and advance formalized mechanisms for promoting Taiwans resilience. Pursuing targeted approaches to Taiwans existing diplomatic allies, similar to what has been described in the US Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of 2019 (TAIPEI Act) that became law in 2020, could increase Taiwans resilience to PRC coercion. Such efforts could include expanding and deepening coordination with key US partners in areas of mutual interest. It could also involve more robust and regionally-focused approaches, such as enhanced collaboration with Australia and New Zealand to counteract PRC pressure on Taiwans remaining allies in the South Pacific. US allies and partners should likewise prioritize supporting Taiwans growing unofficial relationships in Eastern Europe. Embed Taiwans economic ties in bilateral trade agreements. As the Lithuania example showcased, a growing number of countries around the world are willing or able to bear the brunt of economic pressure from the PRC resulting from their engagement with Taiwan. In some cases, this reflects countries that are less economically integrated with and reliant on the PRC and those that can contend with Beijings moves to weaponize deeper trade ties. Accordingly, these countries could make ideal partners for Taiwan to pursue free trade agreements with, offering an alternative to Mas approach in which Taiwan could only sign agreements with countries that had existing ones with the PRC. This would enable Taiwan to diversify its economy and lessen its reliance on the PRC market, creating more resilience against economic pressure from Beijing. Safeguard Taiwans access to multilateral fora. To date, Chinas efforts to restrict Taiwans access to international fora have been concentrated on political and security-focused entities, rather than economic ones. Taiwans participation in economic organizations such as APEC has thus far been largely untouched. As the PRC continues to constrict Taiwans international space, Taiwan, the United States, and like-minded countries should look at ways to jointly proactively counter Chinese efforts to impede Taiwans access to economic organizations, including by using institutional bylaws or pressure to restrict Taiwans access.\n\nIncrease coordination to shape the narrative on Taiwan globally\n\nEfforts to counter Beijings narrative that Taiwan is a part of the PRC could also yield major dividends, given that this narrative has been used to justify Taiwans exclusion from many international fora and venues during the past two decades. Since its entry into the international community in the early 1970s, the PRC has worked to normalize this stance through the internationalization of \"one China\" and its efforts to embed this position within organizations. The United States has pushed back and should continue to do so, coordinating its messaging with other countries that hold \"one China\" policies that do not take a position on Taiwans status. In the lead-up to and aftermath of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosis August 2022 visit to Taiwan, PRC propaganda organs pushed forth a relentless and false narrative that the visit violated commitments made under the United States \"one China\" policy. Beijing likewise used this argument to assign blame on the United States and its allies for changing the status quo and to try to justify increased incursions into Taiwans ADIZ, including past the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and in conducting military exercises closer to the island. This underscores the need for US allies and partners to develop a networked approachwith simultaneous and joint efforts to clarify their policies and to refute PRC claimsto counter Chinas overt and covert attempts at narrative control.\n\nForecast and plan for the future\n\nOne consistent element in Taiwans foreign policy across administrations has been its leaderships ability to adjust to the changing times and adapt recommendations so that Taiwan can optimize opportunities. Taiwans domestic political trends point to the increasing popularity of pan-green parties cross-Strait approaches and the increasing unpopularity of the KMTs 1992 Consensusboth of which the PRC will likely respond to by continuing to clamp down on Taiwans international space. In anticipation of further Chinese attempts to restrict its access, Taiwan should continue looking for channels to expand its international space in which the PRC has less or no influence. One particularly effective approach has been participating in multilateral discussions in which the PRC is not a member, such as the Halifax Security Forum, the Summit for Democracy, and the Open Parliament Forum. The United States and its allies could also encourage greater alignment on any offensive or defensive approaches to maximize Taiwans international space and help Taiwan build its capacity and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\nFinally, Taiwan should take advantage of enhanced multilateral ties to foster and hone deeper bilateral ones with more like-minded countries. This would permit Taiwan not only to further internationalize cross-Strait issues but also to cushion against the potential impact on its interests of fickle partisan politics in friendly democracies that change the direction and level of engagement of foreign policy. Expanding bilateral ties with newer supporters will help avoid overreliance on traditional backers and ensure the longevity and effectiveness of actions designed to preserve and expand Taiwans international space.\n\nGlobal China Hub The Global China Hub researches and devises allied solutions to the global challenges posed by Chinas rise, leveraging and amplifying the Atlantic Councils work on China across its fifteen other programs and centers.

                "cc_text": "This contribution highlights the effects of this war in the opposite direction to what Putin was seeking, both in Ukraine - on the basis of popular mobilizations for dignity - but also in its Eurasian neighbourhood, as well as in NATO and the EU. It discusses interpretations of a NATO essentialized as hostile to Russia and of a reactive Russian war. While underlining the negative legacies to be overcome on the left on national questions in an internationalist project, the aim is to identify, from the issues raised by the war and the Ukrainian popular aspirations, axes of alterglobalist resistance in/against the EU.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine decided by Putin on 24 February has produced the opposite of all its objectives. The resistance to this aggression reveals what is happening to a Ukraine that is supposed to belong to \"one Russian people\" and to be marked since the crisis of 2013-2014 by a \"Nazi coup\" supported by the West and threatening genocide against the Russian-speaking population.\n\nI share the criticism of this thesis by left-wing Ukrainian authors who are critically independent of all imperialist and state propaganda (including Zelenskys). [1] These criticisms do not, of course, imply neglecting the importance (in Ukraine as in Russia, in France and elsewhere in the world) of extreme right-wing forces, their ideological evolution and differentiation and their relationship to institutions and violence, their means. [2] The outcome of the war will also weigh on these factors. From the point of view of the totalitarian excesses of the state apparatus, Ukraine compares very favourably with the state of the Russian Federation and its control of the oli-garchs against the \"oligarchic pluralism\" of Ukraine and its greater margins of freedom. [3]\n\nA society mobilized for its dignity - in peace and in war\n\nIt is precisely such margins, which do not exist in Russia, that have repeatedly allowed for the challenge of the autocrats in power at the ballot box and on the streets. This was the case with the \"Orange Revolution\" of 2004, which was catalysed by the rejection of corruption and electoral fraud and marked by popular hope in new, supposedly democratic parties that claimed to be \"pro-European\". Disillusionment with these parties, themselves plagued by corruption, explains the victory of Yanukovych (said to be pro-Russian) in the 2010 elections in a policy that was intended to provide balance between Russia and the EU. But the process of checking the promises made against the test of power continued in the face of the practices of the new oligarchic president, his vertical decisions, the enrichment of his family and the violence of his repressive forces. In 2014, these were the deep sources of his discredit even in his own region - hence his flight to Russia. Thus, beyond the violent and confused episodes, certainly marked by both Western support and the harsh stewarding force of the extreme right protecting the demonstrators in 2014, the fall of Yanu-kovych (ratified by the parliament) was first and foremost due to a new popular \"disengagement\", whatever its instrumentalization by various right wing forces.\n\nThe confusions of these uprisings resemble those of the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Jackets) and so many other mass movements in confused political and social contexts. The limits of this \"revolution\" are also obvious: the oligarchic regime has by no means been removed. But the label \"revolution\" expresses the accumulation of experiences that give lasting and profound force to the periodic mobilizations of a society in search of social justice.\n\nIt was the mass uprising of 2014 that was called the \"revolution of dignity\", evoking the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who organized themselves to occupy Independence Square (Maidan) while expressing multiple demands. It was also referred to less convincingly as the \"Euro-Maidan\" - which tended to misleadingly reduce the movement to a \"pro-European\" uprising. But it was assimilated, in Moscow and by part of the left, to a \"colour revolution\" (like 2004), reduced to being a pawn instrumentalized by the NATO powers. This approach (or rather ignorance) of the society can be found in the current war. Another part of the left chose to join Madan by fighting on several fronts. [4]\n\nHowever, these popular aspirations and this critical autonomy of society from the institutional parties continued to manifest themselves, after the supposed \"Nazi coup\", during the five-year term of the new president and oligarch Petro Poroshenko elected in 2014: this was shown by the lack of stabilization of the new power and its final fall in 2019. After the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of the hybrid war in the Donbas (killing some 15,000 people), the country experienced government crises and financial scandals affecting the president. He took hardly any social measures to help the thousands of people fleeing the conflicts in Donbas and was unable to overcome the impasse in the Minsk Agreements. [5] The populations autonomy of choice was again manifested, five years after the so-called Western-controlled \"coup\", by the surprise election of a Jewish actor from outside the existing political parties whose mother tongue was Russian. It was a campaign promising a peaceful resolution of the Donbas conflict and a crackdown on corruption that secured him an unprecedented landslide majority across the country (far removed from the far-right themes that Poroshenko had partly taken up). [6]\n\nThe popular mobilization against the invasion and the mobilization of the Zelensky government at its head - also unforeseen by NATO forces - consolidated Zelenskys popularity, across the political spectrum, throughout Ukraine. It was in practice a popular choice of Ukrainian sovereignty. This is especially true among the large mass of the countrys Russian-speaking eastern and southern population - supposedly saved from \"Nazi genocide\". Russian forces are far from controlling the territory of the regions annexed after pseudo-referendums and are struggling to find mayors willing to run the cities.\n\nAgainst the interpretations (and multiple quotes) according to which NATO pushes Ukraine to an endless war to bring down Russia, it is rather in the opposite direction of the pressures to temper the Ukrainian offensive that we witnessed in early November. It was the NATO staff that moderated Zelenskys denunciations attributing to Russia the strikes that killed two people in Poland. In reality, if it is true that without the arms and the obvious logistical help provided to the Ukrainian army, it would have been in a weak position and would have been forced to surrender quickly, the strength of the resistance and the victories won are - beyond the weapos - due to the determination of a population resisting an aggression experienced for what it is - neo-colonial, imperial.\n\nWhich left called on the Vietnamese to negotiate - rather than to win?\n\nWould the Left doubt the reality of resistance as a national liberation struggle if the \"military operation had been launched by France against \"French Algeria\"? The form taken by Russian colonization, and then Stalinist policy, weighs heavily. This is a fact that the feminist decolonial writer from Sri Lanka living in India Rohini Hensman points out:\n\nWhile the colonies of the Western European imperialist powers were mainly overseas, the Mongol, East European and Ottoman empires colonized adjoining countries, so it was easy to make the mistake of blurring the distinction between empire and state. While no one would think of India as part of the British state, when Putin considers Ukraine to be part of the Russian state, he is not alone, and it is not the first time he has done so. [7]\n\nBut it also highlights, as Bernard Drano does very clearly (also comparing Ukraine and Ireland) [8] disagreements dividing Marxists (and Bolsheviks) in particular on national issues. [9]\n\nIgnoring, obscuring or denigrating Ukraine as a decisive actor in both Putins aims and the resistance to his aggression is at the root of a mistaken assimilation of the current war to an inter-imperialist world war - as was the First World War. Such a presentation obviously justifies the revival of the great slogans of pacifism and revolutionary defeatism of the time and the call to turn everywhere against an \"enemy\" that is \"in ones own country\". I dissociated myself from this interpretation of the ongoing war as soon as I refused to sign the international feminist pacifist appeal [10] which - rightly - showed solidarity with Russian feminist pacifists but failed to recognize the Ukrainian feminists \"right to resist\". [11] Numerous texts (by left-wing women and men in Ukraine defending this right - and the right to protect themselves, now and in the future, including with weapons) make this debate explicit in a collection that should be read and discussed. [12]\n\nThis right to resist Russian domination obviously has globalized effects. We will come to this later. It is important to underline a specific impact, essential for the future and the outcome of this war, in the former Soviet republics that are in Russias immediate environment. This is what we will limit ourselves to mentioning here in order to draw attention to it. This will be Belarus [13] - associated with several Russian projects, including the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) - on the one hand, and Kazakhstan, which is essential to the military alliance with Russia and several other states (Collective Security Treaty Organization - CSTO) that was formed at the very beginning of 2022 following the unprecedented riots affecting this country in 2021.\n\nGeopolitical issues in Eurasia\n\nBelarus between organic union with Russia and the EEU\n\nPutins decision was not only marked by a misjudgement of Ukrainian society. It was also based on the outcome of the annexation of Crimea. While that annexation had been greeted with patriotic popular enthusiasm in Russia, it had produced quite different reactions among the autocrats of the allied post-Soviet republics. But Putin was to underestimate this factor because of recent developments in Belarus and Kazakhstan.\n\nFirst, it should be recalled that the annexation of Crimea broke with the 1994 Buda-pest Protocol signed by Russia with Ukraine (and similarly with Belarus and Kazakhstan) with US support: the agreement provided for Russia to recover all Soviet-era nuclear weapons but in return had to respect the borders of the newly independent states. While this annexation was popular in Russia, it was viewed with apprehension by the oligarchs of Belarus and Kazakhstan who were attached to their state sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, Putins orientation pragmatically played on several scenarios and types of unions. On the one hand, he hoped that Ukraine and Belarus would move closer to Russia to consolidate a \"Russian pole\" in the construction of a Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). This was inspired by the European Union in its shared community and separate dimensions (respecting state sovereignty). The project aimed to integrate all the ex-Soviet countries located between the Russian Federation and the EU (including in particular Georgia and Armenia, in addition to Belarus and Ukraine) - exactly the same countries that were targeted for participation in the \"Eastern Partnership\" project launched by the European Union in 2009. It was Yanukovychs hes-itation and ultimately his choice not to sign the partnership agreement with the EU that provoked the 2013 crisis. [14]\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea, President Lukashenko, who had been ruling Belarus for some 25 years, had distanced himself from Putin, moving closer to the EU to diversify his dependencies and escape sanctions. The autocrat preferred to negotiate with a Russian power weakened under Yeltsin than with a Putin who had reestablished control over his own oligarchs and had clear ambitions. But he did not hesitate to turn to the latter when his own power was threatened in 2020-2021 by the popular uprising against electoral fraud.\n\nA process of negotiation of a close union involving constitutional changes in Bela-rus then began between the two leaders: they allowed the presence of Russian mili-tary bases (even nuclear ones); but they reaffirmed the countrys neutrality and thus ruled out (for now) any direct entry into war. Lukashenko found himself obliged to specify that the country had not been \"swallowed\". [15]\n\nBut this development underlines - far from fatalistic interpretations of Russian expansionism - that these recent rapprochements have gone against the grain of the tensions visible between 2014 and 2022. It was thus a key context for understanding Putins optimism in deploying troops to Ukraines borders in Belarus in early 2022. But it was also the instability of Lukashenkos power in his own society that was re-vealed in the search for such a rapprochement at the top and at the military level. And this underlines that this is also a possible source of weakness for Putins war adventure.\n\nThe resistance encountered in Ukraine and therefore the duration and violence of the war certainly imply a more radical internal repressive course in Russia and in Belarus. But it is far from being without flaws. And these flaws are essential for the future. In the very first days of the war there were expressions of trade union solidarity against this invasion. They were quickly met (like in Russia) with radical repression, especially against the leaders of the Congress of Democratic Trade Unions of Belarus (BKDP) and the trade unions of the metal industry (SPM) and the radio electronics industry (REP). This repression has prompted trade union solidarity protests, par-ticularly from Russia (from the KTR - the Russian Confederation of Labour founded in 1995, which is itself under threat), and from Ukraine - from the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, the KVPU. [16] The Belarusian railway workers have in fact undertaken \"partisan\" actions that will surely play a key role in / against this war - to make it difficult for Russian troops to get reinforcements and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nNo nation in the world wants war. The Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian peoples are no exception. Few peoples in the world have suffered such terrible losses and sacrificed the lives of tens of millions of their citizens in their history as have our three peoples, peoples who are so close to each other. And the fact that the Russian government launched a war against Ukraine today cannot be understood, justified or forgiven. The fact that the aggressor invaded Ukraine from the territory of Belarus with the consent of the Belarusian authorities can neither be justified nor forgiven. Irreparable things have happened, and their long-term consequences on the lives of several generations will poison relations between Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. On behalf of the members of the independent trade unions of Belarus, the workers of our country, we bow to you, our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. We apologize to you for the shame, the shame that the Belarusian government has imposed on all Belarusians, by becoming an ally of the aggressor and opening the border with Ukraine. However, we would like to assure you, dear Ukrainians, that the vast majority of Belarusians, including workers, condemn the reckless actions of the current Belarusian regime in tolerating Russian aggression against Ukraine. We demand an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, as well as from Belarus. [17]\n\nThe progress of the Ukrainian resistance will have a specific direct impact on all post-Soviet societies, especially those (open to relations with Moscow but also with China and the West) with which Moscow wants to stabilize and expand the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). [18] The latter is obliged to respect the sovereignty of the states. Moscows ability to exploit the internal conflicts of each of the societies in its particular environment (such as Armenia in its conflicts with Azerbaijan) is not a matter of pure power relations. Whether it is a question of autocratic powers in post-Soviet societies or societies aspiring to more democracy and social justice, the inde-pendence of new states is a strong feature of the new post-Soviet historical phase.\n\nThe neo-colonial and brutal dimensions of the Russian intervention in Ukraine are and will be destabilizing factors and tensions in Moscows relations with its neighbours. This is true for what will happen, beyond Belarus, to the EEU but also to its military counterpart - the Collective Security Treaty Organization - CSTO. [19]\n\nCSTO - and the Kazakhstan test before and after the Russian invasion.\n\nThis military alliance includes five former Soviet republics (Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan) with Russia. It was born after the failure of previous, much larger projects. Copying NATO and aiming to either counterbalance its weight or negotiate spheres of influence, its Article 4 is the equivalent of Article 5 of the Atlantic Alliance: in case of an act of aggression against one of the member states, all the others must provide the necessary assistance, including military. But in practice, this military alliance had not intervened as such until the beginning of 2022. In 2019, it acquired a 20,000-strong rapid reaction force and a 3,600-strong peacekeeping force recognized by the UN. Opaque power struggles have become entangled with unprecedented social riots protesting against liquefied natural gas price hikes (involving multinational firms).\n\nAt the end of 2021, Kazakhstans president appealed to the CSTO by declaring a \"state of emergency\" allegedly caused by \"foreign intervention\". The return to calm was facilitated by social measures. But the CSTO forces intervened at the beginning of January 2022 and withdrew after a week. Moscow was certainly counting on taking advantage of what appears to be a success for other tasks to come in the face of global disorder and NATOs debacle in Afghanistan.\n\nIndeed, it was the fear of Taliban interventions from Afghanistan that, at the end of the CSTO operation in Kazakhstan - and thus just before the invasion of Ukraine - prompted proposals for the consolidation and extension of the interventions of this military Alliance: the Russian representative within the Alliance thus evoked the objective of \"creating a security belt not only around Afghanistan, but also around the CSTO\". [20]\n\nSuch a scenario, undoubtedly desired by Putin, would fit in well with the panorama of a recomposition of the \"spheres of influence\" negotiated on the basis of the balance of power consolidated for Moscow by the union with Belarus and the success attributed to the CSTO in Kazakhstan in the face of the NATO crisis. It can even be hypothesized that Putin expected his \"political operation\" in Ukraine to be, like the CSTO in Kazakhstan, extremely short and \"effective\".\n\nThe Ukrainian resistance to this scenario failed. Yet Kazakhstan, which plays a central role in the CSTO and its future, does not openly support what has turned into a war. And, like the Chinese ally, it does not want to burn all its cards in the relationship with the West, nor support a loser, let alone accept an even more serious breach than in 2014 of the Budapest Protocol, according to which Moscow respected the borders of new independent states by recovering their nuclear weapons. Significantly, popular protests against the war took place (without repression...) in Kazakhstan and the ruling power displayed neutrality rather than clear support for Russia. [21]\n\nIllustrating the same issue (which could raise the same concerns for Putin), the Chi-nese leader, who is supposed to be his ally, went to Kazakhstan in September. Xi Jinping even explicitly stressed on the first day of his visit to this Central Asian country that he will help Kazakhstan \"safeguard its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity\" [22] - before going to Uzbekistan...\n\nThe war in Ukraine is thus profoundly affecting Russias weight in its environment, far beyond Kazakhstan, as Vicken Cheterian analyses: \"After Russias invasion of Ukraine: a wave of destabilization from the Caucasus to Central Asia\". [23]\n\nThe war in Ukraine retains its Orwellian title of \"military operation\" to minimize its real meaning and evolution. An explicit declaration of war (demanded by far-right hawks in Russia) would be dangerous for Russias internal stability (as was discovered in the recent \"limited\" mobilization); but as has been pointed out here, it would also be problematic for Russias closest allies.\n\nFrom maintaining NATO to building the EU\n\nThe fact remains that for all the currents or countries far from Russia - and often ignorant of the long history of its relations with Ukraine - this discourse against the extension of NATO to Russias doorstep and against US supremacism carries weight. This is true even when the invasion of Ukraine is denounced: it is often presented as reactive or defensive in the face of an Atlantic Alliance built against Russia and in the context of the obvious superiority of the US imperialist regime in economic and military terms. economic and military superiority. Hence a neocampism (supporting the side of any enemy of the main enemy). [24]\n\nWithout sparing Russias aggression, Tony Wood sought to highlight a \"matrix of war\" [25] based on three interacting axes, the United States, NATO and Ukraine. In his introduction, he distinguishes between the \"immediate responsibility\" of Putins Russia in this war, which he condemns, and what he calls a \"historical responsibility\" - that of NATO. But this responsibility is poorly defined. It either comes down to a \"context\" that does not explain a real war, or to pointing to the \"weapons\" (of NATO) that are fighting against Russia - omitting to underline that behind the weapons - and making them more effective than those of the Russian forces - are the choices and motivations of the Ukrainian people. Was it necessary not to resist what is well described as aggression - and if not, with what weapons?\n\nMoreover, many other grey areas and blind spots in the proposed analyses need to be discussed if we are to understand what is at stake in a situation without historical precedent. On the one hand, we have to talk about a concrete war in a concrete situation. And it is rather the open and real crisis of NATO in 2021 - and not a threat of NATO against Russia - that explains the adventurism of the war offensive launched by Putin. Added to this, and also prompting the Russian offensive, are the causes of Putins optimism mentioned above regarding the fragility of Zelensky, the union with Belarus and the success of the CSTO in Kazakhstan. There was no threat to Russia.\n\nFinally, the target and victim of this offensive - and the resistance it met - can only be understood from the neo-colonial imperial Russian content denying Ukraines right to self-determination. The shift to an offensive concretising such a relationship is permitted by the short-term context perceived as favourable by Putin, but it is based (as he himself has explained) on a legitimization that is intended to be historical by including the contestation of Lenins recognition (Putin says the \"creation\") of an independent Ukraine [26]; to this is added an \"anti-Nazi\" argument mobilizing the memory of the Second World War. Again, this is a separate issue from NATO.\n\nBut the concrete analysis of the Atlantic Alliance and its evolution must also be clarified. Putin, like everyone else, knew that its dominant members would not vote for Ukraines membership - precisely in order to protect shared interests with Putin. This point is not a detail. Its omission is part of an outdated and essentialized vision of an anti-Russian NATO that merges and obscures several opaque contexts that can only be briefly mentioned here. On the one hand, Russia is not the USSR (the axis of \"communist\" evil), nor its continuity. And it was the Russian Federation, headed by Yeltsin, which was a key player (along with representatives of Ukraine and Belarus) in the dissolution of the Union combined with the capitalist dismantling of its system welcomed with open arms by the US and the IMF. This was not an external aggression but a choice where historical shifts of an essential part of the former communist nomenklatura were weighing. The scenarios of insertion into capitalist globalization were not the same for the opaque German unification [27], Yeltsins Russia or China - nor for the different countries of the former USSR or Eastern Europe. [28] The new Russian Federation was supported with open arms by the US - including its dirty wars against Chechnya, among others the one led by Putin as part of the ideology of partnership with NATO and its new \"wars of civilizations\" against Islamic terrorism replacing communism.\n\nIndeed, (new) Russia was not the target of NATOs continuation in 1991 and then of the first shifts in its functions (with NATOs first offensive war over Kosovo in 1999). In these two contexts, it is more credible to underline what was Washingtons main concerns: German unification and the (simultaneous) construction of a new European Union incorporating this unified Germany. [29] This was an unforeseen event catalysed by the decision to unify the currency after the fall of the Berlin Wall - a historic fall, without repression on the part of the GDR, because it was supported by Gorbachev who came to negotiate credits with Federal Germany. The USSR leader hoped to build a \"Common European House\" - not without a sympathetic ear from Mitterrand. And while the US (and the UK) wanted to control a unified Germany by incorporating it into NATO, France was negotiating with the new Germany to put an end to the DM and build a new European Union (EU).\n\nAnd it was against this EUs desire for political autonomy and its expansion into Eastern Europe that the United States used NATO operations for its own interests. The Alliance was on the verge of collapse during the first \"strikes\" against Slobodan Milosevics Yugoslavia. [30] The scenario of the three-month war in Kosovo is very different from that in Ukraine. NATOs offensive intervention (without a UN mandate) was supposed to be limited to a few \"strike\". And to avoid the break-up of the Alliance and the worst fiasco, it was necessary to quickly insert the UN Security Council (and thus Russia) into the process of negotiating the end of the war. Its Resolution 1244 - regularly claimed by Milosevic (but not by the Kosovo Albanians) - set up a deeply unstable and corrupt provisional international protectorate.\n\nIt was possible to support the Kosovo Albanians right to self-determination - against the dominance Milosevic wanted to impose - while at the same time radically criticizing the continuation and impasses of the new functions the US was assigning to NATO [31], accompanied by fake news to legitimize them. [32] None of this was a threat to Russia. The provisional choices of alliance of a part of the Kosovo Albanians (the KLA) with the US and NATO did not question the deep root of the (historical and recent concrete) conflict with Belgrade - and thus the issue of self-determination of the Kosovo Albanians. This was expressed in evolving contexts, until the countrys parliament proclaimed independence in 2008 - which to this day has still not been recognized by Belgrade or (therefore) by part of the UN and the EU.\n\nAs in Ukraine, the people of Kosovo have judged the countrys deep corruption and economic disaster, irrespective of global geopolitical issues. And in 2021 an unprecedented mass popular vote in this former province of Serbia marginalized the \"historic\" parties allied with the US by switching to the young left-wing party, \"Self-Determination\": it campaigned on the basis of a radical critique of corruption and in defence of a substantive social agenda - while turning its hopes towards the EU. [33]\n\nUkraine has also applied for membership. How should the (EU-critical) left deal with such a request?\n\nWhat axes of alterglobalist solidarity?\n\nUkraines application for EU membership, the militarization of budgets associated with NATO and the challenges of ecological transition associated with war are the three \"dossiers\" that should be opened and managed urgently, but in a sustainable way, on a European scale and beyond, from an alterglobalist perspective. The magnitude of the combined crises that war aggravates with globalized effects affecting first and foremost the poorest populations requires responses on the same scale. We must face the reality of the divergences and the complexity of the conflicting issues in these various dossiers in a deliberately pluralist perspective in order to try to broaden our horizons (and the different perceptions of the issues according to the regions, countries from which we speak, lived histories), the necessarily unequal knowledge of a complex past and present, in order to bring together the criteria for judgement and the priority objectives - by striving to identify what makes it possible to act in common.\n\nI believe that it is possible and necessary to integrate the three issues mentioned above into a general approach in/against the EU - which could find its place in the revitalization of a public and activist space for European debates as the Altersummit could have been.\n\nDecolonizing approaches to Europe\n\nFirst of all, there should be an awareness of the evils of ignoring a whole \"continent\" - Eastern Europe, in the broad sense, towards Eurasia. The decolonization of analyses and responses involves a semantic struggle. It involves systematically rejecting the assimilation of the EU to \"Europe\" - just as the United States has proclaimed itself \"America\". To the extent that it was proposed to Eastern Europeans to \"join Europe\" and that early radio commentary on the war in Ukraine placed it \"at the gates of Europe\". There are several dimensions to this vocabulary: how can one criticize Europe? Unless one becomes a \"nationalist\"? This was the stigma and choice gen-erally associated with the political upheavals in Eastern Europe. Joining \"Europe\" could only be evidence of progress and civilization compared to \"non-Europe\" (Eastern, or Communist, or Balkan...). I criticized such a vocabulary in the frame-work of the 2012 Zagreb Subversive Forum where Attac intervened, reversing the necessary light from the \"Balkanized\" periphery to criticize the \"civilizing\" practices and vocabulary of the EU towards the Balkans and Eastern Europe: \"The Balkan Social Forum: a chance for another Europe\". [34]\n\nIt is our responsibility - to be shared with our colleagues and comrades in these countries - to take stock of the conditions under which these countries have been exploited (in the context of the dismantling of their system and the dictatorship of the single party), by radical social and fiscal dumping supposed to \"modernize\" and democratize them. [35]\n\nThe fact that such apologetic vocabulary is used by Volodymyr Zelensky in his speeches in the European Parliament does not help to convince those leftists who already tend to ignore Ukraine in their approach to the war. But in this regard, we must distinguish between two aspects: the denunciation of Russias neo-colonial war and the recognition of the right of self-defence of the aggressed country does not depend on the nature of the leadership of that country (and does not require an \"ideal\" country); but we are obviously politically free to decide how we express our solidarity.\n\nFrom this point of view I subscribe and propose to join the European Network of Solidarity with Ukraine [36] which has the following platform:\n\nWe, collectives of social movements, trade unions, organizations and parties, from Eastern and Western Europe, opposed (...) to war and to all neo-colonialism in the world, want to build a network from below, independent of any government FOR :\n\n1/ The defence of an independent and democratic Ukraine!\n\n2. The immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from all Ukrainian territory. The end of the nuclear threat posed by the alerting of Russian nuclear weap-ons and the bombing of Ukrainian power plants!\n\n3. Support for the resistance (armed and unarmed) of the Ukrainian people in its diversity, in defence of its right to self-determination.\n\n4. The cancellation of Ukraines foreign debt!\n\n5. The reception without discrimination of all refugees from Ukraine and else-where!\n\n6. Support for the anti-war and democratic movement in Russia and the guar-antee of political refugee status for opponents of Putin and for Russian sol-diers who desert!\n\n7. Seizure of the assets of Russian government members, senior officials and oligarchs in Europe and around the world; and enforcement of financial and economic sanctions by protecting the disadvantaged from their effects.\n\nBeyond this, we also fight, in conjunction with like-minded currents in Ukraine and Russia:\n\n1. For global nuclear disarmament. Against military escalation and the milita-rization of minds.\n\n2. For the dismantling of military blocs.\n\n3. For any aid to Ukraine to be free from the grip and austerity conditions of the IMF or the EU.\n\n4. Against productivism, militarism and imperialist competition for power and profit that destroy our environment and our social and democratic rights.\n\nAs the beginning of the platform indicates, the network organically integrates (in its meetings, campaigns, debates) components (associations, trade unionists, parties) from Eastern Europe. In practice, priority has been given to links with the socialist NGO Sotsialnyi Rukh [37], trade unionists from Belarus, and components of the Russian left (with campaigns in solidarity with those who oppose or flee the war in Russia). This means that the struggle against the war is combined with several campaigns that can be joined: the demand for the cancellation of the Ukrainian debt that spares the oligarchs and allows the IMF to exert pressure for the dismantling of public ser-vices and the increase of energy tariffs; but also trade union campaigns against the laws that have been proposed and finally adopted, exploiting the context of war to dismantle social rights. Also on the site is the radically critical analysis of the \"reconstruction of Ukraine\" project prepared in the Lugano conference in July 2022, which is geared towards a socially and ecologically disastrous exploitation of Ukraine subordinated to the logic of profit. [38]\n\n\"Should the European left support Ukraines application for EU membership?\" asks a text by an activist from Sotsialnyi Rukh (SR). [39] She answers positively - including from the collective point of view of her organization - to this question. Not without a lucid analysis of what the EU is - and what its effect has been in its eastern and southern peripheries. She writes on this subject: She answers positively - including from the collective point of view of her organization - to this question. Not without a lucid analysis of what the EU is - and what its effect has been in its eastern and southern peripheries. She writes on this subject:\n\nWe can learn from the experience of other countries in Eastern and Southern Europe. Poland, Slovakia and other EU countries have experienced liberaliza-tion in various areas, directly encouraged or tolerated by the EU. In many Eastern European countries, the share of fixed-term contracts increased in the 2000s, while permanent contracts became rarer. At the same time, reforms were implemented to make it easier to dismiss workers, for example, with the argument that this would lead to the creation of new jobs. These developments occurred, albeit unevenly, in all Eastern European countries and were accel-erated by crises such as the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a deepening of neoliberal policies in the EU and globally. It is also worth mentioning the role of the European Central Bank in promoting fiscal conservatism and its conse-quences on the welfare of the population, which we have seen in the example of Greece.\n\nSo why support EU membership?\n\nThe question is actually outdated, but interesting to discuss. Outdated because the official application for membership was submitted, and four months later - last June - the 27 accepted Ukraine and Moldova as official candidates. But the question remains interesting because \"candidate\" status does not imply actual membership. It opens a long negotiation process - from which some of the Balkan countries have still not emerged for years: from the former Yugoslavia, only Slovenia and Croatia have been integrated. All the other republics are waiting for the process to be com-pleted (and it is partly on the back burner for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo). Representatives from the Western Balkans would find it difficult to accept that Ukraine would be integrated more quickly than them.\n\nSo the real question is the terms of integration - what is being \"negotiated\"? And does the left have any solidarity campaigns to run on this front. What does our Ukrainian comrade say about this?\n\nOn the one hand she points out that it is possible to exploit the solidarity expressed towards Ukraine in the face of war to forcefully legitimize specific conditions granted to the country:\n\nThe EU should admit Ukraine under conditions that guarantee the possibility of a social and egalitarian reconstruction and not create obstacles to it (...) European competition law and the radical restriction of protectionist policies create significant obstacles to a social and progressive reconstruction of Ukraine. Exceptions to these laws should therefore be made for Ukraine. This would not be the first case of this kind. Countries like Denmark have even joined the Union with special conditions that have created exceptions to other laws.\n\nShe furthermore points out that neo-liberal policies have been promoted in Ukraine without EU membership - and in particular within the framework of the \"Eastern Partnership\". Membership would at least confer rights and would not be worse than absolute peripheralization without rights.\n\nMoreover, she says, for the Ukrainian people\n\nEU membership is of great symbolic importance - it has been the main goal of the countrys foreign policy since 2014. Opposing it would be very unpopular and would require clear equivalent alternatives that do not currently exist.\n\nShe believes that European rights are in some areas more progressive than Ukraines, and therefore that EU integration favours the fight for social advances. Most importantly:\n\nintegration can facilitate the networking of local organizations like Sotsialnyi Rukh with other left-wing actors and lead to the development of long-term re-lationships - which, in turn, can ensure that attention to the problems in Ukraine does not remain tied to the events of the crisis.\n\nIn fact this is what the European left should be building - European links with the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkans for campaigns for common rights and goals. And for an overhaul of the terms of membership. In doing so, what is needed is a questioning of the existing treaties, their ongoing modifications (without a constituent process) and the policies implemented in the face of the major intertwined crises: environmental, financial (since 2008 - what transformations and banking fra-gilities) and political (effects of the ongoing war).\n\nAid to Ukraine does not imply the militarization of budgets: for the submission of the budgetary and military policies of each country to the control of the society.\n\nIt is essential to be able to defend a policy of solidarity with the (armed and unarmed) resistance of Ukraine against a murderous neo-colonial aggression, and to keep an independent and critical judgement on the policies of our governments. I have explicitly quoted the platform of the European Solidarity Network Ukraine (ENSU). I repeat its last points:\n\n1. For global nuclear disarmament.\n\n2. Against military escalation and the militarization of minds. For the disman-tling of military blocs\n\n3. For any aid to Ukraine to be free from the grip and austerity conditions of the IMF or the EU.\n\n4. Against productivism, militarism and imperialist competition for power and profit that destroy our environment and our social and democratic rights.\n\nBut the way to fight for these goals requires breaking down a \"globalizing\" and essentialist approach to NATO and aid and distinguishing between several issues that should be debated in order to develop a globalized platform \"for a just and lasting peace\":\n\nNATO should have been dissolved with the Warsaw Pact in 1991. Its continuation and the evolution of its functions (from a defensive alliance to an offensive alliance and intervening anywhere) have been neither transparent nor democratic processes. The assessment of its interventions should be made in each country involved. But the same goes for all military pacts: we must oppose the logic of sharing spheres of influence based on permanent pacts that poorly disguise relation-ships of domination.\n\nAll armies should be returned to their home territory and placed under the control of the countries concerned. This would open up a concrete process of demilitarization - and the case-by-case judgement of military aid for causes deemed just. Within this framework, the armed forces of a country can also be involved by international agreement in peacekeeping action outside their territory - under the control of the UN or the countries concerned.\n\nThe war in Ukraine was launched by Russia. Aid to Ukraine does not turn the war into an inter-imperialist war. Defence aid to Ukraine is legitimate and should remain under the control of the Ukrainian people and their choice of negotiating conditions.\n\nEvery population in every country should be able to control what budgets are actually allocated to Ukraine and other goals and conflicts: a progressive global anti-war movement cannot equate a dominant countrys war of aggression with an aggressed countrys defensive war. A just struggle - with arms in hand against armed aggression - must be defended, even if one also recognizes conscientious objection and the possible choice of non-violent resistance. but this choice belongs to the people and peoples under attack.\n\nThe reconstitution of an autocratic state and regime in Russia with military and imperial interventionist dimensions poses obvious security problems for the countries close to Russia and the populations of the federation likely to revolt against relations of domination. This was the case in Chechnya. The fact that the countries concerned perceive (rightly or wrongly) NATO as a protective framework makes it impossible for the left to mobilize for the dissolution of NATO as long as this threatening situation from Russia continues. But this does not mean that there is no need to criticize NATOs plans and the expansion of its budgets.\n\nFrom sanctions against the Putin regime to European environmental policies.\n\nThe climate emergency and solidarity against this war should be combined with our criticism of the EU: the Putin regime feeds its aggressive policies on the income from fossil fuels. Sanctions on Russian imports must at the same time accelerate the process of energy transition - and thus obviously reject the increase of fossil fuel production elsewhere, and in particular the deployment of liquefied natural gas production and distribution.\n\nAt the same time, this policy requires the protection of social rights and jobs - implying a vast pan-European project of planning reconversions and investments in re-newable energies. This could be addressed to the populations of all European countries - including Russia, on condition that the war stops.\n\nUtopia? Lets turn it into a \"real utopia\" - and \"if they wont let us dream, lets make sure they dont sleep\"...\n\nThe initial version of this article was written in French for the on-line [Revue Les Possibles-> https://france.attac.org/IMG/pdf/samary-possibles_34.pdf, Attac, winter 2022.",

                "cc_text": "SECRETARY BLINKEN: Very good to see everyone here this afternoon.\n\nIn the first year of our administration, we focused on rebuilding and revitalizing Americas alliances and partnerships, weaving them together as well in new coalitions of common purpose. As you all saw, we reinvigorated our engagement with NATO, with the European Union, the United Nations, the G7, ASEAN, the OECD. We elevated and strengthened the Quad. We created AUKUS, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, among many other groupings.\n\nThe logic here was simple and straightforward: Were in a fundamentally stronger position to address the issues that actually affect the lives of the American people when we do so alongside the many countries that share our fundamental interests and values.\n\nIn year two, we showed why this was a smart and important investment. Whether we were addressing threats and risks posed by strategic competitors, combating global challenges like the climate crisis and the pandemic, or seizing opportunities to improve Americans lives in tangible ways, our alliances and our partnerships proved the vital difference.\n\nWe kept up a pretty relentless pace of broadening and deepening our engagement across the world, hosting the Summit of the Americas, the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit, the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit.\n\nWe drew enormous power as well as credibility from unprecedented investments in our economic strength and technological edge here at home the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nSo, today, what I wanted to spend a few minutes doing, with your tolerance, is to highlight four of the most consequential areas where diplomacy delivered in 2022.\n\nFirst, we rallied the world to ensure that Russias war on Ukraine is a strategic failure. Since February 24th, weve brought together dozens of allies and partners to promote security, economic and humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people as they stand up for their countrys democracy, its sovereignty, and its independence. Our collective support including now an additional $1.85 billion in U.S. military assistance the President announced yesterday has enabled Ukraines fighters to go on the counter-offensive, liberating their people, retaking more of their territory.\n\nNATO has never been stronger or more united. The Alliance adopted a new Strategic Concept and added more forces and resources to our collective defense. We doubled the number of battlegroups along NATOs eastern flank. Weve increased deployments in the Baltics. Were on the cusp of adding Finland and Sweden as new members of the Alliance.\n\nWe worked with allies and partners to impose the strongest-ever sanctions and export controls on President Putin and those enabling his war of aggression significantly diminishing the Russian militarys access to funds, to goods, to technologies that are critical to the war effort. By any measure, the Russian war machine is in dire straits. U.S. diplomatic leadership has been indispensable in building and maintaining this unity of purpose and also this unity of action. Meanwhile, we brought our diplomatic muscle to bear on isolating Russia at the United Nations and other international organizations, and to reaffirming global support for the core principles of the UN Charter that President Putin is trying to shed.\n\nNow, we know that a tough winter lies ahead for Ukrainians, as President Putin pursues his new strategy of trying to freeze Ukrainian men, women, children, the elderly to death. Were working with the G7 and other allies and partners to repair, to replace, and defend Ukraines energy infrastructure, including bolstering its advanced air defense through precision systems like the Patriot missile battery that President Biden announced yesterday.\n\nWe are with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Thats the message President Biden delivered personally to President Zelenskyy when he hosted him at the White House. Its a commitment backed up by robust and enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress, which was on full display last night.\n\nMaintaining that support is crucial, because President Putin continues to show no interest in meaningful diplomacy. We agree with President Zelenskyy that diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russias war. Until President Putin changes course, the best way to improve the prospects of a just and durable peace, to actually advance the prospects for meaningful diplomacy, is sustaining our strong support for Ukraine.\n\nSecond, we accelerated strategic convergence with our allies and partners on the Peoples Republic of China. This is crucial, for while Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, the PRC is our only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.\n\nBack in May, I set out our strategy to meet the challenge posed by the PRC: invest in the foundations of our strength at home; align with our partners and allies; compete with China so that we can defend our interests and realize our vision for the future. Our diplomacy has played a key role in carrying out that strategy.\n\nWe set out an affirmative approach for a free and open Indo-Pacific that draws on the views of many of our partners inside and outside the region, and that has in turn informed their own strategies. Together with the European Union we strengthened our complementary toolkits on key challenges posed by the PRC, from economic coercion to human rights. Weve deepened our cooperation on investment screening and export controls of sensitive and emerging technologies.\n\nFor the first time, NATOs Strategic Concept committed to address the PRCs systemic challenges to transatlantic security. We deepened the Alliances coordination with Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and our other Pacific allies.\n\nWere united in our commitment to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and we continue to raise concerns and take joint action around the PRCs human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet, the erosion of freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong.\n\nEven as we competed vigorously with the PRC, weve worked carefully to prevent our competition from veering into conflict. Well continue to manage this relationship responsibly, building on the candid and productive discussion President Biden and President Xi had in Bali a conversation I look forward to advancing when I visit the PRC early next year. And well continue to pursue cooperation on issues that demand that the United States and China work together for the good of our people, but also for the good of people around the world.\n\nThird, we mobilized broad-based coalitions to deliver solutions to the shared global challenges that so many of us face, including on food security, on health, energy and climate, inclusive economic growth challenges that have a real impact on the lives and the livelihoods of the American people, and that we cannot solve effectively alone.\n\nWe led the global response to an unprecedented global food security crisis driven by COVID, climate, and conflict worsened significantly by President Putins war.\n\nIn 2022 alone, we contributed $11 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance. We hosted a Food Security Ministerial and summit with the African Union and the European Union to marshal the resources needed to save lives in the immediate, but also to help countries build their own capacity for resilient, sustainable agricultural production.\n\nWe made significant strides in ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic providing nearly $20 billion for the global response, distributing more than 670 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to over 115 countries.\n\nWe launched and led the Global Action Plan, which brought together dozens of countries to get shots in arms, to bolster health supply systems, to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\nWe also took steps to ensure that the world is better prepared to prevent, to detect, and respond to future outbreaks. We worked with the G20 to create a new World Bank fund to help countries strengthen their pandemic preparedness. We will train 500,000 health workers over the next five years across our own hemisphere in Latin America. Well invest $4 billion in health workers in Africa by 2025.\n\nOn climate, we leveraged historic investments at home and abroad to accelerate the clean energy transition and adapt to the effects of a warming climate. This is not just our responsibility; we also see it as a once-in-generations opportunity to create good-paying jobs for Americans.\n\nWe forged new regional partnerships to make our economies more resilient, more sustainable, more prosperous, more inclusive including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, whose members represent 40 percent of global GDP, and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.\n\nTogether with the G7, we launched the $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, to develop a high-standard, transparent alternative for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nFourth, we used the power of American diplomacy to advance peace and prevent and mitigate conflict. Together with my counterparts from Israel, Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, I took part in the historic Negev Summit to advance integration and normalization in the Middle East.\n\nWe brokered a historic agreement between Israel and Lebanon to resolve their long-standing maritime boundary dispute. We supported African-led talks that led to the cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Tigrayan forces. We helped bring about a framework agreement to put Sudan back on the path toward civilian-led democracy. We helped secure and later extend a truce in the Yemen conflict.\n\nAnd we brought home unjustly detained Americans from Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Burma, Afghanistan, Haiti, and other countries. We will keep working every single day to bring home Americans who are wrongfully detained around the world, while taking steps to deter and prevent this abhorrent practice going forward.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to use all of our diplomatic tools to drive these priorities, and many others including maintaining our commitment to the people of Afghanistan, particularly those who supported the U.S. mission there over 20 years, as well as to stand up for the rights of women and girls.\n\nWe will also be intensely focused on coordinating international efforts to combat the scourge of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.\n\nNow, I focused a lot on how weve worked with allies and partners in 2022 to confront todays biggest challenges. But even as we did that, we also took major steps here in this building to ensure that the State Department is positioned and empowered to meet todays challenges, and tomorrows.\n\nWe launched a new Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy. We notified Congress of our intent to create a new Bureau on Global Health Security and Diplomacy. We stood up a China House to lead the development and coordination of our policy toward the PRC. We expanded our diplomatic presence in the Indo-Pacific, and brought on the biggest cohort of Foreign and Civil Service officers in over a decade. And we made significant strides toward attracting and retaining a workforce that reflects one of our nations greatest strengths our diversity.\n\nBefore I conclude, I want to acknowledge the \"we\" behind all of the hard-earned progress that weve made. That starts with the individuals who make up the Department of State, particularly our Foreign and Civil Service officers, our locally employed staff. Theyre the ones who executed on this vision day in, day out. And not just on the issues I highlighted today, but across every facet of our foreign policy working together with our colleagues from across the U.S. Government, working as well with our foreign partners.\n\nI could not be prouder of my teammates. I also couldnt be more humbled by the opportunity to serve alongside them. To all of them, to their families, whose love and support and sacrifice allows them to provide this service, I simply want to say thank you.\n\nI also want to thank Congress for its partnership. By our count, the department had more than 3,200 briefings, meetings, and calls with Congress over the past year. I personally participated in more than 60 of those.\n\nIm especially grateful to members of both parties who have worked with us to confirm 91 nominees this year a tally we hope to add to in the weeks ahead. Because when we have our team on the field, we deliver.\n\nFinally, Id like to thank all of you, the members of our press corps. The work that you do is indispensable to our democracy. And while its not always easy answering your questions, the accurate information that you provide is a public good. Its as basic and as simple as that. It helps our citizens understand the forces that are shaping their lives. It empowers them to engage meaningfully in their communities, their country, the world. Its one of the reasons that we fight so hard for a free and independent media around the globe, and its why Im deeply grateful to you for the work that you do.\n\nWhen I first started in this job, many people were asking if America would or even could lead again around the world. Or, for that matter, whether the world wanted us to.\n\nIn 2022, I think we answered those questions. We showed that the United States is ready and able to lead on the fundamental challenges of our time. And countries around the world demonstrated why they want to be our partners in building a world thats more free, more open, more secure, and more prosperous.\n\nWith that, I thank you. Im happy to take some questions.\n\nMR PRICE: Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Thanks, Mr. Secretary. Merry Christmas and\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: happy holidays, and I hope the lovely weather doesnt interfere with any travel plans that you might have. You in honor of the new year I have 23 questions. (Laughter.) But in deference to everyone, Ill condense it to one so.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So your questions 23 parts. Is that it?\n\nQUESTION: No, no, no. Not even 23 parts. But youll see. So in your year-end review of 2022, you mentioned a number of issues Russia, China, Afghanistan. You didnt mention Iran and North Korea, which are which were big issues this year and will continue to be, along with those other three. So when you talk about these challenges which were facing, which youre going to face in the upcoming year, you often say that the ball is in their court, that youve made a proposal, they need to respond. Im wondering if there are any Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan in which you could see the ball being in your court. In other words, any are there any of them in which you can see the administration making fresh, new initiatives or proposing new ideas to resolve some of these problems, which are dramatic, to say the least?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank, Matt, very much. First, I think its fair to say to atrociously mix a metaphor that the balls been in our court and weve been running with it, by which I mean this take Russia, Ukraine. From the outset of this aggression, from even before the conflict, we were very clear, including with the Russians, that if they proceeded with the aggression we would do three things. We would work day in, day to support Ukraine and rally the world to do the same; we would impose severe costs on Russia for its actions; we would strengthen the Alliance that we have to defend us and defend our partners in Europe, NATO.\n\nWe have done and we continue to do day in, day out, exactly what we said. And thats not sitting back and waiting for someone to hit the ball at us. It is us, every single day, with our diplomacy because this stuff doesnt just happen making good on those commitments.\n\nWhen it comes to China, one of the things that we set out to do and its laid out in our strategy, as I said was both to invest in ourselves, to align with our allies and partners, and then to compete vigorously where we disagree. And thats exactly what weve done and what we continue to do every single day. The convergence that we built, the convergence that is stronger and greater than any time that Ive seen it between the United States and Europe, the United States and Asia, and increasingly countries around the world on how to approach the challenge that China poses thats what were working on every single day.\n\nAnd as I mentioned a few minutes ago, in area after area, we are more aligned than weve been. Were approaching this in similar ways, often the same ways. And again, that is the product of active, proactive, engaged American diplomacy.\n\nI can go down the board. The common denominator here is that all of these areas we have been running with the ball. But it started with something that remains to me foundational, and that was the decision that we made, at the Presidents instruction on day one, to reinvigorate, to re-energize, to rejuvenate, to re-engage, and in some cases to reinvent these alliances and partnerships. The fundamental premise that we have is, one, as Ive and youve heard me say this a bunch of times, but it bears repeating one, the world doesnt organize itself. And if we are not out there if the United States is not out there leading, engaging, helping to do the organizing, then either someone else is going to do it or no one does it either way, probably not good for us.\n\nBut second, and the flip side of the same coin, is that virtually all these problems to be effectively resolved require other countries in on the deal, require us to coordinate, to cooperate. Thats where American diplomacy has been playing a leading role. Every single one of these issues and again, when it comes to other issues that youve mentioned Iran, North Korea, et cetera weve not been sitting back. Weve been leaning in, but ultimately other countries have to make decisions about what theyre going to do or not do.\n\nWe continue to believe, for example, on Irans nuclear program that the best way to deal with this challenge, to deal with this threat is through diplomacy. Weve been engaged in intense diplomacy. But if Iran is not willing or able to do whats necessary to get back into compliance, well, thats part of the equation too.\n\nMR PRICE: Michele.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, I want to pick up on this issue of alliances. Because the Biden administration came under a lot of criticism, including from allies, for its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. I wonder if there were lessons learned that are that have been useful to you in managing these alliances, now in dealing with Russia and China. And then also, just briefly, what, if anything, can the U.S. do now to support the women of Afghanistan?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So second part first. The decision that we just heard come from the Taliban on denying opportunities for women to go to universities, girls to go to school I think what youve already heard is a course of condemnation from around the world, and not only from us but from countries virtually every continent, including Muslim countries, which, I think is, in and of itself, important and powerful. What theyve done is to try to sentence Afghan women and girls to a dark future without opportunity. And the bottom line is that no country is going to be able to succeed, much less thrive, if it denies half its population the opportunity to contribute.\n\nAnd to be clear and we are engaged with other countries on this right now there are going to be costs if this is not reversed, if this is not changed. Im not going to detail them today, but we will pursue them in coordination with allies and partners. And I can tell you as well that any prospect that the Taliban seeks for improved relations with the world, with the international community, which is something that they want and we know that they need that is not going to happen if they continue on this course.\n\nMore broadly when it comes to Afghanistan, of course, as weve said, we have to learn the lessons of Afghanistan over the 20 years of the mission there, as well as the last year. I have to say and if you go back and look at, for example, what the NATO Secretary General said and others have said, our consultation with allies and partners on Afghanistan in the moment were sustained, they were intense, and we strongly took note of everything that we heard from allies and partners in advance of the decisions that President Biden made and that we made. So I think this notion that we hear from some about a lack of consultation is actually not born out by the facts and also not born out by what many of our allies and partners have said.\n\nIll also say this: we ended Americas longest war. For the first time in 20 years, Americans will not be coming home from Afghanistan in a body bag or grievously injured. We brought more than 120,000 people out of the country. When it comes to Russias war against Ukraine, if we were still in Afghanistan, it would have, I think, made much more complicated the support that weve been able to give and that others have been able to give Ukraine to resist and push back against the Russian aggression. We heard predictions that leaving Afghanistan would result in a tsunami of refugees of Afghanistan. That, to date, has not happened. Weve heard that it would result in more terrorism. That to date has not happened. And on the contrary, we were able to take out one of the leading terrorists, Mr. al-Zawahiri.\n\nAnd so I think putting all of this in perspective is very important. Putting it in the perspective of 20 years, putting it in the perspective of the last year, putting in the perspective of what has happened since that does not take away from our enduring commitment to make sure that we help those who helped us in Afghanistan. It doesnt take away from our enduring commitment to stand up for the rights of women and girls, and more broadly for the rights of people in Afghanistan. It doesnt take away from our enduring commitment to help as the leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. All that remains very much on our plates as we go forward.\n\nMR PRICE: Kylie.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thanks for doing this, Secretary. I wanted to point to something that you said earlier this month on Ukraine. You said the Biden administration is working to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to take back its territory thats been seized since February 24th. Im wondering if you had a sense in the private discussions with President Zelenskyy yesterday if thats something that Ukraine could agree to as an end state, because it does seem at odds with what Zelenskyy stated as what a just peace would look like.\n\nAnd then we just heard from the NSCs John Kirby that Bidens team is going to work with President Zelenskyys team on looking at that peace proposal that they put forth. Im wondering what the goal of that review is. Do you want to put forth a renewed peace plan that has the backing of the U.S. alongside Ukraine?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Good. Thanks, Kylie, very much. First, whats clear from all of our conversations with Ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between President Biden and President Zelenskyy, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free, an independent, a prosperous and democratic Ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the United Nations Charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence. And thats something the President reiterated yesterday.\n\nWeve also been very clear that fundamentally these decisions are for Ukrainians to make. They have to decide where theyre going, how theyre trying to get there, when theyre trying to get there, of course with our very, very strong support. So fundamentally, theyre the ones who are going to be making these decisions. What weve heard from the Ukrainians in recent months is the intense focus on getting back territory in the east and in the south that was principally seized since February. Thats where their focus has been. But that doesnt prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles. Again, these are decisions for them to make.\n\nWhat we want and what many other countries around the world want is a peace, ultimately, that, as weve said, is just and durable. And by \"just,\" one that doesnt simply ratify another country seizing by force the territory of another; \"durable\" in the sense that we want to make sure that it holds and that were not simply putting Ukraine in a position where Russia is going to repeat what it did a month, six months, a year later. All of those elements are very important to what we factor in.\n\nWhen it comes to the peace proposal, I think heres whats important: President Zelenskyy has made repeatedly clear that this is going to end when it ends through diplomacy, through a negotiation, and hes put forward some ideas, some principles, some particular issues around which hopefully countries can come together to try to advance that proposition. But fundamentally, right now Russia has shown no interest in meaningful diplomacy, in meaningfully engaging to bring this war to an end. As President Biden said, that could happen tomorrow if Putin withdrew his forces, but thats not going to happen. And in the absence of that, we have to see some meaningful evidence that Russia is prepared to actually negotiate and negotiate, again, a just and durable peace. We just havent seen that.\n\nIn our judgment, the best way to actually advance getting to that day is to sustain our support for Ukraine, to make sure that it does well on the battlefield; that it continues to have the support it needs to sustain itself against the Russian onslaught, including against its energy infrastructure; as well as economic support. That is what is most likely to speed up the day when President Putin comes to the conclusion that what hes engaged in is futile and that its time for a genuine negotiation. I think President Zelenskyys proposals are a good start at that. Were talking to countries around about those proposals. Theyre things that everyone should be able to in one way or another to rally to.\n\nQUESTION: But whats the goal of reviewing that peace plan they put forward, and how long will that take?\n\nMR PRICE: Kylie, well move around a bit. Humeyra, go ahead.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Im sorry, whats\n\nQUESTION: How long is it going to take for Biden administration officials to work with Zelenskyys team to review that proposal that hes put forward?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, I dont want to put a timeline on anything, but I can just tell you that were looking at what hes put forward. I was just on the I was going to say on the phone on the video with our G7 partners this morning, and this is one of the things that we talked about. So I think countries around the world are looking at this and theyre seeing that, again, the Ukrainians want look, no one wants peace more than President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine. Theyre the ones who are suffering from the aggression. But it has to be just and it has to be durable.\n\nMR PRICE: Humeyra.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ned. Hello, Mr. Secretary. I just want to go to China. So at the moment, there is an uncontrolled COVID outbreak there since the reversal of their \"Zero COVID\" policy, and many countries, including the United States, have expressed concern over it and they said they could help. I just want to zero in on that. Has the United States in recent weeks or since the reversal of policy offered China to provide them with vaccines? What was their response? And since the authorities there have changed the criteria to calculate COVID deaths, how accurate do you find Chinas official figures on casualties? Thanks.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: First, let me say this. We want to see China get this outbreak under control for three reasons. First, we dont want to see people anywhere suffering from COVID. Whether its illness, whether its death, we want to see that come to an end wherever its happening, including in China.\n\nSecond, any time the virus is spreading or is moving around, there is the possibility that a new variant develops, that variant spreads even further, and it comes and hits us or hits other countries around the world. So we have a clear interest in that.\n\nAnd then, as weve seen, there are clear implications for the global economy with China being shut down because of COVID.\n\nSo on all of those levels a basic humanitarian level, the concern for everyones health, as well as for the global economy its profoundly in our interest that China do whats necessary to get ahead of this. At the same time, its also very important for all countries, including China, to focus on people getting vaccinated, making testing and treatment available, and, importantly, sharing information with the world about what theyre experiencing again, because it has implications not just for China but for the entire world. So we would like to see that happening.\n\nWere the largest donor of vaccines, as you know. Were prepared to continue to support people around the world, including in China, with this and with other COVID-related health support. China has not asked to date for that help, but, again, were fully prepared to provide assistance to anyone who asks for it if they think its useful.\n\nMR PRICE: Farhad.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Secretary, for taking our questions. You just mentioned right now that for the Iran nuclear deal, diplomacy is still the best option, while at the same time you are saying that the focus is the Iranian people asking or seeking their right. How can you like, what sort of message are you sending to the Iranian people who are being repressed right now? And then the U.S. is going for a deal with a government that was the only government outside Russia that was yesterday mentioned by President Zelenskyy, a few meters away from here, saying that they are doing a terrorist action by providing drones. How can you add this up for the people of Iran?\n\nAnd also, what message do you have for the families of Emad Shargi, Morad Tahbaz, Siamak Namazi, and the green card holder Shahab Dalili?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: So a couple of things on this. First, I think the world has been intensely focused on whats happening throughout Iran. We remain gravely concerned about Iranian authorities firing on peaceful protestors, notably on women, on children. Weve seen mass arrests. Weve seen sham trials. Weve seen executions. Weve seen use of sexual violence as a tool for protest suppression. Not only us, the eyes of the world have seen this. And these human rights abuses are not going and will not go without consequence.\n\nWeve been working from even before the this repression to sanction those who are engaged in trying to repress the Iranian people, and just yesterday, I believe, we issued new sanctions, including on the prosecutor general of Iran. At the same time, as youve heard me discuss, weve been working to try to make sure that Iranians have in their hands the ability to communicate with each other, to remain connected with the outside world. Weve been working on that and with partners, with allies, with countries around the world, including at the United Nations, we have worked to continue to hold Iran accountable and to condemn it for its actions.\n\nSo that is happening. That is ongoing. And that is the focus of so many countries around the world. At the same time, were intensely focused on the fact that Iran has provided UAVs to Russia to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine, and in particular, to attack civilian infrastructure. These Iranian drones are what is being used, among other things, to try to turn off the lights, turn off the heat, turn off the water for Ukrainians as they head into winter. And were putting a spotlight on that and, again, trying to take actions wherever we can to disrupt that, including sanctioning the various UAV networks that Iran is engaged in.\n\nOther countries also are focused on this. Weve shared information at the United Nations on Irans actions, which we see as a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231. We think its a clear violation and were urging an investigation of that.\n\nSo on all of these fronts as well as the many other areas where Iran is engaging in destabilizing activities, dangerous activities, support for terrorist groups, destabilizing actions throughout the region, weve been focused and engaged. That also does not take away from the proposition that it is profoundly in our interest that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon. And President Biden is committed to ensuring that Iran not acquire a nuclear weapon. Weve continued to believe that the most effective way, the most durable way to do that was through diplomacy.\n\nAnd when the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, was actually enforced, it did exactly what it was designed to do. It put Irans nuclear program in a box. It was verified not only by international inspectors, it was verified by our own people, Irans compliance with that, including by the previous administration. And in our judgment, it was a grievous mistake to pull out of that agreement and to let Irans nuclear program out of the box. But thats the reality that we inherited and that weve had to deal with.\n\nSo on the diplomacy, again, as I said, we think thats the best solution. But despite the efforts that weve made, even as weve been pushing back against Irans other egregious actions, despite the efforts that weve made and our partners in Europe have made, Iran has not been willing or able to do whats necessary to come back into compliance with the agreement. So we will continue to look and act on ways to make sure that, one way or another, Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\n\nMR PRICE: Sean.\n\nQUESTION: And the families?\n\nQUESTION: Sure. Could I ask you about the Middle East, elsewhere in the Middle East? Theres a formation of the government in Israel to Benjamin Netanyahu is going to be the prime minister again. You, yourself, gave a speech to J Street where you mentioned concerns about some potential actions, such as annexation, such as settlements. You mentioned that you that youre going to deal with policies, not with personalities. Nonetheless, some of the personalities in the government have called for measures like this.\n\nBut how is the United States going to deal with that? Is there going to be are you going to deal with these specific players in the government who may have backgrounds that are problematic? And in terms of the Arab world, through the Abraham Accords you mentioned the Negev Summit. To what extent can you leverage that to perhaps to send a message to the new Israeli government?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Right. So first I want to extend congratulations to Prime Minister Netanyahu on announcing the formation of a new government. The Knesset still has to approve it, as you know, before it can be formally sworn in. But we look forward to working with Israel to advance both the interests and the values that have been long been at the heart of our relationship, and also to promoting a broader approach to try to bring equal measures of security, of opportunity, of prosperity, of dignity to Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\nTheres been no secret about our approach. And again, I reiterated that in the remarks I made to J Street just a few weeks ago. And as you noted, what I said then, what I repeat now, is that going forward just as in the past previous administrations on the Israeli side, on the American side, what previous American administrations have done we will engage with and judge our partners in Israel on the basis of the policies they pursue, not the personalities that happen to form the government.\n\nI think weve demonstrated over successive Israeli governments and over successive American administrations, precisely because we have a rock-solid partnership and one that is committed to Israels security, that we can have very candid conversations when we disagree. Thats not going to change, either.\n\nQUESTION: May I follow up, Ned?\n\nMR PRICE: Courtney.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Secretary, happy holidays.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: The administration has maintained its position on diplomacy with North Korea over its missile program even as Pyongyangs provocations have increased in both frequency and severity. And now the White House has confirmed North Koreas transfer of weapons to Wagner Group. Im just wondering, what does running with the ball look like in 2023? What is the outlook for the new year? Are you seeing it as being time to change course? And are when you talk about alliances, are the U.S., Republic of Korea, and Japan agreed on how to proceed? Thanks.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Were in not only close communication and coordination, I think were in very tight synchronization with the Republic of Korea and with Japan on the approach to North Korea. In fact, I think that alignments not been stronger in recent years. So were working together every single day.\n\nAnd when it comes to running with the ball, this is not only a question of condemning what North Koreas done and continues to do the egregious violations of UN Security Council resolutions, the provocative actions, the threat to peace and security not only sanctioning these acts, as we continue to do, and bringing them to the United Nations, we continue to take actions to shore up our own defensive and deterrent capabilities and capacities, including working ever more closely with Japan, with Korea on exercises, on preparedness, making sure that we and they have the systems in place to deter and ultimately defend against any North Korean aggression. All of that is ongoing.\n\nAnd Id also note that the sanctions that we have put in place and that were working to strongly enforce have put some constraints on North Koreas ability to continue to advance its missile and nuclear programs. Nonetheless, they are were Im not going to predict or preview where this is going in 2023, except to say that quite literally every single day we are working with our allies and partners to make sure that not only are we putting pressure on North Korea to end these practices, but were making sure that were putting in place what is needed to deter aggression directly against any of our partners, as well as against us, and if necessary defend against it.\n\nLet me just add that China has an important role to play in this. It has the strongest, deepest relationship of any country in the world with North Korea. I think its in Chinas interest not to see these kind of provocative actions continue. And we have conversations with China; this is something President Xi and President Biden talked about. I expect Ill continue that conversation when I get to China early next year, about what we hope that China will do to try to convince North Korea to move in another direction.\n\nWe have said very clearly, and it remains the case, that were open to diplomacy without any preconditions. We remain committed to seeing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. To date, North Koreas not engaged on that basis, but that remains a possibility. And I think China can play a role in helping to move things in that direction.\n\nMR PRICE: One final question. Missy.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks, Mr. Secretary. The Biden administration has promised to put human rights at the center of its foreign policy, and I understand Ive heard from you and from other senior members of the Biden administration that human rights is always part of the conversation but is obviously not the only concern when the United States deals with its partners and another any country. Looking back at the last two years, how well do you think the administration has done in getting the mix right and effectively using American leverage and influence to actually get results when it comes to human rights? And if there are any specific examples of where you think the United States has done well or not so well, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Sure. As you said, very rightly, first, its something that President Biden felt very strongly about putting back at the center of our foreign policy, and weve done that. Weve done that in shining a spotlight on human rights abuses. Weve done that in rallying other countries to speak out, stand up, and take action against these abuses. Weve done that in the actions that weve taken ourselves.\n\nAt the same time, again, as you rightly said, its at the heart of our foreign policy; its not the totality of our foreign policy. Its one of the critical elements that we look at and try to advance, but in every instance we have to balance a multiplicity of interests. And at the same time, we have to make judgments about what is ultimately the most effective way to try and advance our commitment to human rights. And most of this, as with a lot of the things we do, are not like flipping a light switch. A lot of this is turning an aircraft carrier, and it takes time and it takes relentless effort.\n\nI mentioned earlier that we have greater convergence than Ive seen in my experience with our closest allies and partners in Europe, as well as in Asia, on China. I think you see that playing out, for example, when it comes to human rights abuses that are being committed by China, whether its in Xinjiang, Tibet, other places, including for example in growing convergence on export controls not only going to the most sensitive technologies that might help China advance its military capacity, but also technology that could be used for the surveillance of people and other tools of repression against the rights of minorities and others in China.\n\nSame thing in a number of other countries. Similarly, weve taken steps and others have taken steps with us to try to help ensure that products that are made with forced labor in countries dont come into our own country or to other countries.\n\nThere are lots of places where weve seen human rights abuses committed in the context of larger conflicts. One way to make sure that were actually getting at the upholding of human rights and the end of abuse is to try to resolve those conflicts. Yemen is an example of a place where weve invested tremendously in support of diplomacy to try to end the conflict. And for all of the fragility, we had a ceasefire that was extended. And even though its now not been formally extended another time, in practice its holding. Thats a lot of humanitarian assistance to get to people. Its also seen, I think, a reduction in abuses committed against civilians.\n\nSimilarly in Ethiopia, where weve labored in close partnership with African countries, including the African Union, but also including countries like Kenya, the practical effect of getting a cessation of hostilities, of getting the guns quiet, of getting humanitarian assistance into Tigray has also been to reduce, if not eliminate, the human rights abuses that were being committed as the conflict was raging. And were focused now on making sure that we can get independent human rights monitors into Tigray to verify that there are no ongoing atrocities, even as were looking for accountability for whats already taken place.\n\nIn Ukraine, where we see human rights abuses being committed on an almost daily basis by Russian forces, weve put a bright spotlight on that. Not only have we put a spotlight on it, weve been working overtime to help collect the evidence and gather the information of these abuses. Were engaged across the international community, whether its with the UN, whether its with the International Criminal Court, whether its looking at other mechanisms to make sure that not only is that information and evidence gathered, but that at the end of the day there will be accountability for these human rights abuses. And thats one way, as we put a spotlight on it, to deter it.\n\nSo I think there are many other places where, in one way or another, the combination of putting a spotlight on something, taking concrete action, getting others to do the same is making a difference. But the reality, of course, is that we continue to see abusive practices in many places. We will remain relentless in trying to stop it, to put a spotlight on it. And theres no one-size-fits-all approach. Were looking at each case, each instance, each place on its own terms, trying to make judgements each time about how we can actually be most effective in bringing these abuses to an end.\n\nThank you. Thank you, everyone.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: I really hope everyone gets a break, has time with family, with friends, and that we see you fully energized in 2023. Look forward to seeing you then. Thanks.",

I didn't inform her last night. I know she would be traumatized,\" said a young male law student in Kabul, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"It really expresses (the Taliban's) illiteracy and poor knowledge of Islam and human rights. If the situation continues like this, the future will be worse. Everyone is scared.\"\n\nIn the eastern city of Jalalabad, some male students walked out of their exams in protest against the decision.\n\nUpon their return to power, the Taliban had promised to be more flexible, but they quickly re-enforced a harsh interpretation of Islam that had marked their first stint in power between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe restrictions on women have multiplied in recent months. They are banned from most government jobs or paid a pittance to stay at home, not authorized to travel alone outside their city, and are excluded from parks and gardens.\n\n\"We have no power to do anything and there is no one to listen to us,\" said one 29-year-old, who is doing a masters in Pashto literature in Kabul.\n\n\"We can't protest, we are hopeless. In every aspect of life we are doomed,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"We don't have jobs, we can't go anywhere, and we can't leave the country. We have lost everything.\"\n\nDeep in anguish, she still clung to the hope that the Taliban - whose restrictions on women have only become increasingly severe - would row back on the announcement after the winter break.\n\n\"We will wait for the next three months to see if they change their order. They might change their policies and restart the universities.\"\n\nIf they do not, she called on men to stop attending classes in protest.\n\n\"They too must stay at home until the girls are allowed to go back,\" she pleaded.",

                "cc_text": "Palestinians have been accused of being pro-Russia. But they are just tired of never-ending Western hypocrisy.\n\nDr Adnan Abu Amer is the head of the Political Science Department at the University of the Ummah in Gaza.\n\nWhen Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, many Palestinians felt this war concerns them directly. Over the past nine months, they have seen direct parallels between their own experience of occupation and military violence and the Ukrainians.\n\nWhether it is the targeting of civilian housing, schools, religious buildings, etc; the destruction of the electrical grid as a form of collective punishment; accusations of using civilians as \"live shields\" when the death toll climbs; or the occupation power denying the nationhood and statehood of the occupied, the similarities are apparent.\n\nBut not for the Ukrainian government. In fact, shortly after the start of the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made it clear that he identified the plight of Ukraine with that of Israel. \"The threat is the same: for both us and you the total destruction of the people, state, culture,\" he said.\n\nKyivs Western allies, media and international organisations have also taken the same position. They have backed Ukraine full-heartedly and have pretended that there is no equivalence with Palestines situation.\n\nThe Palestinians have publicly expressed their outrage at these double standards and their reactions have been interpreted as support for Russia. But Palestinians are not really taking a stance here. They are just tired of Western hypocrisy that knows no limits.\n\nRussia brutalises, Israel defends\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, there was hardly any hesitation in the West about what it needed to do. It immediately condemned Moscow as the aggressor and accepted Ukraine as the victim. The haste and the declared moral clarity with which this judgement was passed surprised Palestinians, who for decades have been listening to the same Western refrain about Israeli aggression: \"Israel has the right to defend itself\".\n\nThe West has unequivocally supported Ukrainian resistance and has not hesitated to call it that. Yet, it is difficult to ignore the fact that people resisting the Russian occupation of Eastern Ukraine have been called \"partisans\", while Palestinians doing the same in Palestine armed or unarmed have always been framed as \"terrorists\".\n\nWestern politicians seem to have been on alert around the clock, ready to condemn immediately any Russian bombardment that causes civilian casualties. Indeed, such condemnations are justified and must be made, but they have been conspicuously absent when Israel engages in its routine wars on Gaza and massacres Palestinian children, women and men.\n\nWestern leaders, like French President Emmanuel Macron, have declared that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine, not even waiting for UN or other official investigations to conclude. The EU has called for a special tribunal to prosecute war crimes in Ukraine and has supported an ICC investigation into the matter. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has condemned \"Russias brutality against Ukraine\" and said it should not be \"normalised\".\n\nBut the US government does not seem to mind violence committed against Palestinian civilians, whether through bombardment or extrajudicial killings by the Israeli army. These crimes have neither been named nor condemned. Worse yet, Blinken and his predecessors have openly objected to an ICC investigation of Israeli war crimes in Palestine and even threatened the court.\n\nThe US, along with other Western powers, have also routinely ignored Palestinian calls to implement the hundreds of resolutions the UN has passed in favour of their rights. What is more, Israels violation of international law, in general, has not been sanctioned by the West. On the contrary, it seems to be rewarded with ever-closer ties, military aid and extensive trade.\n\nFor decades, Western powers have also covered up for Israels illegal annexation of Palestinian land. Yet in September, they were quick to reject Moscows annexation of four regions in Eastern Ukraine. Most ridiculously, Israel joined them in condemning the move, despite its own illegal annexation practices.\n\nWashington then thought it necessary to publicly reject any comparisons between Israel and Russia, when a UN report claiming \"de facto\" annexation of the West Bank was released.\n\nOne side in Ukraine, both sides in Palestine\n\nThe Western double standards on Ukraine and Palestine have, of course, extended to Western media. Major outlets have readily adopted the language their politicians have chosen to use for the war in Ukraine, just as they have for Palestine.\n\nAll these years, Western TV channels and newspapers have hidden behind the ideas of \"balance\" and \"objectivity\", to avoid calling things as they are in Palestine: occupation, intentional targeting of civilians, collective punishment, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, etc.\n\nThey have talked about \"both sides\" even when Israel has massacred Palestinian civilians or gone into passive voice to hide the perpetrator as if Palestinians die violent deaths by themselves. The Western media coverage of Ukraine has not suffered from the same vocabulary challenges.\n\nPalestinians have also rarely appeared on Western TV screens (if at all) to explain what is happening on the ground; airtime has been almost exclusively reserved for Israeli spokespeople and pro-Israel analysts. And even on social media, which purports to offer platforms for free expression, Palestinian voices have been silenced by tech giants like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOn the other hand, Ukrainian politicians, analysts, and civilians have been a regular feature of Western broadcasts; absent, of course, are Russian government or pro-government voices. Russian state media has also been blocked on major social media platforms.\n\nWestern media has not dropped its double standards even when the safety and life of fellow journalists in Palestine have been at risk. One just has to look at how the assassination of Palestinian journalist Shereen Abu Akleh was reported on. Shereen was \"killed while covering a raid\", one report says and follows with a quote from an Israeli spokesperson, saying that she and her colleagues \"were armed with cameras\".\n\nThe killings of journalists in Ukraine have rightfully been condemned by Western media. However, there have been no quotes attached from Russian officials claiming they deserved their deaths.\n\nBoycott Russia, embrace Israel\n\nIn the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, Russia faced an unprecedented campaign of sanctions and boycotts led by the West. Russian companies and individuals were put on sanctions lists, various financial services for Russians were blocked, and even Russian oil and gas imports were curbed.\n\nMany multinationals pulled out of the Russian market and divested from its economy, while governments sought to minimise trade with Moscow.\n\nFor years, Palestinians have dreamed of this type of action in defence of their rights. They have been calling for sanctions to be imposed on Israel as a response to its occupation of Palestinian lands and its regime of apartheid, but to no avail. The most the EU, for example, has done is impose mandatory labelling for products coming from illegal Israeli settlements built on Palestinian land.\n\nThe boycott campaign against Russia has also been remarkably wide-ranging and quick. Russian citizens, whether or not they support the war in Ukraine, have been barred from international events and engagement in the fields of education, culture and sports. The Russian football team, which qualified for the World Cup play-offs and could have made it to Qatar 2022, was even barred from playing in FIFAs tournament.\n\nBy contrast, not only have Palestinian calls for a boycott of their Israeli aggressor fallen on deaf ears but also athletes who have decided to engage in individual acts of boycott of Israel have been threatened and sanctioned.\n\nIn the rare moments where solidarity with the Palestinians has had a sizable and visible presence at an international sporting event, it has been attacked. Most recently, the Moroccan team, which celebrated its victories in the World Cup by raising the Palestinian flag, faced accusations of anti-Semitism in German media. Of course, raising the Ukrainian flag has never been a cause of concern for German or other Western media outlets.\n\nBoycotting Russia has also been sanction-free. Palestinians and their supporters, on the other hand, have had to pay a heavy price for building and leading the international Boycott, Divestment, Sanction (BDS) movement, as they have faced not only smear campaigns and slander, but also outright government hostility in places like Germany, France the US, and the UK.\n\nIndeed, over the past nine months, Western hypocrisy has been on endless display. Palestinians did not need the Ukrainian war to know that they are treated differently, that their lives do not matter, and that international law does not apply to them. But this conflict was perhaps the final act that pulled down the faade the West used to cover its duplicity.\n\nThe Palestinians do not blame Ukrainians for this state of affairs, although their government should know better than to seek favour with Israel. Already that has proven fruitless, diplomatically and militarily.\n\nThe Palestinians, who have long suffered from Israeli wars and occupation, wish for the war in Ukraine to end, for Ukraine to be free. They stand in solidarity with the victims.\n\nYet, they cannot hide their resentment at the unfair treatment they have received. Palestinian lives must matter to the rest of the world as much as Ukrainian lives do. War crimes and occupation must be condemned in Ukraine, but also in Palestine.\n\nThe West must understand that biased, selective application of international law and anti-war action only further encourage aggressors to commit violations.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeeras editorial stance.",

                "cc_text": "Europes newest forum will need momentum to bring concrete results for member states, with several possible scenarios for its future, writes Sir Michael Leigh.\n\nSir Michael Leigh, former EU official in charge of EU enlargement, teaches at Johns Hopkins University (SAIS) in Bologna. A longer version of this article appeared in the GIS website.\n\nWith the European Political Community, a new intergovernmental grouping of 44 countries joined the continents crowded diplomatic scene in October in a show of solidarity after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nIts name, suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron, evokes the early days of the European Union. But will it be a step toward EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the Western Balkans? A framework for dialogue with the United Kingdom and other external states?\n\nPresident Macron has argued that the EU needs a new way to engage with other European states besides its faltering Neighborhood Policy and enlargement process. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has insisted that the EU must streamline its decision-making before expanding; otherwise, a body with up to 36 members would be dysfunctional.\n\nThe yearlong \"Conference on the Future of Europe,\" sponsored by France, failed to devise solutions. Macrons proposed constitutional convention to rewrite the EUs founding treaties did not materialise, with Europe gripped by war, supply shocks and inflation.\n\nInstead adapting an earlier French model, Macron presented the EPC as a new structure, embracing all European countries except Russia and Belarus. This would deliver a message of unity, he claimed, against a backdrop of Russian aggression and a precarious American commitment to European security.\n\nFor EU candidates, it would be a bridge to membership; for other European states, it would reinforce diplomatic, political, and economic ties. The UKs (initially hesitant) participation would be a significant first step toward post-Brexit cooperation. Macron expected the EPC to offer not only dialogue but also projects with tangible benefits in areas like security and energy.\n\nThe EPCs inaugural summit, organised by the Czech EU Council presidency, met in Prague on 6 October, with 44 countries attending. These included 27 EU members, 10 EU candidates and potential candidates (including Turkey), three European Economic Area states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Switzerland, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the UK. The EU Commission and Council presidents were also present, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the summit from Kyiv.\n\nRoundtables focused on peace and security, climate change and energy, migration and the economy. The Prague summits pragmatic approach was widely welcomed. Further meetings were scheduled for spring 2023 in Moldova and later in Spain and the UK. The absence of preconditions or pressure to agree on \"common principles\" was reassuring for some national leaders. But this flexibility raised questions about the EPCs actual value compared to the Council of Europe, which has a nearly identical membership. Can it achieve concrete results with such diverse participation and a bare-bones structure?\n\nLean institution\n\nBy design, the EPC has no secretariat, financial resources or staff. EPC summit and roundtable agendas will be set by a host country that alternates between EU and non-EU members. The European Commission seems the apparent body to provide continuity between summit meetings. This might seem natural, as the 27 EU members form most of the EPC, and the EUs top two officials participate in its meetings.\n\nBut the Prague session moved away from this model, with important roles emerging for the UK and other countries not interested in EU membership. The Czech Republic even suggested that Israel be invited, which was not taken up.\n\nClub of democracies?\n\nIn a May speech launching the EPC in Strasbourg, Macron called for bringing together \"democratic European nations that subscribe to our shared core values.\" Yet the European Neighborhood Policy has demonstrated the futility of a box-ticking exercise that expects countries to sign up to values they do not uphold in practice. This often leads to accusations of bad faith. Several EPC participants in the southern Caucasus, eastern Europe and the Balkans including Turkey and, indeed, EU members themselves do not live up to supposed European standards. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Serbia and Turkey maintain close links with Russia.\n\nRisks and uncertainties\n\nThe chief risk associated with the EPC is that it becomes a talking shop with no tangible results. Secondly, the EPC may be seen in eastern Europe as a diversion from EU membership, not as a stepping stone. This would remove incentives to participate in the new forum actively and could weaken trust.\n\nFinally, the EPC may be perceived in the Kremlin as a way of taunting Russian President Vladimir Putin especially given the involvement of countries viewed by Moscow as within its sphere of influence. Ahead of the Prague summit, French representatives denied that the EPC was an anti-Russian initiative.\n\nFaced with such uncertainties, the EPC may evolve along different paths:\n\nPhoto opportunity\n\nUnder this scenario, Europes urgent security and economic challenges lose the summits initial momentum. Participation at future gatherings is half-hearted and increasingly with appearances by ministers and senior officials instead of heads of government. Roundtable and plenary discussions become desultory. No working groups convene between summits, and sherpas meet rarely. Gradually, they become less frequent.\n\nThe European Commission is discouraged from putting forward joint projects, but no other entity emerges to take on these tasks. Eventually, some minor environmental and tourism projects are identified to be loosely coordinated by national ministries.\n\nAn insistence by several EU countries on respecting European values and aligning with the EUs foreign policy alienates several participants; Moscow offers them incentives to withdraw.\n\nFledgling forum\n\nUnder this scenario, the EPC becomes widely accepted as the only regular top-level, Europe-wide forum with all members on a common footing. In its first two years, the EPC holds four summits and develops a lean governance structure, including an independent secretariat, well-defined areas of cooperation, and a budget contributed proportionately by its members.\n\nIt meets twice yearly at the summit level under a rotating presidency, alternating between EU and non-EU hosts, and sets up working groups in agreed priority areas. These generate collective security, energy, climate, infrastructure and migration projects. Projects are coordinated by national ministries.\n\nShared assessments of threats to European security are made. The EPC helps mobilise and coordinate support for the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine. It provides a setting where the UK and other countries not aspiring to EU membership can engage with EU partners. Britain hosts the fourth summit meeting, branded as the UK-European Cooperation Forum.\n\nIf France and Germany, still indispensable agents of change in Europe, resume their usual cooperation and find a common interest in maintaining the EPC, this initiative would have a future as the only top-level, pan-European forum for regular dialogue.",

All times EST.\n\n11:30 pm.:\n\n11 p.m.: Russian gas exports to Europe via pipelines plummeted to a post-Soviet low in 2022 as its largest customer cut imports because of the conflict in Ukraine and a major pipeline was damaged by mysterious blasts, Gazprom data and Reuters calculations showed.\n\nThe European Union, traditionally Russia's largest consumer for oil and gas, has for years spoken about cutting its reliance on Russian energy, but Brussels got serious after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February.\n\nState-controlled Gazprom, citing Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, a long-standing ally of President Vladimir Putin, said its exports outside of ex-Soviet Union will reach 100.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) this year.\n\nThat is a fall of more than 45% from 185.1 bcm in 2021 and includes supplies to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, through which Gazprom supplied 10.39 bcm last year.\n\nRussian direct gas exports to Germany, Europe's largest economy, were halted in September following blasts at the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea.\n\nSweden and Denmark have both concluded that four leaks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 were caused by explosions but have not said who might be responsible.\n\n10:30 p.m.: Work has begun in the Black Sea port city of Odesa to remove a monument of the Russian 18th-century empress Catherine the Great, often referred to as \"the founder of Odesa,\" from the city center amid Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The move was decided by the Odesa city council on November 30, when local lawmakers also decided to remove a monument of Russian 18th-century general and military commander Aleksandr Suvorov.\n\nWatch a video about the statue by Stuart Greer in Odesa.\n\n9:50 p.m.: President Vladimir Putin has gifted eight golden rings to Moscow-allied leaders of post-Soviet countries, sparking a torrent of jokes and comparisons with power-hungry tyrant Sauron from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nDuring a summit that took place in Saint Petersburg on Monday and Tuesday, the leaders of eight post-Soviet states received golden rings that showcase the emblem of the regional organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and feature the engraved words \"Russia\" and \"Happy New Year 2023.\"\n\nPutin kept the ninth ring for himself.\n\nOf the foreign leaders, only Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko was pictured wearing the present.\n\nSome political commentators such as prominent political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann said the allusion to the epic fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien was intentional.\n\nIn Tolkien's classic, Sauron gives rings to nine kings in order to enslave them and bend them to his will.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was no need to read too much into the meaning of the gifts.\n\n\"It's just a New Year's souvenir, there's nothing special about it,\" he said. Putin will not be wearing his ring, he added.\n\n9 p.m.:\n\n8 p.m.: A U.S. weapon first used in 1999 in Kosovo will soon be used by Ukrainian pilots flying Russian-made jets to kill Russian soldiers, the New York Times reports.\n\nCalled the Joint Direct Attack Munition, it is a kit that turns a cheap, unguided bomb into a highly accurate, GPS-guided weapon a precision-guided bomb that Ukraine has never had before. And it is part of the $1.85 billion in military aid package.\n\nWhen dropped from higher altitudes, the bomb can travel about 15 miles to its target before exploding.\n\n7:22 p.m.: A Swiss court has granted a six-month \"stay of bankruptcy\" to the operating company for the never-opened Nord Stream 2 pipeline, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe pipeline was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but put on ice shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nA regional court in the Swiss canton (state) of Zug extended the stay from Jan. 10 through July 10 by, according to a notice published Wednesday in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\nThe company, Nord Stream 2 AG, is a subsidiary of Russias Gazprom but based in Zug. Its court-appointed administrator had sought the extension. German Chancellor Olaf Scholzs government halted the certification process for the pipeline on February 22.\n\n6:44 p.m.:\n\n6 p.m.: Ship insurers said they are cancelling war risk coverage across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, following an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses, Reuters reported.\n\nReinsurers typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on January 1, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started, after being hit this year by losses related to the conflict and from Hurricane Ian in Florida.\n\nP&I (protection and indemnity) clubs American, North, UK and West are no longer able to offer war risk cover for some liabilities in the region beginning Jan. 1, they said. The clubs are among the biggest P&I insurers who cover around 90% of the worlds ocean-going ships.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology says his country is developing combat drones that attack the ones Russia has used during its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov described Russias war in Ukraine as the first major war of the internet age. He credited drones and satellite internet systems like Elon Musks Starlink with having transformed the conflict.\n\nFedorov says the Ukrainian military so far has used drones mostly for reconnaissance and that strike zones are the next step. The minister also discussed the challenges Ukraine faces in maintaining internet service during the war.\n\n4:12 p.m.: A group of ethnic Chechens fleeing Russia has arrived in Bosnia with hopes of using the Balkan country as a launchpad to reach the European Union and avoid getting sent to fight in Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Bosnian Security Ministry said Wednesday that about 50 people, predominantly from Russias Chechnya region, congregated near Bosnias northwestern border with EU-member Croatia. The ministry said the travelers want to reach the EU because they are \"fleeing [to avoid] military draft\" in Russia.\n\nRussians can enter Bosnia without a visa and are permitted to stay in the country for a maximum of 90 days. The ethnic Chechens gathered near the Bosnia-Croatia border include families with children.\n\n3:46 p.m.: Frances defense minister, Sbastien Lecornu, visited Kyiv Wednesday, pledging further military support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. Lecornu met with Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraines defense minister. They discussed Frances \"reliable and lasting support\" to Ukraine and the needs of its military in the next year. Lecornu said the support will include French army equipment and a 200 million euro ($212 million) fund that would allow Ukraine to purchase weapons.\n\nThis is the first time Lecornu has visited Ukraine since Russia invaded the country 10 months ago. Lecornu said his governments backing is unflagging, while efforts are also made with Moscow to reach an eventual negotiated end to Russia's invasion.\n\nLecornu was also due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n2:27 p.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has delivered his final speech of the year to Ukraine's parliament, reported Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, telling lawmakers that Ukraine is recognized worldwide for its unity and courage in the face of the Russian invasion. Ukraine's national colors \"are the international symbol of courage,\" Zelenskyy said in the speech Wednesday, which was delayed by more than an hour because of an airstrike. \"In any country, in any continent, when you see blue and yellow, you know it's about freedom. About the people who did not surrender, who stood, who united the world, and which will win,\" he said. Zelenskyy said the world had seen that freedom can be triumphant through Ukraine's gains on the battlefield, adding his thanks to all of Ukraine's military. 1:53 p.m.: Germany on Wednesday shrugged off Russia's ban on oil sales to countries and companies that comply with a price cap agreed by Western allies, saying it has \"no practical significance,\" Agence France-Presse reported. \"I would not like to say that it's irrelevant but it has no practical significance,\" said an economy ministry spokeswoman, adding that Germany has been preparing since early summer to do without Russian oil. Berlin has been working to ensure security of supply which \"continues to be assured regardless of whether this decree has been issued or not.\" Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy, but has been forced to wean itself off crude, coal and gas from the power giant after Moscow invaded Ukraine. 1:05 p.m.: Russian forces rained artillery fire on Ukrainian positions along the whole contact line in the east, with a focus on Bakhmut and Avdiyivka in Donetsk, where the heaviest fighting has been taking place over the past months, the General Staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 12:33 p.m.: The number of confirmed civilian casualties from Russia's war in Ukraine is nearing 18,000, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said, according to a report from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. From February 24, when Moscow launched its unprovoked invasion, to December 26, there were 17,831 civilian casualties recorded in the country -- 6,884 killed and 10,947 wounded, the OHCHR said in a statement. The agency added that the actual toll was \"considerably higher\" but that getting reliable data from frontline areas was difficult. Among the killed were 429 children, the OHCHR said. 11:47 a.m.: How 'Angel' the Chechen Overcame Ukrainian Suspicions and Joined the Fight Against Russia: \"Angel\" is a Chechen volunteer currently fighting in one of Ukraine's military units. After the Second Chechen War started in 1999, he fled to Ukraine with his family, where he's lived ever since. At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, \"Angel\" and his son joined the Ukrainian military and have been fighting on the front lines in the Donbas region. He shared his story with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Yevhenia Nazarova in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya region.\n\n10:50 a.m.: In the Kharkhiv region, it is only now months of intense Russian bombardment down the line that Ukrainian electrical engineers can begin reconnecting the power grid. Agence France-Presse visited a village near the front line where barely a single home was left undamaged during the fighting.\n\nBarely 10 kilometers from the Russian border, these electrical engineers are trying to repair a substation that was damaged in a bombardment.\n\nThis entire zone was on the front line, until the Ukrainian army recaptured it in September. For more than five months, villages here suffered heavy bombardment.\n\n10:07 a.m.: The ruble weakened sharply on Wednesday, sliding to the 72 mark against the dollar, as sanctions on Russian oil and their probable impact on export revenues put pressure on the Russian currency, Reuters reported.\n\nThe ruble lost about 8% against the dollar last week and is on course for a hefty monthly decline after an oil embargo and price cap came into force. The finance ministry has said the recent slump is related to recovering imports.\n\nThe ruble has experienced high volatility in the past two weeks and is liable to sharp swings amid smaller trading volumes in the run up to Russia's New Year holidays.\n\n\"The newly imposed Western sanctions have contributed to the recent falls in energy prices, which is certainly putting pressure on the ruble,\" said Olga Yangol, head of emerging markets research and strategy for Americas at Credit Agricole CIB.\n\n9:32 a.m.: Frances defense minister has arrived in Kyiv to discuss further military support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported. French Minister for the Armed Forces Sebastien Lecornu laid a wreath at a heroes monument in Ukraine's capital on Wednesday. He was scheduled to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and army officials. While France has been less vocal about its military support for Ukraine than the United States and Britain, the country has sent a steady supply of weapons since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. Lecornu tweeted that the French governments backing is \"constant\" while efforts are made to reach an eventual negotiated end to the war.\n\n8:40 a.m.: For the paratroopers of a Ukrainian airborne brigade, theres only one way to describe the waves of Russian infantry who are relentlessly pressing the Ukrainian lines in and around this Donbas city: Meat.\n\n\"First, they throw in the mobilized soldiers for certain death, like meat,\" one soldier, who asked not to be identified due to military regulations, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. \"Then, if they break through, the more experienced fighters move in.\"\n\nWith Russians invasion of Ukraine now in its 11th month, the ferocity of the fighting in Kreminna is matched only by the intensity of the fighting 80 kilometers to the south, in the city of Bakhmut.\n\nBut according to interviews with Ukrainian soldiers and accounts published on Russian military blogger accounts on Telegram and elsewhere, the bloodshed is no less senseless and relentless. Its unclear how long it will last, though: One Ukrainian official claims that Kreminna is on the verge of being recaptured by Ukrainian forces.\n\n8:16 a.m.:\n\n7:30 a.m.: Russia's economy contracted by more than 2% over the past 11 months, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said during a televised government meeting on Wednesday.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Air raid sirens sounded across all Ukraine's regions on Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes.\n\nThe capital Kyiv and other regions sounded the all-clear almost two hours later.\n\nUkrainian social media reports said the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off.\n\nReuters was unable to immediately verify that information.\n\n6:50 a.m.: A tip-off from a friendly Western intelligence agency helped Germany identify an employee in its foreign intelligence service (BND) who was arrested on suspicion of passing state secrets to Russia, Reuters reported Wednesday citing the Spiegel magazine.\n\nPolice in December arrested a German citizen identified as Carsten L. in a treason investigation, and searched his home and workplace and those of another person. The Russian embassy has declined comment.\n\nThe German authorities have warned of likely heightened Russian spying given the Kremlin's standoff with the West over its invasion of Ukraine. The German government expelled what it said were 40 Russian spies in April.\n\nCiting people familiar with the investigation, Spiegel reported that a Western intelligence agency had found material in Moscow's possession that came from the BND and contained intelligence on Russia.\n\nThe suspected double agent was the head of a unit in the BND's technical reconnaissance department, Spiegel said.\n\nThe BND and the attorney general's office declined comment.\n\nA government spokesperson also declined comment at a press briefing, saying the government took the matter seriously but it would not divulge details about the investigation in a way that could benefit Russia.\n\n6 a.m.: The head of Russia's state-controlled airline Aeroflot called on the Russian government to \"balance the interests\" of Russian and foreign airlines in order to support the domestic aviation sector, Reuters reported in an interview with Russian news site RBC published on Wednesday.\n\nIn the interview, Aeroflot CEO Sergei Alexandrovsky said it is \"important that the state balances the interests of Russian and international carriers. Because it is obvious that foreign carriers now have much more opportunities and advantages in these conditions.\"\n\nRussian airlines stopped flying to most overseas destinations after Western countries imposed unprecedented sanctions, including bans on Russian carriers, after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24. Routes to Turkey and Middle Eastern countries popular with Russian tourists have been preserved.\n\nAlexandrovsky said that competitors, including Turkish Airlines and Emirates had benefitted most from the situation, and called for a degree of what he called \"state protectionism\" to safeguard domestic aviation.\n\n5:47 a.m.: Russia did not consult with OPEC+ on its response to a Western price cap on Russian oil, Reuters reported that Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, stating that it was Russia's sovereign right to respond as it sees fit to such \"illegal measures\".\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin on Tuesday delivered Russia's long-awaited response to the cap, signing a decree that bans the supply of crude oil and oil products from Feb. 1 for five months to nations that abide by it.\n\nPeskov said contacts between Russia and the OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers, which includes Russia, were ongoing on other issues.\n\n5:30 a.m.: According to Reuters, the Kremlin on Wednesday said that peace proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it called \"the new reality\" of four Ukrainian regions having joined Russia.\n\nRussia declared Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia part of its territory in September after referendums condemned by Ukraine and Western countries. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.\n\n5:10 a.m.: In an interview with The Associated Press, Ukraines Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, called Russias invasion of Ukraine the first major war of the digital age. Now, technology like drones and satellite internet systems are mentioned in the same breath as traditional tanks, missiles and other weapons.\n\nUkraine has bought more than 1,400 drones and, in the interview, Fedorov discussed where he sees the technology going and how Ukraine plans to outpace Russia in the months ahead.\n\n4:40 a.m.:\n\n4:15 a.m.: One of President Vladimir Putin's most powerful Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine Russia says it has annexed, Reuters cited a Moscow-installed official in the region as saying.\n\nSergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia's domestic politics and a former head of the country's state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed local official.\n\n\"Sergei Kiriyenko visited the nuclear power plant he checked the safety of the facility and the working conditions of Rosatom employees,\" Rogov said on Telegram.\n\nIn a picture published by Rogov, Kiriyenko was shown outside the plant, which lies just 500 km (300 miles) from the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chornobyl disaster.\n\nShortly after invading Ukraine on February 24, Russian forces took control of the plant in early March. The facility remains near the frontlines, and has repeatedly come under fire in recent months, with Kyiv and Moscow trading blame for the shelling.\n\nSpecial Russian military units guard the facility and Russian nuclear specialists are on site. Ukrainian staff continue to help operate the plant.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235, which has a half-life of more than 700 million years.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.\n\n3:50 a.m.:\n\n3:30 a.m.: Reuters reported that Italy's defense minister struck a cautious tone on whether Italy would be able to supply Ukraine with air defense systems, as requested by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe systems would be provided \"if possible,\" Guido Crosetto told Il Messaggero newspaper in an article published on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, \"if we give air defense missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality,\" he added.\n\nCrosetto told Reuters this month that the Franco-Italian SAMP/T air defense system was among the military aid that Kyiv had requested from Rome.\n\nHis remarks to Il Messaggero follow a Tuesday call between Zelenskyy and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, after which Zelenskyy tweeted that Rome was considering supplying air defenses.\n\nHe is pressing Ukraine's Western allies to step up military aid to help counter three months of Russian missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure.\n\nUnder former Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Italy sent five aid packages to Kyiv including military supplies, and Meloni's government is working on a possible sixth delivery.\n\nMeloni, who took office in October, has been a firm supporter of Kyiv, despite friction on the issue within her rightist ruling coalition and a strong pacifist element among domestic public opinion.\n\n2:50 a.m.: Reuters reported that Russia's Gazprom said that it will ship 42.3 million cubic meters of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, a volume broadly in line with recent days.\n\n2:20 a.m.:\n\n2 a.m.:\n\n1:30 a.m.: Russian forces fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday,Reuters reported citing Ukraine's military, as fighting intensified with Russia deploying more tanks and armored vehicles on front lines.\n\nThe General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in its morning report that Russia forces were attacking populated areas on the right bank of the Dnipro River near Kherson with mortars and artillery.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the reports.\n\n1:03 a.m.: Russian troops who have been part of a mobilization drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing the state TASS agency.\n\nQuoting Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan.\n\nThe ministry \"determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilized to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024,\" Trunov was quoted as saying.\n\nFamilies can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so.\n\nRussia called up more than 300,000 reservists to support what it calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine in a mobilization drive launched in September.\n\nThe drive prompted hundreds of thousands of Russian men to flee from the country to avoid being conscripted and sparked the largest anti-Kremlin protests since Russia sent in its troops into Ukraine in February.\n\nThe war, which Ukraine and its Western allies call an unprovoked aggression to grab land is in its 11th month, having entered a slow, grinding phase as bitter winter weather has set in.\n\n12:35 a.m.: Reuters has published an explainer on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys 10-point peace plan, which he first introduced at the G-20 Summit Meeting in November. The plan calls for:\n\n1. Radiation and nuclear safety, focusing on restoring safety around Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, which is now-Russian occupied.\n\n2. Food security, including protecting and ensuring Ukraine's grain exports to the world's poorest nations.\n\n3. Energy security, with focus on price restrictions on Russian energy resources, as well as aiding Ukraine with restoring its power infrastructure, half of which has been damaged by Russian attacks.\n\n4. Release of all prisoners and deportees, including war prisoners and children deported to Russia.\n\n5. Restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity and Russia reaffirming it according to the U.N. Charter, which Zelenskyy said is \"not up to negotiations.\"\n\n6. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities, restoration of Ukraine's state borders with Russia.\n\n7. Justice, including the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes.\n\n8. Prevention of ecocide, protection of environment, with focus on demining and restoring water treatment facilities.\n\n9. Prevention of escalation of conflict and building security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, including guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n10. Confirmation of the war's end, including a document signed by the parties involved.\n\n12:03 a.m.: Ukraine's population may shrink to 35 million by 2030, demographers in Ukraine's Mykhailo Ptukha Institute have predicted, down from the pre-war number of 41 million, Euromaidan Press reported.\n\nThe institute director Ella Libanova said during a presentation that this is the optimistic estimate: Russia's full-blown war is leading to excessive mortality not only by killing people with weapons but through elevated stress, overburdening, insufficient medical care, lack of proper nutrition.\n\nThe pessimistic estimate is 30 million.\n\nUkraine's low birth rate contributes to the problem. In 2021, it was at the extremely low rate of 1.1 children per woman, far below the replacement rate of 2.13-2.15. Libanova expects it to fall in 2023, with 0.8 being the optimistic estimate.\n\nMigration is yet another factor that can contribute to Ukraine's depopulation. Whether refugees who have escaped abroad will return or not depends on the duration of hostilities and post-war conditions in Ukraine.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

The question arises, for what? Russia has always met us halfway. There is not a single issue that has remained unresolved today. We are meeting the Russian Federation halfway in the most difficult moment,\" Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state news agency BelTA.\n\n\"If someone is hatching up plans to tear us apart, to drive a wedge between us, they will not succeed. In 2020, it was not Russia that attacked us around the perimeter. It was not Russia. Russia extended a helping hand to us. We were attacked from there [from the West]. They wanted to deprive us of both independence and sovereignty,\" he claimed.\n\nBelarus saw mass protests in 2020 after an election that many observers believe was rigged to keep long-term leader Lukashenko in power. The protests were met with a harsh response from Belarus' security services. Lukashenko baselessly blamed the West for inciting the demonstrations. Russia said it was ready to support Lukashenko's leadership should the protests get \"out of control.\"\n\nFollowing months of increased joint military exercises and meetings, concerns have grown that Belarus could enter the Ukraine war to assist Russia (it has already allowed Moscow to launch attacks from its territory). On Monday, Lukashenko said nothing would be able to \"break our relationship\" with Russia but did not mention the possibility of Belarus assisting Russia in the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"So what is there to say? Just one more time: they will not be able to break our relationship. It will only strengthen. Today, in fact, together with the president and our colleagues, we have created a base for the future rapid progress,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nHolly Ellyatt",

                "cc_text": "The war is poised to escalate as Russia has planned new conscription and Ukraines allies have lifted weapons bans.\n\nRussia has announced plans to form 17 new divisions and a new army corps, restoring much of the militarys former Soviet glory, as it continues to wage a relentless battle for Ukraines eastern territories in the 43rd week of its war.\n\nRussian defence minister Sergei Shoigu unveiled plans on December 21 to expand the army from 1.15 million to 1.5 million, citing the imminent expansion of NATO to include Finland and Sweden. Within that force, the professional army would almost double to 695,000 a potential admission that Russias conscript force has proven ineffective in the offensive.\n\n\"The expansion of NATOs forward presence close to the frontiers of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, along with the Wests intention to continue military operations in Ukraine in an effort to weaken Russia as much as possible, are of special concern,\" Shoigu said.\n\nRussia conscripted 300,000 troops in September and October to send to Ukraine, and another 200,000 in its regular conscription cycle last month. Shoigus announcement suggests another 350,000 would now be recruited.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think-tank, agreed with the Ukrainian military leadership that Russia could be preparing for a big winter ground offensive possibly against Kyiv as a way of forcing Ukraine to negotiate on terms more favourable to Moscow.\n\nThe main Russian offensive in the east of Ukraine and its missile campaign of terror against the population \"are failing to coerce Ukraine into negotiating or offering preemptive concessions\", the ISW said.\n\nThe ISW assessed that Russia does not have the economic capacity to scale up its armed forces but that could change.\n\n\"Putin can decide to appropriate Russian state funds in such a manner that allows the Kremlin to field a large conventional military at the expense of economic growth and consumer comforts as the Soviets did,\" it said.\n\nAerial campaign\n\nRussia has continued its psychological war against Ukraines civilians. Air raid sirens went off throughout the country on December 16 as Russia launched 76 missiles at critical energy infrastructure its ninth extensive volley since launching the air campaign in early October.\n\nForty of the missiles were lobbed at Kyiv. Most were shot down but 16 hit their mark, causing power and water failures in several large cities, including the capital.\n\nTwo days later Ukraines general staff said air defences had destroyed 30 out of 35 Iranian-made Shahed drones fired into Ukrainian territory from the Sea of Azov.\n\nGround war\n\nThroughout the week, Russia and Ukraine launched ground offensives in the two eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nThe action was concentrated mainly in two areas between Svatove and Kreminna in Luhansk, which lies under Russian occupation just a few kilometres behind the line of contact, and between Soledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk, which Russia imminently threatens to overrun.\n\nOn December 16, Russia said its forces repelled reconnaissance and sabotage units probing the defences of Kreminna. Three days later, Russia claimed to have destroyed four reconnaissance groups near Rozivka, likely probing Russian defences around Svatove, just 15km (9.3miles) from the front lines.\n\nUkraines General Staff said its forces were repelling Russian ground offensives on a daily basis, inflicting high casualties. \"Due to the significant losses of the invaders, the repurposing of hospitals in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk oblast into military hospitals continues The local population is refused service and suggested to turn to other medical institutions.\"\n\nRussia claimed to have taken up \"new advantageous lines and positions\" in Donetsk every day. The only verifiable territorial gain was the Russian occupation of the settlement of Yakovlivka in Donetsk on December 18.\n\nThe most intense fighting has been in and around the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk, whose eastern outskirts are now Russian-occupied.\n\nIndependent Russian newspaper Meduza published photos of daily life there, showing people living in half-bombed buildings and crossing streams on duckboards. Much of daily life reportedly takes place underground.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a daring visit to the town on December 20, putting himself just streets away from Russian forces, and thanked soldiers \"for their courage, resilience and strength\". Zelenskyy has frequently arrived unannounced at various places along the front but this was his most fearless appearance to date.\n\nThe same day, Duma deputy Andrey Gurulev said Russian President Vladimir Putin was in the zone of the so-called special military operation, without revealing where, and \"spoke with all the commanders\" an apparent attempt to shore up Putins image as an involved military leader equal to Zelenskyy.\n\nPutin had first attempted this on December 16, when the Kremlin said he was at the joint headquarters of the armed forces. Video analysis suggested he was on Russian soil, at the Southern District headquarters in Rostov.\n\nA day after Bakhmut, Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC, appearing alongside US President Joe Biden, in what was his first known trip outside Ukraine since Russias invasion on February 24. He thanked Americans for providing military assistance and asked for more.\n\n\"We have artillery, yes, thank you. Is it enough? Honestly, not really,\" Zelenskyy told the US Congress, many of whose Republican members have expressed opposition to more spending on Ukraine. \"Your money is not charity. Its an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,\" he said.\n\nBiden had a ready response for Zelenskyy. He released the sophisticated US Patriot air defence system for use in Ukraine something Russias embassy in Washington, DC warned would have \"unpredictable consequences\". Congress is set to approve $45bn in new military and financial aid for Ukraine at the end of the year, in addition to the $70bn approved so far.\n\nThe relentlessness of the Russian campaign has led other NATO members to reconsider self-imposed limits on weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe United Kingdoms defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said he would reconsider the UKs refusal to supply long-range weapons if Russia continued attacks against civilians.\n\n\"I constantly review the weapons systems we could provide,\" Sky News quoted Wallace as telling parliament on December 13. \"We too have in our armour potential weapons systems that are longer and should the Russians continue to target civilian areas and try and break those Geneva Conventions, then I will be open-minded to see what we do next,\" he said, referring to the agreed basic humanitarian principles during war.\n\nSlovakia said on December 12 that it was prepared to send MiG-29 fighter planes to Ukraine, pending a NATO agreement. Poland has also been known to be pushing for NATO to allow it to send its MiGs.\n\nGreece was reportedly considering sending Ukraine a battery of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles currently in eastern Crete, something Russias foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said would be a \"blatantly aggressive move against Russia\".\n\nAsked whether the US would provide Greece with a Patriot air defence system to replace the S-300s, the state departments spokesman Ned Price referred to Slovakias donation of S-300s to Ukraine at the start of the war. \"We were able to help support and facilitate that contribution by backfilling Slovakias needs,\" he said.\n\nRussia, too, said it was fielding new weaponry, sending its most advanced T-90 \"Breakthrough\" tanks to the eastern front, without specifying how many. Moscow says the tank is its best protected and has \"highly automated fire control\" systems.\n\nPutin made a trip to Minsk. He said the militaries of Russia and Belarus were carrying out \"combat coordination\", stirring fears of a renewed attempt to march on Kiyv from the north. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine from Belarusian as well as Russian territory on February 24.\n\nPutin, who has constantly alluded to the potential use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine, also said he would continue \"training the crews of combat aircraft of the Belarusian army, which have already been converted for the possible use of air-launched ammunition with a special warhead\".\n\nAlthough Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko ruled out the use of nuclear weapons from his soil in February, in August he agreed to Putins proposal to modify Belarusian Su-24 planes to carry nuclear warheads.\n\nThe economic war also continued apace.\n\nEuropean Union energy ministers on December 19 agreed on a gas price ceiling of $180 megawatt hours in the internal EU market to curb energy costs to EU governments and consumers increased by the war. The cap is to become effective beginning February 15 at the Title Transfer Facility (TTF), the main European gas hub, and March 31 in all European gas hubs.\n\nBloomberg news agency reported that Russian oil exports had fallen by 54 percent in the week after a Group of Seven (G7) price cap of $60 a barrel came into force while cautioning that the sample was still too small to be sure that the cap was the cause of this drop.",

It shed 3.9% against the yuan to 9.64 , hitting its weakest level since early July.\n\nThe rouble has dropped almost 10% in December. That weakening stems from concerns that an oil embargo and price cap will reduce Russia's oil export revenues, increasing the budget deficit as imports gradually recover, said Alfa Capital analyst Yulia Melnikova.\n\n\"The sanctions rhetoric is also negative for the national currency,\" Melnikova added.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed to a ninth package of sanctions against Moscow last week, blacklisting nearly 200 more people and barring investment in Russia's mining industry, among others.\n\nThe rouble remains the world's best-performing currency this year, supported by capital controls and an initial collapse in imports as a result of Western sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine, and scores of foreign companies pausing operations in the country.\n\nTAX SUPPORT\n\nAnalysts expect that upcoming month-end tax payments, when exporters convert foreign currency revenue into roubles to pay local liabilities, will provide support for the rouble, but having crossed the 65 threshold for the first time since May, the currency could settle into a new, weaker range.\n\n\"Our view on oil, upcoming taxes and dividends allow us to maintain a forecast for a small rise in the near term,\" said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko Invest.\n\nBrent crude oil , a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 1.8% at $80.5 a barrel, but this month has traded at its lowest all year.\n\n\"If the rouble holds above 65 (which could happen if exporters remain inactive in spite of the looming tax and dividend payments), we could see it move into the 67-70 range before long,\" said SberCIB Investment Research in a note.\n\nThe rouble barely reacted when Russia's central bank on Friday held its key interest rate at 7.5%, but slightly shifted its tone to acknowledge growing inflation risks, saying a recent military mobilisation was adding to labour shortages.\n\nRussian stocks were also losing.\n\nThe dollar-denominated RTS index (.IRTS) was down 4% to 996.9 points, a more than two-month low. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (.IMOEX) was flat at 2,132.2 points.\n\nReporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Bradley Perrett, Ed Osmond, Arun Koyyur and Tomasz Janowski\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Ukraine is certainly taking the issue seriously, with Kyiv strengthening its defenses along the Belarusian border on the eve of Putins Minsk trip.\n\nUkrainian officials are increasingly voicing concerns that Moscow may be preparing to repeat the February 2022 offensive against Kyiv, which saw Russian troops use Belarus as a launchpad for an assault on the Ukrainian capital. In a recent interview with Britains The Economist magazine, Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraines armed forces, said he had no doubt Russia \"will have another go at Kyiv\" in the first few months of 2023.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nFollowing their three-hour meeting, Putin and Lukashenka did not make any major announcements. Instead, they spoke of ongoing negotiations over a series of bilateral trade, economic, and defense issues. Putin noted that both countries would proceed toward deeper security integration and said they would continue intensifying joint military exercises. Meanwhile, Lukashenka confirmed that Belarus has received Russian missile and air defense systems.\n\nBoth strongmen played down earlier suggestions that Russia was poised to annex Belarus or was planning to force the country to join the invasion of Ukraine, with Putin instead speaking of the strategic partnership between the two authoritarian regimes. These denials were echoed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who appeared to rule out the possibility of full-scale Belarusian involvement in Russias ongoing invasion.\n\nThere remains no real clarity over what was discussed behind closed doors in Minsk. Many observers believe talks regarding a possible join offensive against Ukraine must have been the focus of negotiations and note that Putins presence would hardly have been required for the official agenda of relatively routine discussions on non-essential matters. However, others have suggested that the Minsk meeting may have been nothing more than an opportunity for both parties to demonstrate their loyalty to each other at a time when each ruler is confronted by deepening international isolation.\n\nIf military matters were indeed discussed, this does not necessarily indicate plans for Belarus to directly participate in a new Kyiv offensive. Other options could include an expansion of the current Belarusian role as a base of operations for the Russian military or the provision of armor and ammunition from the Belarusian arsenal. Alternatively, the entire episode may be part of an elaborate ruse to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent their redeployment to current invasion hot spots in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n\nLukashenka is already widely seen as a party to the conflict after allowing Putin to use Belarus as a gateway for the initial invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For the past ten months, he has permitted Russia to base troops in Belarus and launch airstrikes from the country against Ukrainian targets. Following the announcement in September of Russias first mobilization since World War II, Belarus also began to serve as a training base for mobilized troops.\n\nDespite this obvious involvement, the Belarusian leader bristles at claims that he is a junior partner in Putins invasion. Ever since the outbreak of hostilities, he has denied that Belarus is actively participating in the conflict and has instead sought to position himself as a potential mediator. At the same time, in an apparent nod to his Kremlin patrons, Lukashenka has made a number of public declarations acknowledging the need to support neighboring Russia.\n\nThis awkard balancing act is understandable. There is little public enthusiasm in Belarus for the invasion of Ukraine, leading to doubts over the reliability of the Belarusian army if Lukashenka does give the order to cross the Ukrainian border. However, the Belarus dictator is almost entirely dependent on Moscow for his political survival and risks becoming expendible if he refuses direct Russian demands to join the war.\n\nFor the time being, Putin and Lukashenkas intentions remain shrouded in mystery. Few are prepared to take their denials at face value, but it is still too early to identify any specific preparations for a major new offensive. Ukrainian military planners certainly cannot afford to dismiss this threat. They will be spending the Christmas holiday period watching the situation closely while preparing for a potential escalation on the northern front.\n\nFor Putin, forcing Belarus to join the war would be a desperate gamble that could easily backfire. He has already suffered catastrophic losses in Ukraine and can ill afford another humiliating military defeat. However, with his invasion plans rapidly unraveling and his options narrowing, Putin may decide that it is worth the risk.\n\nAlesia Rudnik is a PhD Fellow at Karlstad University in Sweden and a Research Fellow at Belarusian think tank The Center for New Ideas.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

It has already threatened to cut supplies in 2023, which would push up the price of non-Russian oil and potentially bring pain to consumers.\n\nCheap Russian gas and oil\n\nThe war in Ukraine has brought significant volatility to global energy markets, sending prices soaring and European countries scrambling to wean themselves off cheap Russian oil and gas.\n\nThe decree, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to \"actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them.\n\n\"Deliveries of Russian oil and oil products to foreign entities and individuals are banned, on the condition that in the said, referring specifically to the US and other countries that have imposed the price cap.\n\n\"The established ban applies to all stages of supply up to the end buyer.\"\n\nOverrule the ban in special cases\n\nThe decree, which includes a clause that allows Putin to overrule the ban in special cases, said: \"This...comes into force on Feb 1, 2023, and applies until July 1, 2023.\"\n\nCrude oil exports will be banned from Feb 1 but the date for the oil products ban will be determined by the Russian government and could come later.\n\nThe price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Russian state coffers and Moscow's military efforts in Ukraine.\n\nSome analysts have said that the cap will have little immediate impact on the oil revenues that Moscow is earning.\n\nRussia has been promising to respond to the cap for weeks, and the eventual decree largely established what officials had already said publicly.\n\nThe G7 price cap allows non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil, but it will prohibit shipping, insurance and re-insurance companies from handling cargoes of Russian crude around the globe, unless it is being sold for less than the price cap.\n\nEU countries have separately implemented an embargo that prohibits them from purchasing seaborne Russian oil.",

It's not a takeover, it's a matter of policy alignment.\"\n\nAsked about this comment, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said it should be treated as the \"height of irony\", given it was \"coming from a leader who is seeking at the present moment, right now, to violently absorb his other peaceful next door neighbor.\"\n\nHe added that Washington would continue to watch very closely whether or not Belarus would provide additional support to Putin and would respond \"appropriately\" if it does.\n\n'OLDER BROTHER'\n\n[1/3]Russian President Vladimir Putin walks after disembarking from a plane upon his arrival at the National Airport Minsk in Minsk, Belarus December 19, 2022. Sputnik/Sergei Karpukhin/Pool via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLukashenko, at one point calling Putin an \"older brother\", praised Russia as a friend that had \"held out its hand to us\", providing Belarus with oil and gas at discounted prices.\n\n\"Russia can manage without us, but we can't (manage) without Russia,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Putin and Lukashenko have met numerous times this year, it was Putin's first trip to Minsk since before the COVID pandemic and a wave of pro-democracy protests in 2020 that Lukashenko crushed with strong support from the Kremlin.\n\nThe perception that Lukashenko, a pariah in the West, depends on Putin for his survival had fanned fears in Kyiv that Putin would pressure him to join a fresh ground offensive and open a new front in Russia's faltering invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's top general, Valery Zaluzhniy, told the Economist last week that Russia was preparing 200,000 fresh troops for a major offensive that could come from the east, south or even from Belarus as early as January, but more likely in spring.\n\nMoscow and Minsk have set up a joint military unit in Belarus and held numerous exercises. Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week.\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking to Russian news agencies before the meeting, called suggestions that Moscow wanted to draw Minsk into the conflict \"stupid and unfounded fabrications\".\n\nThe one-on-one meeting between Putin and Lukashenko followed a broader meeting that also included the countries' foreign and defense ministers, among others.\n\nBelarus' veteran leader said there had been agreement on a new price for supplies of Russian gas, but declined to provide details before his government had discussed it.\n\nHe thanked Putin for fulfilling a promise to upgrade Belarus' Russian-built military jets and supply Belarus with nuclear-capable Iskander-M tactical missile systems to defend itself against what he called the threat from the West.\n\n\"You've made a decisive and important step towards Belarus' security,\" he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Washington, Writing by Tom Balmforth and Kevin Liffey; Editing by Tomasz Janowski, Mark Heinrich and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

We have also actively managed down our costs while investing to build future demand.\"\n\nWeinstein continued, \"Booking volumes strengthened following the relaxation in protocols, cancellation trends are improving globally, and we have seen a measurable lengthening in the booking curve, across all brands. The momentum has continued into December, which bodes well for 2023 overall as more markets open for cruise travel, protocols continue to relax, our closer to home itineraries play out, our stepped-up advertising efforts pay dividends and our brands continue to hone all aspects of their revenue generating activities.\"\n\nWeinstein added, \"We believe we are accelerating our return to strong profitability through our fleet and brand portfolio management which is delivering prudent capacity growth weighted toward our highest returning brands and amplified by nearly a quarter of our fleet consisting of newly delivered vessels. We believe this leaves us well positioned to drive revenue growth across our global brand portfolio as we continue to leverage our scale on our industry leading cost base, to deliver free cash flow which over time will propel us on the path to deleveraging, investment grade credit ratings and higher ROIC.\"\n\nFourth Quarter 2022 Results and Statistical Information\n\nContinuing to close the gap to a strong 2019:\n\nFor the cruise segment, revenue per PCD for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 0.5% (3.8% in constant dollar) compared to a strong 2019, overcoming the dilutive impact of FCCs, and better than the third quarter of 2022 which decreased 4.1% (2.1% in constant dollar) compared to 2019.\n\nOccupancy in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 19 percentage points below 2019 levels, on capacity in guest cruise operations approaching 2019 levels.

This was better than the third quarter which was 66% of 2019 levels, an improvement of 14 percentage points. Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below) continued its sequential quarterly improvement in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a 7.2% increase (11% in constant currency) as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, down from a 25% increase (same in constant currency) in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2019. Costs remain higher as a result of higher advertising investments to drive 2023 revenue as well as partially mitigating the impacts of a high inflation environment. This was in line with the previous guidance of a low double-digit increase in constant currency.\n\nChanges in fuel price, fuel mix and currency rates unfavorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2022 by $267 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Total customer deposits hit a fourth quarter record of $5.1 billion as of November 30, 2022 , surpassing the previous record of $4.9 billion as of November 30, 2019 .\n\nFleet Optimization\n\nThe company expects to remove three additional smaller-less efficient ships from its fleet. Two of these three ships are from Costa Cruises' (\"Costa\") fleet as part of the company's strategy to right-size the brand in light of the continued closure of cruise operations in China, and Costa's significant presence there prior to the pause in the company's guest cruise operations. Once completed in spring 2024, the company's fleet optimization strategy will have reduced Costa's capacity so that it approximates the 2019 capacity Costa dedicated outside of Asia to its core markets in Continental Europe.\n\nThe company now expects total capacity growth of 3% for 2023 compared to 2019, at the lower end of the previous guidance range of 3% to 5%. The prudent capacity growth rate includes the benefit that newly delivered ships will represent nearly a quarter of the company's capacity.\n\nBookings\n\nBooking volumes during the fourth quarter of 2022 for 2023 sailings are nearing 2019 comparable booking levels, with November booking volumes exceeding 2019 levels. The company's North America and Australia (\"NAA\") segment's fourth quarter 2022 booking volumes for 2023 exceeded the comparable period in 2019. The company's Europe and Asia (\"EA\") segment's fourth quarter 2022 bookings for 2023 were lower than the comparable period in 2019. However, reflecting the closer-in booking pattern of its Continental European brands, its fourth quarter 2022 bookings for fourth quarter sailings significantly exceeded the comparable period in 2019. Further, the company continues to see an extension of its EA segment's booking curve, facilitating more optimal revenue yields over time.\n\nMarking an early start to wave season (peak booking period), the company ended the year with multiple brands breaking records on very strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday booking volumes. The company's full year 2023 cumulative advanced booked position is at higher prices in constant currency, normalized for FCCs, as compared to strong 2019 pricing with a booked position that is higher than the historical average. During the second half of 2022, the company significantly increased its advertising activities to support booking volumes. (The company's current booking trends are compared to booking trends for 2019 as it is the most recent full year of guest cruise operations.)\n\nFinancing and Capital Activity\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the company continued its efforts to address future debt maturities while paying down its multi-currency revolving credit facility. The company:\n\nCompleted a $2.0 billion private offering of Senior Priority Notes due 2028.\n\nprivate offering of Senior Priority Notes due 2028. Issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2027.\n\naggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. Exchanged an additional $87 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \"Existing Notes\") for the same amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, extending maturities at the existing rate of 5.75% and the same initial conversion price as the Existing Notes.\n\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter the company invested $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, repaid $2.5 billion of borrowings outstanding under its $2.9 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, repaid $1.0 billion of debt principal and incurred $0.4 billion of interest expense, net during the quarter. The company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $8.6 billion of liquidity, including cash, restricted cash from the 2028 Senior Priority Notes which is now unrestricted, and borrowings available under the revolving credit facility.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\n\nExpanding Air Lubrication Systems (\"ALS\") to generate savings in fuel consumption and reductions in carbon emissions\n\nBuilding on the success of five ALS currently operating in its fleet, the company is currently installing ALS on six ships and is planning at least eight more installations. ALS cushion the flat bottom of a ship's hull with air bubbles which reduces the ship's frictional resistance and the propulsive power required to drive the ship through the water, which is expected to generate approximately 5% savings in fuel consumption and reductions in carbon emissions on ALS equipped ships. Together, this investment along with various other company initiatives, has enabled the company to increase its expectation for the reduction of both fuel consumption per ALBD and carbon emissions per ALBD to 15%, on an annualized basis, both as compared to 2019.\n\nCarnival Chief Maritime Officer William Burke noted, \"The installation of air lubrication technology is another example of our ongoing efforts to drive energy efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and emissions throughout our fleet. We look forward to expanding the ALS program and furthering our long-term sustainability strategy to continually invest in a broad range of energy reduction initiatives, which has included over $350 million invested in energy efficiency improvements since 2016.\"\n\nCarnival Corporation & plc Boards of Directors focus on mix of skills, experiences and diversity\n\nThe Boards of Directors regularly evaluate the composition of the Boards to ensure the appropriate mix of skills, experiences, and diversity of perspectives to effectively oversee the strategic direction of Carnival Corporation & plc. During the quarter, Sara Mathew, retired Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Dun & Bradstreet Corp., was appointed to the company's Boards of Directors and Audit Committees. Mathew is an experienced leader and strategic operator with expertise in technology and innovation, finance, and global consumer-facing brands. Additionally, during the quarter, long-time Board member Sir John Parker made the decision not to seek re-election to the Boards of Directors at the 2023 Annual Meetings of Shareholders and will retire from the Boards with effect from the conclusion of the 2023 Annual Meetings of Shareholders. With these changes, as well as the recently announced retirement of long-time Board member and former President and CEO Arnold Donald, the company's Boards will be comprised of twelve members as of April 2023, ten of whom are independent directors, four of whom are female and one of whom is ethnically diverse.\n\nOther Recent Highlights\n\nCarnival Corporation & plc and its brands received the following recognitions:\n\nCarnival Corporation was named one of the World's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of the World's Best Employers of 2022 by Forbes, both for the second consecutive year, along with one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity by Newsweek.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line was a big winner in Travel Weekly's Readers' Choice Awards, taking home top honors in four categories Best Family Cruise Line, Best Group Program, Best Short Itinerary Program, as well as Best Domestic Cruise Line for the seventh year in a row.\n\nOther Best in Cruise Line Travel Weekly's Readers' Choice Awards received by our brands include amongst others:\n\nAlaska : Princess\n\n: Princess\n\nUnder 1,000 Berths: Seabourn\n\nWorld Cruise Itinerary: Holland America Line\n\nBest Shipboard Tech: Princess\n\nPrincess Cruises was awarded Best Premium Cruise Line by Australian Cruise Passenger Magazine.\n\nSeabourn celebrates another banner year after receiving 29 top travel industry awards and accolades including Cond Nast Travel Gold List: The Best Cruise Ships in the World: Seabourn Encore.\n\nP&O Cruises (UK) was awarded Best Cruise Line for Family Holidays by the British Travel Awards.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line took delivery of Carnival Celebration , sister to Mardi Gras .\n\n, sister to .

These statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. We have tried, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like \"will,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"believe,\" \"depends,\" \"expect,\" \"goal,\" \"aspiration,\" \"anticipate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"future,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"target,\" \"indicate,\" \"outlook,\" and similar expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms.\n\nForward-looking statements include those statements that relate to our outlook and financial position including, but not limited to, statements regarding:\n\nPricing Liquidity and credit ratings Booking levels Adjusted earnings per share Occupancy Adjusted EBITDA Interest, tax and fuel expenses Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Currency exchange rates Estimates of ship depreciable lives and residual values Goodwill, ship and trademark fair values\n\nBecause forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. This note contains important cautionary statements of the known factors that we consider could materially affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently, and in the future may continue to be, amplified by our substantial debt balance as a result of the pause of our guest cruise operations. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nEvents and conditions around the world, including war and other military actions, such as the current invasion of Ukraine , inflation, higher fuel prices, higher interest rates and other general concerns impacting the ability or desire of people to travel have led, and may in the future lead, to a decline in demand for cruises, impacting our operating costs and profitability.\n\nPandemics have in the past and may in the future have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations.\n\nIncidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise industry have in the past and may, in the future, negatively impact the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage.\n\nChanges in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection, labor and employment, and tax have in the past and may, in the future, lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage.\n\nFactors associated with climate change, including evolving and increasing regulations, increasing global concern about climate change and the shift in climate conscious consumerism and stakeholder scrutiny, and increasing frequency and/or severity of adverse weather conditions could adversely affect our business.\n\nInability to meet or achieve our sustainability related goals, aspirations, initiatives, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to risks that may adversely impact our business.\n\nBreaches in data security and lapses in data privacy as well as disruptions and other damages to our principal offices, information technology operations and system networks and failure to keep pace with developments in technology may adversely impact our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and may lead to reputational damage.\n\nThe loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified shoreside and shipboard employees and increased labor costs could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nIncreases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs.\n\nWe rely on supply chain vendors who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers are also affected by COVID-19 and may be unable to deliver on their commitments which could negatively impact our business.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results.\n\nOvercapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may negatively impact our cruise sales, pricing and destination options.\n\nInability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests.\n\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy following our resumption of guest cruise operations would negatively impact the occupancy levels and pricing of our cruises and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including those beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate cash required to service our debt and sustain our operations.\n\nThe ordering of the risk factors set forth above is not intended to reflect our indication of priority or likelihood.\n\nForward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant stock exchange rules, we expressly disclaim any obligation to disseminate, after the date of this document, any updates or revisions to any such forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based.\n\nForward-looking and other statements in this document may also address our sustainability progress, plans, and goals (including climate change- and environmental-related matters). In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability- and climate-related statements may be based on standards and tools for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions and predictions that are subject to change in the future and may not be generally shared.\n\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS) (UNAUDITED) (in millions, except per share data)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nNovember 30,\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\nNovember 30,\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2021 Revenues\n\nPassenger ticket $ 2,269\n\n$ 674\n\n$ 7,022\n\n$ 1,000 Onboard and other 1,570\n\n613\n\n5,147\n\n908\n\n3,839\n\n1,287\n\n12,168\n\n1,908 Operating Costs and Expenses\n\nCommissions, transportation and other 489\n\n153\n\n1,630\n\n269 Onboard and other 468\n\n178\n\n1,528\n\n272 Payroll and related 580\n\n475\n\n2,181\n\n1,309 Fuel 580\n\n282\n\n2,157\n\n680 Food 277\n\n107\n\n863\n\n187 Ship and other impairments 433\n\n67\n\n440\n\n591 Other operating 840\n\n560\n\n2,958\n\n1,346\n\n3,665\n\n1,823\n\n11,757\n\n4,655 Selling and administrative 741\n\n580\n\n2,515\n\n1,885 Depreciation and amortization 568\n\n552\n\n2,275\n\n2,233 Goodwill impairments\n\n226\n\n226\n\n4,974\n\n3,180\n\n16,547\n\n8,997 Operating Income (Loss) (1,135)\n\n(1,893)\n\n(4,379)\n\n(7,089) Nonoperating Income (Expense)\n\nInterest income 40\n\n2\n\n74\n\n12 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest (448)\n\n(348)\n\n(1,609)\n\n(1,601) Gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net (1)\n\n(298)\n\n(1)\n\n(670) Other income (expense), net (57)\n\n(87)\n\n(165)\n\n(173)\n\n(466)\n\n(731)\n\n(1,701)\n\n(2,433) Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (1,601)\n\n(2,624)\n\n(6,080)\n\n(9,522) Income Tax Benefit (Expense), Net 3\n\n4\n\n(14)\n\n21 Net Income (Loss) $ (1,598)\n\n$ (2,620)\n\n$ (6,093)\n\n$ (9,501)\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nBasic $ (1.27)\n\n$ (2.31)\n\n$ (5.16)\n\n$ (8.46) Diluted $ (1.27)\n\n$ (2.31)\n\n$ (5.16)\n\n$ (8.46) Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding - Basic 1,259\n\n1,135\n\n1,180\n\n1,123 Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding - Diluted 1,259\n\n1,135\n\n1,180\n\n1,123\n\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) (in millions)\n\nNovember 30,\n\n2022\n\n2021 ASSETS\n\nCurrent Assets\n\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,029\n\n$ 8,939 Restricted cash 1,988\n\n14 Short-term investments\n\n200 Trade and other receivables, net 395\n\n246 Inventories 428\n\n356 Prepaid expenses and other 652\n\n379 Total current assets 7,492\n\n10,133 Property and Equipment, Net 38,687\n\n38,107 Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets 1,274\n\n1,333 Goodwill 579\n\n579 Other Intangibles 1,156\n\n1,181 Other Assets 2,515\n\n2,011\n\n$ 51,703\n\n$ 53,344 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nCurrent Liabilities\n\nShort-term borrowings $ 200\n\n$ 2,790 Current portion of long-term debt 2,393\n\n1,927 Current portion of operating lease liabilities 146\n\n142 Accounts payable 1,050\n\n797 Accrued liabilities and other 1,942\n\n1,641 Customer deposits 4,874\n\n3,112 Total current liabilities 10,605\n\n10,408 Long-Term Debt 31,953\n\n28,509 Long-Term Operating Lease Liabilities 1,189\n\n1,239 Other Long-Term Liabilities 891\n\n1,043 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nShareholders' Equity\n\nCarnival Corporation common stock, $0.01 par value;

(b) ALBD is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period that we use to approximate rate and capacity variances, based on consistently applied formulas that we use to perform analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary. ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period. (c) Occupancy, in accordance with cruise industry practice, is calculated using a numerator of PCDs and denominator of ALBDs, which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers. Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins. (d) Fuel consumption in metric tons per thousand ALBDs for 2021 is not meaningful.\n\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nData in the below table is compared against 2019 as it is the most recent year of full operations since 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the pause and resumption of guest cruise operations.\n\nConsolidated cruise costs per ALBD, adjusted cruise costs per ALBD and adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD were computed by dividing cruise costs, adjusted cruise costs and adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel by ALBD as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended November 30,\n\nTwelve Months Ended November 30,\n\n(dollars in millions, except costs per ALBD) 2022\n\n2022 Constant\n\nCurrency\n\n2019\n\n2022\n\n2022 Constant\n\nCurrency\n\n2019\n\nOperating costs and expenses $ 3,665\n\n$ 3,077\n\n$ 11,757\n\n$ 12,909\n\nSelling and administrative expenses 741\n\n667\n\n2,515\n\n2,480\n\nTour and other expenses (45)\n\n(76)\n\n(214)\n\n(296)\n\nCruise costs 4,362\n\n3,667\n\n14,058\n\n15,093\n\nLess\n\nCommissions, transportation and other (489)\n\n(595)\n\n(1,630)\n\n(2,720)\n\nOnboard and other (468)\n\n(481)\n\n(1,528)\n\n(2,101)\n\nGains (losses) on ship sales and\n\nimpairments (431)\n\n5\n\n(433)\n\n16\n\nRestructuring expenses (20)\n\n(10)\n\n(22)\n\n(10)\n\nOther (10)\n\n(10)\n\n(43)\n\nAdjusted cruise costs 2,944\n\n2,586\n\n10,436\n\n10,234\n\nLess fuel (580)\n\n(358)\n\n(2,157)\n\n(1,562)\n\nAdjusted cruise costs excluding\n\nfuel $ 2,364\n\n$ 2,449\n\n$ 2,228\n\n$ 8,278\n\n$ 8,435\n\n$ 8,672\n\nALBDs (in thousands) 21,532\n\n21,532\n\n21,753\n\n72,536\n\n72,536\n\n87,424\n\nCruise costs per ALBD $ 202.56\n\n$ 168.58\n\n$ 193.81\n\n$ 172.64\n\n% increase (decrease) vs 2019 20 %\n\n12 %\n\nAdjusted cruise costs per ALBD $ 136.71\n\n$ 118.89\n\n$ 143.87\n\n$ 117.07\n\n% increase (decrease) vs 2019 15 %\n\n23 %\n\nAdjusted cruise costs excluding\n\nfuel per ALBD $ 109.78\n\n$ 113.74\n\n$ 102.44\n\n$ 114.13\n\n$ 116.29\n\n$ 99.20\n\n% increase (decrease) vs 2019 7.2 %\n\n11 %\n\n15 %\n\n17 %\n\n(See Non-GAAP Financial Measures)\n\nCARNIVAL CORPORATION & PLC NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nNovember 30,\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\nNovember 30, (in millions) 2022\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2021 Net income (loss)\n\nU.S. GAAP net income (loss) $ (1,598)\n\n$ (2,620)\n\n$ (6,093)\n\n$ (9,501) (Gains) losses on ship sales and impairments 431\n\n292\n\n433\n\n802 (Gains) losses on debt extinguishment, net 1\n\n298\n\n1\n\n670 Restructuring expenses 20\n\n7\n\n22\n\n13 Other 77\n\n69\n\n130\n\n86 Adjusted net income (loss) $ (1,068)\n\n$ (1,955)\n\n$ (5,508)\n\n$ (7,931) Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 448\n\n348\n\n1,609\n\n1,601 Interest income (40)\n\n(2)\n\n(74)\n\n(12) Income tax (expense), benefit (3)\n\n(4)\n\n14\n\n(21) Depreciation and amortization 568\n\n552\n\n2,275\n\n2,233 Adjusted EBITDA $ (96)\n\n$ (1,060)\n\n$ (1,684)\n\n$ (4,129)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nNovember 30,\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\nNovember 30, (in millions, except per share data) 2022\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2021 Adjusted net income (loss) $ (1,068)\n\n$ (1,955)\n\n$ (5,508)\n\n$ (7,931) Weighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 1,259\n\n1,135\n\n1,180\n\n1,123 Adjusted earnings per share $ (0.85)\n\n$ (1.72)\n\n$ (4.67)\n\n$ (7.06)\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe use adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measures of the company's financial performance.

Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for these items to be excluded from our net income (loss) and earnings per share, and accordingly, we present adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items as additional information to investors.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our operating profitability by excluding certain gains and expenses that we believe are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance as well as excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization. In addition, we believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about our ability to operate our business in compliance with the covenants set forth in our debt agreements. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization. There are material limitations to using adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items that directly affect our net income (loss). These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income (loss) as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nAdjusted cruise costs per ALBD and adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or ALBD changes from price and other changes that affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our cost performance as a supplement to our U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements. Adjusted cruise costs per ALBD and adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are the measures we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments' costs rather than cruise costs per ALBD. We exclude our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees, as well as fuel expense to calculate adjusted cruise costs without fuel. Substantially all of our adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices once the number of ALBDs has been determined.\n\nThe presentation of our non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. It is possible that our non-GAAP financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.\n\nReconciliation of Forecasted Data\n\nWe have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted U.S. GAAP gross cruise costs to forecasted adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel or forecasted U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to forecasted adjusted EBITDA or forecasted adjusted net income (loss) because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP forecasts of gross cruise costs and net income (loss) would require unreasonable effort. We are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. We are unable to determine the future impact of gains and losses on ship sales, impairment charges, gains and losses on debt extinguishments, restructuring costs and certain other non-core gains and losses.\n\nConstant Dollar and Constant Currency\n\nOur operations primarily utilize the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition. Functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk. Our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency, which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk.\n\nWe report adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD on a \"constant currency\" basis assuming the 2022 periods' currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2019 periods' rates. These metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates.\n\nConstant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations.\n\nConstant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations (as in constant dollar) plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe translation of our operations with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar to our U.S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies.\n\nOur operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. If their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies, it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses. If the functional currency weakens against these other currencies, it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses.\n\nSOURCE Carnival Corporation & plc",

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, reported being targeted by at least nine Russian drones overnight on November 26, one day after Russia launched a massive wave of drones against Kyiv and other sites. It was the biggest such attack since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry reported at least 24 Ukrainian drones that it claimed were downed over Tula, Kaluga, and Bryansk, as well as the Russian capital. No major damage was reported in any of the locations.\n\n\"A mass drone attack was attempted overnight,\" Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a post to Telegram.\n\nAndrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, wrote on Telegram that three unspecified buildings were damaged, but there were no injuries.\n\nIn Tula, south of Moscow, one person was wounded when an intercepted drone hit an apartment building, regional Governor Aleksei Dyumin said, also in a Telegram post.\n\nAs of the afternoon of November 26, Ukrainian officials had made no immediate comment on the reported attacks.\n\nThe Russian Army also said it had downed two Ukrainian missiles over the Azov Sea that it said were headed for Russia. Russia controls the Ukrainian Azov Sea coast, which fell to Moscow early in its offensive last year.\n\nLocal authorities in the affected regions did not report casualties.\n\nUkraine has upped attacks on Russia since launching its counteroffensive, aiming to hit regions close to fighting zones as well as further inland into Russia, including Moscow.\n\nFlights were delayed or canceled at several of Moscows major airports due to the attack, the Kommersant newspaper reported.\n\nUkrainian officials made no comment on the reported attacks, which came one day after Russia launched its own major drone attack on the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian officials said more than 70 were brought down or intercepted by air defenses.\n\nUkraine's military said on November 26 that it had shot down eight of nine Russian attack drones, which targeted various locations.\n\nOn the battlefield, fighting has focused around the industrial hub of Avdiyivka, which appears almost encircled by Russian forces. Its fall would be a significant loss for Kyiv.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, reported Russian attacks in the south and east of the country, saying the situation remains difficult.\n\nRoman Mrochko, head of the military administration in the southern city of Kherson, said two urban districts were shelled, while regional authorities said around a dozen villages were left without electricity due to bad weather and Russian attacks.\n\nUkraine has been bracing for an expected increase in Russian attacks targeting its energy infrastructure now that winter weather has set in. That would echo Moscow's campaign last winter that, at times, left millions of Ukrainians in cold and darkness and destroyed critical power facilities.\n\n\"Due to bad weather and Russian shelling, a number of settlements in our region were left without electricity,\" Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram. \"Power supply teams are already working to eliminate the malfunctions,\" he added.\n\nNearly 400 localities are without electricity in Ukraine due to \"extremely difficult\" weather conditions, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.\n\nOleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Ukraines presidential office, warned that the weather is worsening with heavy snowfalls expected in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, and Odesa regions.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters",

                "cc_text": "According to Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), February and March were the hardest months when Ukraine's fate hinged on making the right decisions and proper actions. He remembers the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion when the situation was very complicated, but he had no fear. It became a little easier in April, after the Ukrainian army repelled the Russians from Kyiv and kicked them out of Kyiv Region. Danilov notes that the Kremlin is still determined to take Kyiv and trying to persuade Aliaksandr Lukashenka, the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, to join the Russian forces in the war against Ukraine. The latter is still reluctant as he is aware of the inevitable consequences. The same can be said of Iran, whose ballistic missiles Russia wants to receive in order to replenish its badly depleted missile arsenal. Kyiv Post asked Danilov what is in store for the Kremlin under the circumstances, whether China is helping Russia and whether Moscow has managed to circumvent sanctions to enable it to manufacture weapons. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, recently warned that Russia is gearing up for a new offensive on Kyiv. What is happening on the northern front? We are preparing for any developments. Each section of the frontline is important and none is left without attention and control of the General Staff. We know what is happening in the temporarily-occupied territories of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk Regions, and Belarus. More on this topic Russian Troops Complain of Logistics Threat from Ukrainian Bridgeheads Citing accounts from front-line troops, Russian milbloggers have raised concerns over logistics vulnerabilities amidst Ukraines offensive east of the Dnipro River near Kherson. Do you see any activity in Belarus? Activity started back on Feb. 24 and hasn't stopped anywhere. Russia continues to rape Belarus. It's hard to say if the Belarusians will go to fight against our people, because it depends on many factors that we don't have influence over. But we know for sure that the Belarusians don't want to fight against us. Weve never done anything bad to them. Should people evacuate from Kyiv Region because of a possible new offensive from Belarus? It's a matter of personal choice. The people can make their own decisions, receiving the colossal amount of information from TV, radio, social networks and other sources. In Ukraine, unlike Russia, all information is freely accessible. At the moment, I can't take on the responsibility and tell people to evacuate or stay. It's up to them to decide individually. But in the event of a real threat the authorities will provide all the necessary information and will react in the proper manner.\n\nToday Russia doesn't get substantial, powerful support from China.\n\nWhat do you know about the recent meetings between Lukashenka and Putin? How much did they mention Ukraine and how did Lukashenka respond to the Kremlin's urge for Belarus to join the war? This wasn't the first time that Putin tried to drag Lukashenka into the bloody meatgrinder. I say once again: Lukashenka understands that if he goes for it, he is finished, and very soon too. No-one in Ukraine, Belarus or elsewhere in the world will forgive him. I can say that Belarus and Russia have entirely different visions. They are different nations, even though Russia says they are fraternal. Do you mean Lukashenka once again gave no clear answer to Putin? I don't know what he gave or didn't give. We look at actions. What do they show? The actions show that there's no final agreement yet. But it doesn't mean Putin won't keep trying to pressure Lukashenka. Some residents of Kyiv Region who were under Russian occupation in the spring say that after Feb. 24 they saw Belarusian soldiers together with Russians. Besides, Belarus provides its territory to Russia for missile strikes on Ukraine and the deployment of Russian troops, weapons and equipment. Why do we continue to say that Minsk hasn't officially entered the war yet? Because we know what we say. When you say that someone saw some Belarusians there, I can just as well say that someone saw aliens. There were no people in Belarusian military uniform. If they had been there, then there would have been photos. I have been in Kyiv since Feb. 24. In the first two weeks I got huge volumes of information from a great number of people that helped us, but there wasn't a single case of any Belarusian military presence. Belarus is occupied by the Russian Federation. The Russian military behave there as though they are in their own backyard. When, God forbid, Minsk decides to start military action, we will react. In which frontline sections, apart from Bakhmut, can Russian forces step up operations? In all of them. We have the frontline, and the enemys forces can act this or that way in any of its sections. We need to hold the line along the entire front. What do you know about Russian armaments? Do they continue to manufacture weapons and missiles or are they unable to do this because sanctions leave them without components? They are unable to manufacture precision weapons and they are running out of missiles. They only have sufficient amounts of missiles for S-300 launchers, but those missiles are not long-range ones. That's why Russia is holding talks with Iran on supplies of missiles. At the moment, Russia hasn't received any, but as soon as it does, we'll know about it.\n\nWe know for sure that the Belarusians don't want to fight against us.\n\nWhat is holding Iran back from supplying missiles to Russia? If Iran resorts to such a step, the international community will definitely respond. Iran has been under sanctions since 1979, but, as we can see, it has been able to bypass sanctions. After the war, we'll find out how Iran has managed to manufacture the kamikaze drones that it sends to Russia. I think in the near term we'll know what companies have supplied parts for them and why. Is it true that some Iranian companies that make drones are owned by Russians? Where did you get this information? We were told of this by Oleksandr Novikov, head of the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption. We don't have such information. Has Russia used missiles produced in 2022 yet? Yes, there have been fresh missiles. But they are unable to produce such missiles in large quantities. It's a complicated technological process. So, can we say that Russia has also learned to bypass sanctions? Now they are using up the remainder of previously stored parts and we know how many missiles they can still make. If brand-new missiles appear, then we'll say that sanctions don't work. So far, we can't say so. Are there facts of illegal Chinese supplies of weapons or technologies to Russia? No-one can answer this question today. I can only say that today Russia doesn't get substantial, powerful support from China. We'll see what happens tomorrow.\n\nWe dont fight against the church. We fight against those who harm our state, who support and collaborate with the invaders.\n\nCan China influence the Kremlin with regard to the war against Ukraine? Of course it can. In fact, China will subjugate Russia if the West doesn't draw the right conclusions. In 1994, Russia guaranteed our security and, at the request of our partners, we handed our huge arsenal of nuclear weapons over to Russia. Russia is now blackmailing us and the whole world with nuclear weapons. In the 1990s, instead of supporting Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other [post-Soviet] countries, the West decided to make Russia the security monopolist in the post-Soviet space except for the Baltic States. That was their big mistake. I think they understand it now. As long as there are nuclear weapons on Russian territory, Ukraine and the whole world cannot be safe. Matches, sharp things and weapons must be taken away from a madman. Is there a threat of China becoming a new monopoly in the Asian region? We are talking about different things here. China already has nuclear weapons and a powerful defense industry. The issue here is whether China will seize Russia or part of it. That's a big question and a challenge to the world. This summer, Russia repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. Then it went silent. What happened? It went silent after China warned it against such a step. The Russians always show obedience to China. Do you see any strange movements in Russian totalitarianism that may provoke the collapse of the Russian Federation? Russia will definitely collapse, and they are striding towards the end. They are destroying their own country. From the very day they decided to unleash this war against Ukraine, Russia will not exist in its present form and within its present borders. Could the Ukrainian army reach Russian territory to defend Ukraine? Yes, definitely. If theres a need to be where we need to defend our country, we will be there, and we won't ask anybody. All that talk about provoking someone is sheer nonsense.\n\nWe have the frontline, and the enemys forces can act this or that way in any of its sections. We need to hold the line along the entire front.",

He said the security services should quickly thwart any attempt to violate Russia's borders, combat risks coming from abroad, and identify traitors and saboteurs.\n\nHe also said the special services should ensure the safety of people living in the parts of Ukraine that Moscow claims as its own. In some of these areas, most notably Kherson, Russia recently suffered significant military reverses.\n\nRussia's defence ministry announced that its troops stationed in Belarus would conduct joint military exercises with Belarus.\n\nReacting to this and the visit Mr Yenin confirmed: \"We are building up our defence lines all across the border with Russia and with Belarus.\"\n\nWhile Belarus has not become involved in the war directly, it did allow Russian troops to use its territory to launch the invasion in February.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRussia and Belarus held joint military drills near the Ukrainian border in February - just days before Russia's full-scale invasion\n\nMinsk is coming under increasing pressure from Moscow to step up its support in the \"special military operation\".\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the reports \"as totally stupid, groundless fabrications\".\n\nPresident Putin flew to Minsk for talks with Mr Lukashenko - the first time in three-and-a-half years the pair have met in Belarus.\n\nBelarus's authoritarian leader has been in power since 1994 but his re-election in 2020 has not been recognised by the EU.\n\nThe meeting between the two men has been described as a \"working visit\" and lasted for more than two hours.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference Vladimir Putin said Russia did not want to \"absorb\" anyone. He also said that unspecified \"enemies\" wanted to stop Russia's integration with Belarus.\n\nSpeaking later on Monday, US state department spokesperson Ned Price said Putin's statement was the \"height of irony\" given he was currently seeking to absorb Ukraine.\n\nSomething rare happened today: Vladimir Putin got on a plane and flew to Minsk. Now, President Putin and President Alexander Lukashenko meet a lot - but in Russia.\n\nFor the first time in three-and-a-half years, here was President Putin in Belarus. So why did he go and why now?\n\nThere were few clues at the joint press conference as the two leaders spoke a lot about economic relations, trade, but also security.\n\nPresident Putin indicated that some Belarusian military aircraft have been re-equipped to potentially carry nuclear missiles and that Russia is helping to train their crews.\n\nIn return, President Lukashenko thanked him for providing Belarus with an S-400 air defence system and Iskander ballistic missile system.\n\nThe word \"Ukraine\" was hardly mentioned - in public.\n\nBut the visit has fuelled speculation that the Kremlin leader may be trying to pressure the leader of Belarus into joining a possible new ground offensive in Ukraine.\n\nThis may indeed be just a rumour. Or a ploy by Moscow to make Ukraine expect a Belarusian offensive and so tie up Ukrainian soldiers in the north.\n\nBut, there are reportedly several thousand Russian soldiers already in Belarus and there have been joint exercises.\n\nUntil now Alexander Lukashenko has been reluctant to commit his own troops to fighting in Ukraine.",

Putin of Russia said on Tuesday that his government would ban Russian oil exports to any countries that agreed to the Western price cap put in place this month.\n\nThe announcement came in the form of a decree, signed by Mr. Putin and released by the Kremlin, saying that, starting on Feb. 1 and lasting for five months, no Russian oil would be sent to countries that honor the price cap.\n\n\"Deliveries of Russian oil and oil products to foreign entities and individuals are banned, on the condition that in the contracts for these supplies, the use of a maximum price fixing mechanism is directly or indirectly envisaged,\" the decree says, according to news agencies translations.\n\nThe impact of the move was like to be limited. The European Union, the region that is most dependent on Russian oil, has already banned most Russian oil imports, so the cap mainly affects buyers outside Europe.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, the Group of 7 wealthy democratic nations Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States and the European Union agreed at the beginning of December to cap the price of Russian crude oil at $60 per barrel. The move was aimed at weakening the Kremlins revenues and diminishing its financing for the war in Ukraine, without completely disrupting global supply at a time of soaring inflation.\n\nHowever, the cap is set close to Russias existing selling price, and some countries like Poland, Ukraines neighbor argued that it did not make much of a difference to the Kremlin. The cap is to be reviewed every two months.\n\nThe Kremlins defiant response to the cap on Tuesday was somewhat anticipated, since Moscow had already insisted that it would not sell oil subject to a price limit.\n\nA Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said this month that Russia was \"working on mechanisms\" to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.\n\n\"We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,\" Mr. Novak said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network.",

Peskov branded such allegations of Kyiv as \"groundless and stupid speculations.\"\n\nKyiv puts little store in what the Kremlin says, however.\n\nOn Sunday, the commander of Ukrainian joint forces Serhiy Nayev said in a video statement that Putin last week held an official meeting with the leadership of the Russian army, during which, \"he considered the proposals of the military command for the near and medium term.\"\n\n\"Immediately after that, he announced a meeting with the leadership of Belarus In our opinion, during this meeting, the issues of further aggression against Ukraine and wider involvement of the Armed Forces of Belarus in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, on land, will be worked out,\" Nayev said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting of the staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief on Sunday, during which its members \"considered the situation in Belarus.\"\n\n\"Information was heard about the actual number and armament of enemy military groups. The commanders noted the readiness of the defense forces to respond to any developments,\" the presidential media office said in a statement.\n\nThe meeting between Putin and Lukashenko was held against the background of a massive attack of Iranian-made drones on the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday, which damaged more energy infrastructure in the city.\n\n\"These are [drones] Shaheds from the new batch that Russia received from Iran. 250 items thats how many Shaheds have now been received by the terrorist state,\" Zelenskyy told the meeting of the leaders of the U.K.s Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) the same day.\n\nThe Ukrainian president urged British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak \"to increase the possibility\" of supplying air defense systems to help speed up decisions by other partners.",

Some states take years to do so, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko said at a meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg on 27 December, BelTA has learned.\n\n\"I thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, for Moscow, for the cosmonauts, for the center [the visit to the cosmonaut training center in the Star City near Moscow that is selecting a Belarusian candidate for a space flight out of six applicants]. I've been there, I've seen it. As for our stay in St. Petersburg. We did have a look at some things. Well, if someone, as you rightly said, thinks that we only drink tea, then I must say that yesterday we discussed a lot of issues not only over tea but also late at night when returning home. Sometimes it takes years for some states to discuss so many things over such a short period of time. Meanwhile we put many dots over the i' in the evening, continuing our Minsk dialogue, since it was mainly about the economy. I thank you for the fact that many issues were finalized yesterday. The governments will fine-tune them. They should not have any complaints any longer. We have reached agreements on all issues they asked for,\" the Belarusian head of state said.\n\nAleksandr Lukashenko also thanked his Russian counterpart for the cultural program: \"I thank you for the tour of the museum. You're absolutely right. Declaring the Year of the Russian Language was a right thing to do [2023 has been declared the Year of the Russian Language as a Language of Interethnic Communication in the CIS], this decision will emphasize its importance. I also thank you for showing us St. Petersburg yesterday. The city made an amazing impression on me. It is very clean. When I come back to Minsk, I will see to it that we catch up. It doesn't even feel like it's winter here. The city is so clean, spruced up. For several years I have been admiring the things that have been happening in St. Petersburg. Without your help, of course, they would be difficult to achieve. But still, kudos to the local administration too. There's a lot to learn from them.\"\n\nThe leaders of the CIS countries met for the informal summit in St. Petersburg on 26 December. First it was an official meeting, and then the heads of state attended an informal dinner on behalf of Vladimir Putin in honor of the leaders of the CIS countries. In general, the communication lasted more than seven hours.\n\nThe CIS heads of state met in the Russian Museum on 27 December. The program includes an informal breakfast and a tour of the museum.\n\nAs for the details of the communication between Aleksandr Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin, both presidents are staying in Strelna, the suburbs of St. Petersburg. In the morning, the Russian leader stopped by to pick up his Belarusian counterpart, after which they arrived together at the Russian Museum. The day before they also left together, which the Belarusian head of state mentioned about during the bilateral meeting in the museum.\n\nThe meeting of Aleksandr Lukashenko and Vladimir Putin took place in one of the halls of the Russian Museum against the backdrop of the paintings by great artists. Behind them we see the canvas \"The Appearance of Christ To the People\". This work is a small version of Alexander Ivanov's famous painting of the same name, which is kept in the Tretyakov Gallery. Originally the artist meant to create a painting of this size, but in the course of work he came to more monumental forms. The painting is inspired by the Gospel.",

The visit, which included a bilateral meeting and a joint press conference at the White House, has been hailed as a diplomatic success, serving to bolster the prospects of continued financial and military aid for Ukraine (1,2). During this visit, President Joe Biden announced nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine, highlighting the significant support the U.S. is providing, including a sophisticated new air defense system (2,3). The trip signifies that the Biden administration is not intending to change its approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, reinforcing the U.S. role as Ukraine's most crucial ally (4). However, Russian officials have criticized the visit, indicating that it is unlikely to advance peace talks, and some have responded with increased hostility towards Ukraine (5).",

Despite Russia's dismissive stance on the visit, seeing it as an aggravation of the conflict, the U.S. has solidified its role as Ukraine's most important ally, potentially influencing Kyiv's position in future negotiations (5,6,8). Zelenskyy's successful trip not only reinforces the bilateral relationship but also signals to Moscow the unwavering U.S. support, even though some of Ukraine's critical military requests remain unfulfilled (8,10)."

Russian officials perceive the visit and the increased U.S. aid as an empty gesture that fails to advance peace talks, with some calling for more aggressive action against Ukraine (2,5).",
                "summary": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the US has been characterized by the Biden administration as a show of unwavering support, with pledges of continued military and financial assistance to Ukraine for \"as long as it takes,\" which may embolden Ukraine's stance in the conflict (1). However, Russian officials have viewed the visit cynically, dismissing it as an empty gesture that does not advance the prospects for peace negotiations, while more extreme voices in Russia have called for increased aggression against Ukraine following the meeting (2). During the visit, President Biden is expected to announce nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine, including a sophisticated new air defense system, indicating a further escalation in support that could impact Ukraine's leverage in any potential negotiations (3,4). Despite these developments, the Kremlin has indicated skepticism that Kyiv's position on peace talks will change after Zelenskyy's trip to the US, suggesting that the visit may not directly lead to a shift in the dynamic of the peace negotiations (5).",
                "more_detailed": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington is seen as a significant diplomatic success, with U.S. President Joe Biden pledging ongoing financial and military support for Ukraine \"as long as it takes.\" This visit, which included a bilateral meeting and a joint press conference at the White House, also featured a promise of nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance for Ukraine, including a sophisticated new air defense system (1,3,4). The support from the U.S. is crucial for Kyiv as it continues to seek international backing in the conflict with Russia. However, Russian officials have dismissed the visit as an empty gesture, claiming it will not advance peace talks, with some hardliners even calling for Ukraine to be destroyed following Zelenskyy's engagement with U.S. officials (2).\n\nThe visit underscores the deepening commitment of the U.S. to Ukraine's cause, potentially hardening the stance of both nations against Russian aggression and leaving little room for immediate negotiations or a compromise peace (7,8). Secretary of State Blinken confirmed that the objectives of both the U.S. and Ukraine align, focusing on a free, independent, and democratic Ukraine, while peace terms remain firmly in the hands of Kyiv. He also noted that Ukraine is currently intent on reclaiming its eastern and southern territories occupied since February, with Russia showing \"no meaningful interest\" in diplomacy to end the war (10). Consequently, while the trip reinforces Ukraine's international alliances and may bolster its defensive capabilities, it also appears to signal a continued commitment to military resistance rather than a move towards peace negotiations with Russia (6,9)."

His trip, the first since the invasion's onset, coincides with a critical vote on further emergency aid for Ukraine and showcases allied solidarity in the face of Russian aggression, as evidenced by his previous frontline visit to Ukrainian troops in Bakhmut (3,5).",
                "summary": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington is a significant diplomatic gesture, underscoring the continued American commitment to Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia (2). During this historic visit, Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden at the White House, where Biden pledged enduring support for Ukraine and announced a substantial $1.8 billion security assistance package, including sophisticated air defense systems like the Patriot missiles (4). This meeting is set against the backdrop of Zelenskyy's recent visit to the front lines in Bakhmut, emphasizing Ukraine's resilience and the importance of U.S. aid in the conflict (3). The visit, which includes an address to Congress, demonstrates the urgency of further support as lawmakers consider a significant $45 billion emergency assistance package for Ukraine (3,5).",

This substantial aid package, including the transfer of the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, signifies a leap in the defensive capabilities afforded to Ukraine, allowing for enhanced protection against cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and aircraft (10).\n\nThe meeting between Presidents Biden and Zelenskyy, set against the backdrop of the year-end spending package that includes about $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine, represents a potent demonstration of American solidarity with Kyiv (3). The provision of the Patriot system, a pivotal element of the security assistance, is seen as a symbolic gesture of unwavering U.S. support rather than a transformative escalation in military aid (8). Despite Russian dismissal of the visit's importance, Zelenskyy's engagement in Washington serves to reinforce the narrative of Ukraine's resilience and the international community's commitment to deterring Russian aggression, while potentially impacting the dynamics of the ongoing conflict (9)."

The inclusion of the GLSDB further expands Ukraine's ability to strike at a distance and target a variety of Russian assets, thus contributing to the broader goal of degrading enemy forces and reclaiming lost territory (6). The combination of these systems represents a significant escalation in the defensive aid provided by the US and underscores the commitment to support Ukraine's fight for freedom and independence (2,9,10)."

During his time in Washington, Zelensky is set to engage in extended talks with President Joe Biden at the Oval Office, where Biden is expected to announce nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance, including a sophisticated new air defense system (1,6). The visit is not only a diplomatic success but also a strategic move to bolster the chances of ongoing support as the war continues, with Biden pledging assistance for \"as long as it takes\" (3,4).\n\nThe significance of Zelensky's trip is multifaceted, as it serves to strengthen international alliances and demonstrate Ukraine's resilience and determination in the face of Russian aggression (7,8). In addition to his White House meeting, Zelensky addressed members of Congress, where he was able to articulate the crucial nature of American support in achieving a turning point in the conflict (2). Despite Russian officials downplaying the visit's impact on peace talks and some calling for further aggression against Ukraine, Zelensky's journey highlights his transformation from a former comedian to a national hero and global symbol of resistance (5,7). Moreover, his presence in Washington, D.C., and his engagement with top U.S. officials and institutions serve as a powerful statement against Russian attempts to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and the international order (9,10)."

However, the system's size and expense mean that only a few units can be sent, limiting the breadth of its protection (3). Furthermore, the delivery of the Patriot system has been met with Russian assertions that it will not deter them from achieving their goals, indicating that the conflict is likely to continue with heightened intensity (7). Lastly, the advanced air defense system's arrival on the Ukrainian battlefield requires training for Ukrainian forces, which means its impact may not be immediate (9)."

The White House says they will help defend Ukrainians against \"Russia's barbaric attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure\".\n\nMoscow has complained that no calls for peace were heard during President Zelensky's trip to Washington - with spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing this as proof that the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia.\n\nMr Peskov added that delivering Patriot missiles would not prevent Russia from \"achieving its goals during the special military operation\".\n\n\"The talks in Washington have shown that neither Ukraine nor the United States is seeking peace. They are simply intent on continuing the fighting,\" said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.\n\nRussian commentators have echoed this - repeatedly accusing the US of \"pumping Ukraine full of weapons\".\n\nSome media reports from Moscow ridiculed the Ukrainian leader - with state TV's Channel One comparing him to a stripper begging for money. On Wednesday, he was likened to a toilet brush.\n\nMarking his first foreign trip since the start of the invasion, Mr Zelensky told Congress his country was \"alive and kicking\" and would never surrender to Moscow.\n\nAs well as the $1.85bn package that has already been announced, another $45bn of US emergency assistance is currently before the Senate.\n\nMr Zelensky expressed hope this extra funding would be approved, to \"help us to defend our values and independence\".\n\nBut there are signs that US support is likely to face greater political scrutiny. Republican support for continued assistance has been eroding.\n\nIn a survey conducted in November, just over half of Republican voters supported aid to Ukraine - down from 80% in March.\n\nThe party, which will take control of the House of Representatives in January, has warned it will not write a \"blank cheque\" for Ukraine.\n\nBut President Biden has vowed to stick by Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\".\n\nMr Zelensky, who travelled on a US Air Force jet from the Polish city of Rzeszow, said that \"regardless of changes in the Congress\", he believed there would be bipartisan support for his country.\n\nHe made his plea in emotive terms before a joint session of Congress - a speech that was interrupted 18 times with standing ovations by nearly all members of Congress, with the exception of some Republican lawmakers who did not clap.\n\nSpeaking in English, he told them his country was still standing \"against all odds\" and predicted \"a turning point\" in the conflict next year.\n\nTo illustrate the brutality of the war, Mr Zelensky evoked US troops fighting the Nazis during World War Two.\n\n\"The Russians' tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent convicts to the front lines, to the war. They threw everything against us, similar to the other tyranny, which in the Battle of the Bulge threw everything it had against the free world.\n\n\"Just like the brave American soldiers who held their lines and fought back Hitler's forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's forces this Christmas,\" he said. \"Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender.\"\n\nConcluding his speech, Mr Zelensky presented Congress with a battle flag signed by the defenders of Bakhmut, a frontline city in the east of Ukraine that he visited on the eve of his Washington trip.\n\nEPA\n\nMr Zelensky's visit to Washington was his first foreign trip since the start of Russia's invasion\n\nAt a joint news conference, Mr Biden told reporters he was \"not at all worried\" about holding the international coalition together.\n\nDespite concerns some allies may be feeling the strain of the conflict's cost and disruption to global food and energy supplies, the US president said he felt \"very good\" about the solidarity of support for Ukraine.\n\nAs Ukraine's most important ally, the US has already committed $50bn (41bn) of humanitarian, financial and security assistance - far more than any other country.\n\nOn his way home from Washington, Volodymyr Zelensky stopped in Poland where he met Polish President Andrzej Duda, one of his strongest allies.\n\nThe two discussed the US visit as well as their \"strategic plans for the future\", Mr Zelensky said.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the US military estimates that at least 100,000 Russian and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured, along with some 40,000 civilian deaths.",

Messages began to be shouted between the two sides. The following day, on Christmas, British and German soldiers met in no man's land and exchanged gifts, took photographs, and played impromptu games of football. They also buried casualties and repaired trenches and dugouts. After the short truce, fighting unfortunately carried on. Today, U.S. faith and peace leaders are calling for a Christmas ceasefire in Ukraine and demanding negotiations to end the war. | Imperial War Museum\n\nActivists and faith leaders in the United States are calling for an immediate Christmas season truce, a ceasefire, and talks to end the Ukraine-Russia conflict. They issued their call in the wake of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys address to the Congress on Wednesday.\n\nZelensky called for continued flows of U.S. arms into his country to fight the Russians and promised that the weapons would be put to use. \"We are alive and kicking and will never surrender,\" he declared. He said that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was not charity but an investment in security for the future.\n\nAt a meeting with Zelensky just prior to the Capitol speech, President Joe Biden vowed to back Ukraine with arms \"for as long as it takes.\" He also pledged to send new Patriot missiles, the most advanced in the U.S. military arsenal, to Ukraine.\n\nThis was coupled with approval in the Senate on Thursday of an unprecedented $850-billion military budget, swollen to historic levels by billions more for the Ukraine war and multi-billion-dollar guarantees to the U.S. armaments makers that if any decision they make to increase armament production causes them to lose money, the U.S. treasury will jump in with \"socialism for the rich\" and cover their losses.\n\nCompletely under the radar is this weeks call by more than 1,000 faith leaders demanding the Christmas season truce in Ukraine. Almost all of those leaders have, since the war began, strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting death and suffering of the Ukrainian people. They are also concerned, however, about U.S. culpability in the war and the refusal thus far in Washington to push for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the fighting.\n\nLed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Bishop William Barber, who leads the Poor Peoples Campaign, they recalled the Christmas truce in 1914 during the First World War. They declared: \"We urge our government to take a leadership role in bringing the war in Ukraine to an end through supporting calls for a ceasefire and negotiated settlement, before the conflict results in a nuclear war that could devastate the worlds ecosystems and annihilate all of Gods creation.\"\n\nCo-founder of Code Pink Medea Benjamin, one of the signers, said: \"There is nothing glorious about the Ukraine war. It is a lose-lose for everyone except weapons makers. Zelensky should be calling for peace. So should Putin. And Biden. And everyone else. #ChristmasTruceNow.\"\n\nBenjamin said the war \"must move from the battlefield to the negotiating tableno more dollars for war! Peace talks instead!\" Supplies of more advanced weaponry would \"only bring us closer to a direct war with Russiaand nuclear armageddon,\" she added.\n\nZelensky essentially told the Congress this week, however, that no peace would be possible and no ceasefire was possible until Russia pulls out of Ukraine altogether. He said he has a 10-point peace plan that he discussed with Biden but gave no details. Biden has also not disclosed any specifics of the supposed plan.\n\nA Biden administration spokesperson, retired Admiral John Kirby, said on MSNBC that the Zelensky plan was \"not really a peace plan but rather a framework within which discussion between Ukraine and the U.S. can be held.\"\n\nThe huge military budget is causing enormous problems in the U.S. already. First is the obvious diversion of funds away from programs to address social needs. In addition, existing critical funds are under threat. The trillion-dollar omnibus bill approved in the Senate this week does not specify what part of it can be used to provide more than $1.7 billion needed, for example, to keep Medicaid benefits flowing to those in need.\n\nFederal money for states that have opted into Obamacare could be endangered if there are not adequate funds allocated for that in the federal budget. Millions who rely on these benefits could be harmed.\n\nThe conflict is increasingly looks like the proxy war between the U.S. and Russia that many peace activists say it is. They have been saying that Ukraine is caught in the middle of a long-term battle that the U.S. is waging against Russia.\n\nWhile the U.S. announced billions in new weapons for the Ukraine war this week, Russia responded by announcing plans on Wednesday to increase the size of its army from one million to 1.5 million members, and government officials rolled out plans to create entirely new, \"better trained\" units.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO which is under the control of Washington, continues its plans to expandan expansion that is seen as a major cause of the war in the first place. Two countries are slated to soon become new members.\n\nRussias Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said his country needed to safeguard its security because of those NATO plans, which involve the incorporation of Finland and Sweden into the alliance.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov also responded this week to U.S. plans for sending more weapons into the conflict. He declared that the move would not \"bode well\" for Ukraine, as Russian bombardments continued to pound the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nThis news analysis published here reflects the views of the authors.\n\nCONTRIBUTOR John Wojcik John Wojcik is Editor-in-Chief of People's World.

Pool photo by Pavel Bednyakov\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin met with his Belarusian counterpart, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, on Monday, to discuss deepening the military and economic relationship between the two close allies, as fears grow in Ukraine that Moscow is preparing to launch a new offensive from Belarus.\n\nAppearing together after their talks, Mr. Putin and Mr. Lukashenko spoke about the need for the two nations to withstand Western economic pressure and maintain close military ties without explicitly tying those efforts to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Putin said the leaders discussed the creation of a \"unified defensive space,\" although he did not describe what that would entail. He also said they agreed to continue joint military exercises and to manufacture new military equipment. Mr. Lukashenko added that Russia was helping train Belarusian military pilots to fly planes with special payloads, without elaborating.\n\nMr. Lukashenko who relies heavily on Moscow for financial, fuel and security assistance to maintain his 28-year grip on power promised that Western nations \"will not be able to rip apart our relations,\" saying, \"They will only deepen.\"\n\nWhen Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, it used Belarus as a staging ground for its abortive assault on Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. While Mr. Lukashenko has allowed Moscow to use his territory to launch missiles and bombing runs against Ukraine, he has so far resisted pressure from the Kremlin to contribute his own troops to the war effort.\n\nBut even without such direct involvement, Ukrainian officials remain wary of Belaruss potential role. In recent days, Kyiv has repeatedly warned that Russian forces could be preparing a new offensive from Belarus aimed either at making another effort to seize Kyiv, which lies about 55 miles from the Belarusian border, or at disrupting the flow of Western arms into Ukraine from Poland.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov who insisted before the invasion that the troops Moscow had sent to Belarus were there for training exercises has played down speculation about Belaruss potential involvement in a new invasion. He told reporters on Monday morning that such reports were \"totally stupid, groundless fabrications.\"\n\nBut many military experts believe that Russias military, which has suffered a string of battlefield setbacks, has been so badly battered by nearly 10 months of war that it is no condition to launch a new offensive from Belarus, with or without the participation of Belarusian troops.\n\nAlthough Mr. Lukashenko, who was hosting Mr. Putin for the first time in three years, has not committed to stepping up his contributions to the Russian war effort, he made clear his nations reliance on Moscow as a military partner, saying Belarus was unable to defend its \"independence and sovereignty\" without Russia.\n\nIn an ironic remark that betrayed the two countries international isolation, Mr. Lukashenko called the two nations \"co-aggressors, the most harmful, toxic people on the planet.\"\n\nThe two leaders remarks mostly focused on economic issues. They announced a deal on the price of subsidized Russian gas deliveries to Belarus, a major help for Mr. Lukashenko, who said his country had to deepen its economic cooperation with Russia to withstand Western sanctions.\n\n\"Russia can do without us, but we cant without her,\" he said.\n\nWhile Belarus is deeply dependent on Russia a relationship that is so one-sided that Mr. Lukashenko last week had to dismiss as untrue talk that \"the Russians are already running everything\" Mr. Putin denied he was interested in annexing Belarus.\n\n\"Russia is not interested to absorb anyone,\" he said. \"Theres no point in it.\"\n\nAndrew Higgins contributed reporting.",

The men shook hands ahead of what were expected to be lengthy talks about the path forward in Ukraine.\n\n\"I am in Washington today to thank the American people, the President and the Congress for their much-needed support. And also to continue cooperation to bring our victory closer,\" Zelensky said in a post on his official Telegram channel.\n\n\"I will hold a series of negotiations to strengthen the resilience and defense capabilities of Ukraine. In particular, we will discuss bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and the United States of America with US President Joseph Biden,\" he said.\n\n\"Next year, we must return the Ukrainian flag and freedom to our entire land, to all our people,\" he said.\n\nThe trip, which US and Ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. After arriving in Poland by train, Zelensky flew to Washington aboard an American military aircraft, US officials said. He arrived in the US shortly after midday, a source familiar with his travels told CNN. A separate source said he landed at Joint Base Andrews, just outside the nations capital.\n\nHe will visit the Oval Office in the afternoon for extended talks with US President Joe Biden, who will announce he is sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine, including a sophisticated new air defense system. The two will convene a White House news conference before Zelensky addresses members of Congress on Capitol Hill in prime time.\n\nThe visit by the Ukrainian leader to Washington, expected to last only a matter of hours, amounts to a remarkable moment 10 months since Russias war in Ukraine began.\n\n\"The President really believes that as we approach winter, as we enter a new phase in this war, of Mr. Putins aggression, that this is a good time for the two leaders to sit down face to face and talk,\" said John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council, on \"CNN This Morning.\"\n\nPulled together quickly by American and Ukrainian officials over the past 10 days, the wartime visit is meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Bidens ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested.\n\nIt will also provide an opportunity for Biden and top American officials to sound out Zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end.\n\n\"(Biden) will reinforce the fundamental message on this trip to President Zelensky directly to the Ukrainian people, the American people and the world publicly that the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" a senior administration official said.\n\nA surprise visit\n\nBiden first discussed the prospect of Zelensky visiting Washington during a telephone call with the Ukrainian leader on December 11, an administration official said. A formal invitation was extended a week ago that Zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip.\n\nZelensky, who the official said was \"very keen\" to visit the US, determined those parameters met his needs, and the US set to work executing them. The trip was finally confirmed on Sunday.\n\n\"We are working in lockstep with him and his staff to make sure we can make this trip safely, both coming to the United States and coming back. We will continue to support his travel requirements as best we can,\" Kirby said.\n\nZelensky traveled to Poland by train as part of his journey to the United States on Wednesday. Video by CNN affiliate TVN in Poland captured the moment Zelensky arrived by train in Przemysl, near the Polish/Ukrainian border. Zelensky was then seen in a white 44 vehicle waiting to depart in a convoy.\n\nTight security has been enforced around Zelenskys visit amid concerns that Russia wants to incapacitate the Ukrainian president, a source close to the Ukrainian leader told CNN on Wednesday. According to the source, because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials as well as embassy staff in the US were not informed about the schedule of the visit.\n\nAccording to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. Scheduling also had to be worked with the White House to assess availability for this to happen, the source added.\n\nThe source additionally told CNN that Zelensky did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between Ukraine and the United States. Zelensky sees the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nWhen Zelensky arrives to the White House, he will meet for lengthy talks with Biden, along with key members of the US national security team. The official said Biden and Zelensky would engage in an \"in-depth strategic discussion on the way ahead on the battlefield,\" along with the training and capabilities Western partners are providing Ukraine, the sanctions they have imposed on Russia and economic and energy assistance to the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe two men will also discuss what ending the war may take a sensitive conversation that US officials have insisted will not involve pressuring Zelensky to accept any concessions.\n\n\"I have no doubt they are going to talk about President Zelenskys notion of a just peace and what that looks like, what are the components of that, and how do we help Ukraine get to that point,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"Mr. Putin is obviously not interested in diplomacy right now,\" he went on. \"Quite the contrary. Hes interested in killing more Ukrainian civilians.\"\n\nZelensky leaves Ukraine for first time since war began\n\nOver the course of the 10-month invasion, Zelensky has emerged as the international personification of Ukrainian resistance and has spent much of the year appealing to nations for support. He has remained inside his country for the duration of the war, a reflection both of his desire to rally alongside his besieged country and the precarious security situation he would face outside Ukraine.\n\nAs the war nears its one-year anniversary, however, international support for Ukraine is being tested. Sanctions on Moscow have contributed to higher energy prices, particularly in Europe, which is heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas. In the United States, Republicans who are poised to take control of the House of Representatives have signaled they wont quickly approve massive new assistance packages for Ukraine.\n\nOn the battlefield, Ukraine has retaken key cities and shown unlikely resistance to an unprepared and ill-equipped Russian army. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no indication he plans to ease up, and has been ruthless in targeting civilian energy infrastructure, lending a degree of misery to Ukraines cold winter.\n\nThe timing appeared ripe for Zelensky to make a dramatic gesture like slipping out of Ukraine for the first time since the invasion began. For Biden, the visit presents an opportunity to reinforce his convictions for supporting Ukraine, even as the war plods on.\n\n\"We know that the days ahead, the conflict will continue,\" the senior administration official said. \"The winter will be hard, and we will continue day-in, day-out to provide critical support to the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nNew military assistance includes crucial missile system\n\nThe new, $1.8 billion package Biden will unveil includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraines to fend of Russian air attacks. CNN was first to report the US was expected to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe official said US troops would train Ukrainians to use the system in a third country. CNN has previously reported the training would occur at a US Army base in Grafenwoehr, Germany.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nRussia has warned on unspecific \"consequences\" if the US provided Ukraine with Patriot missiles, viewing the shipments as further US engagement in the war. The official was clear, however, that Biden remained steadfast in keeping the United States out of direct conflict with Russia, despite the enhanced security assistance.\n\n\"The President has been very clear that we are going to lean forward and be robust in our support for Ukraine on the military, economic, energy and humanitarian fronts, but we are not seeking to engage in a direct war with Russia. And nothing about that will change tomorrow,\" the official said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n& 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "cc_text": "A top Pentagon official with oversight of Ukraine policy told VOA Thursday there is a \"heightened urgency\" for advanced training of Ukrainian forces, as the Pentagon announced that the U.S. will expand the number of Ukrainian troops it trains each month.\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia Laura Cooper told VOA that \"it's a completely different ballgame\" in terms of the skills of Ukrainian forces today compared to when the U.S. first began training Ukrainian forces after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.\n\nPentagon press secretary, Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters earlier Thursday that starting in January, the U.S. would increase its military combat training to larger, battalion-size Ukrainian units in Germany each month on \"advanced battlefield tactics\" including live-fire exercises.\n\n\"The winter is going to be a very dynamic time. I think some people think about the winter as a time to rest and refit, but we don't see any sign that the Ukrainians are going to hold up, and we certainly would expect that the Russians may try to also advance,\" Cooper said, speaking exclusively to VOA.\n\nThe U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions of dollars of military support, including air defense weapons ranging from Stingers, which are portable on foot, to the larger National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), which can provide air defense against short- to medium-range targets.\n\nCooper would not confirm VOAs reporting from U.S. officials this week that the United States is preparing to send the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine to help shoot down incoming Russian missiles.\n\n\"But I can affirm air defense is our top priority, and we are looking at a number of ways in which we can support Ukraine and its air defense needs. NASAMS was one piece of that,\" she said, adding that U.S. assistance has evolved to meet new battlefield needs.\n\nCooper also confirmed that the U.S. had sent Ukraine parts from an S-300 system to maintain their air defense abilities before NASAMS were in place.\n\n\"Last spring, we were sending the Ukrainians spare parts to keep their S-300 systems up and running. But with the NASAM systems, this is a really premier Western capability that the Ukrainians right off the bat have been able to operate incredibly effectively against Russian missile threats, and also Russian UAS threats,\" she said, using an abbreviation for \"unmanned aircraft systems,\" referring to drones.\n\nThe U.S. helped convince Slovakia to provide a complete S-330 system to Ukrainian forces in April, and in turn provided Slovakia with a Patriot missile system.\n\nThe U.S. currently is not planning to provide Ukraine with long-range precision munitions such as Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) guided missiles for their artillery rocket launchers. To date, the U.S has sent Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) munitions to use in these launchers. ATACMS have a range of about 300 kilometers, while GMLRS have a range of about 90 kilometers.\n\n\"At this point, we see the GMLRS as being highly effective at reaching the vast, vast array of targets that Ukraine needs to hit. So we're sticking with the GMLRS at this point,\" she told VOA.\n\nOn Russian tactics in Ukraine, Cooper said Moscow was essentially throwing their forces \"into the meat grinder without regard for the very high casualties that they're facing.\"\n\nA full transcript of the interview is below:\n\nVOA: I want to start by chatting about the recent announcement about the additional training facility going on in Germany of the Ukrainian forces. So, it sounds to me, as somebody who has covered the training at Yavoriv training grounds in Ukraine, it sounds like it's the same type of training that the U.S. was doing before the war broke out, is that what's going to be happening here essentially?\n\nCooper: Well, I think it is important to see this training as part of this continuum of training, and it's great that you got to witness what we were doing at Yavoriv, along with some of our allies after 2014. But at the same time, obviously, the context is so very different today. I mean, since February 24, we have done so much intense training of Ukrainians on specialized weapon systems. This is the United States but also allies across multiple countries in Europe. We now have a really robust training program that the British are leading in the U.K. That's individual training, and so what they are doing is enabling these new recruits and new soldiers to be able to have the proficiency they need to operate, and then that is combining with not just what the U.S. will be doing with this battalion-level combined arms training, but also what the EU and other allies are doing. So, you see the EU has its collective training program that is launching, along with several EU countries, including Germany and Poland. What's important about all of these different efforts is to know that they are all linked together and coordinated. And that's a role that commander of EUCOM [European Command] is playing in ensuring that we're all latched up in support of Ukraine.\n\nWATCH: Laura Cooper talks with VOA\n\nVOA: Got it. So similar training, heightened urgency is kind of what I hear from you?\n\nCooper: Heightened urgency, and also, you know, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are in a different place. Their proficiency on the battlefield is amazing. When we think about where we started with them in 2014, and where they are today in their capability, in their ability to push back on these Russian invaders. It's a completely different ballgame.\n\nVOA: Let's talk about some of the $19 billion-plus in military assistance that has been given to Ukraine since the start of this war. What do you find has been the most effective weapon that the Pentagon has provided to Ukraine?\n\nCooper: I think it's very hard to name one particular weapon because as the battlefield has evolved, we have been evolving our assistance to provide what the Ukrainians need when they need it. So, in those very early days after February 24, when you saw the Russians attacking on multiple axes, I would say that the Javelin and the Stinger were both capabilities that were absolutely critical in enabling the Ukrainians to repel that initial advance and kind of freeze Russian forces in their tracks, but later as the battlefield evolved to be more of an artillery fight in the east, it really was the HIMARS system and before that, our M777 howitzers that played a really decisive role.\n\nVOA: Let's talk about the HIMARS since you mentioned themfor our audience, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket systems. The U.S. has provided GMLRS rockets with a range of about 90 kilometers, 55 miles, so far. But there have been Ukrainians that want something longer-range, like the ATACMS. Is the Pentagon taking a serious look at providing that, and do you foresee that being something that is added in the Ukrainian packages of military aid in the future?\n\nCooper: So, we think it's important to note that we are always looking at Ukrainian battlefield needs, and we are always evaluating what are the best capabilities to provide them so that they can meet their operational requirements. At this point, we see the GMLRS as being highly effective at reaching the vast, vast array of targets that Ukraine needs to hit. So, we're sticking with the GMLRS at this point.\n\nVOA: But some would argue, and I was speaking with Lieutenant General Ben Hodges [Retired], who was the former commander of U.S. Army, and he was pointing out that the ATACMS, with a 300-kilometer range, could allow the Ukrainians to hit major areas in Crimea on that peninsula that they cannot hit with the GMLRS. So, what's your response to that? Is that not a capability that is considered the priority at this point, what's the real reason for not providing that?\n\nCooper: So, you cant just look at the one capability. There are other capabilities that the Ukrainians have available to them to reach other targets, and I think you've seen actually, strikes in Crimea, you've seen strikes in the Black Sea for that matter, with a range of capabilities. So, again, I would say, we believe that the capabilities we have provided to Ukraine enable them to reach the vast majority of targets that they need to, that they need to hit to meet their operational goals.\n\nVOA: As I've been speaking with people about the long-range precision capability, you hear two different arguments. There is one, there's a concern that Russia will see that as a further escalation, and that Russia will respond to this further escalation. And then there's the other side that feels like the long-range precision munitions are needed because Russia has so far had a sanctuary on its territory and that the Ukrainians, with the exception of what we've seen over the last few days, have not targeted any of their military or civilian capabilities. Where do you fall in the spectrum personally or where do you see that argument?\n\nCooper: Well, I think it's important to not be in the theoretical on the theoretical targets and the theoretical responses and focus really on what the Ukrainians need on the battlefield. And what you're seeing is their focus quite recently, it was Kherson, where they had a very effective advance and pushed the Russians back. We saw them up in Kharkiv, and now we see them in eastern Ukraine, fighting fiercely against Russian advances in Bakhmut. And we look at what capabilities do they need for these particular operational situations, and what capabilities are they using? And again, I would say that the HIMARS have been incredibly effective with the GMLRS at taking out key Russian command and control points, key Russian logistics nodes, and enabling the Ukrainians to not just hold their ground, but actually to advance.\n\nVOA: The British defense minister, I think, just recently said that he was open-minded to providing more longer-range weapon systems. How does the secretary feel about this? How do you feel about this or are you keeping an open mind about this moving forward as you talk with Ukrainians about what they need?\n\nCooper: Looking across all capabilities, we're always looking at what the Ukrainians need, and we always have an open mind about what that might be.\n\nVOA: So, yes, you are also like-minded.\n\nCooper: We are always open minded about capability needs for the gradients.\n\nVOA: So, I want to talk to you about something that Ukraine's foreign minister said this month. He said that Russia's ability to launch a major offensive might be restored in late January or February, in that timeline. Is the U.S. concerned about this possibility also, and what is the Pentagon trying to do to prevent that?\n\nCooper: So, we're always vigilant and looking at where Russia might next seek to push forward where what you know, operations they might be contemplating. The winter is going to be a very dynamic time. I think some people think about the winter as a time to rest and refit. But we don't see any sign that the Ukrainians are going to hold up and we certainly would expect that the Russians may try to also advance. The thing about the Russian situation right now, though, to keep in mind, is the very poor state of their forces. You're dealing with many forces that were hastily mobilized, received very little training, are very poorly equipped, and their morale is incredibly low. So even though we'll be very vigilant, and we'll be looking to support the Ukrainians with all of their capability needs, we also are cognizant that the Russians are struggling.\n\nVOA: Let's talk about that a little more. They have had setback after setback on the battlefield. So, you foresee that the Russians, as long as the Ukrainians keep bringing the fight to them, that they will not be able to regroup and relaunch - is that what I'm hearing? Explain kind of where you see the Russians in the future as this goes, because we know now that they're, they're in a dire situation with low morale, or do you see this projecting to January?\n\nCooper: Well, I think you have to look at two pieces of this. One is their brutal and devastating attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Clearly, the Russians have resorted to this tactic out of desperation, and out of complete apathy, for human rights for civilian rights and for global opinion. Yet they seem to keep up with this tactic. And so, I think we can foresee that Russia will continue to try to intimidate the Ukrainian civilian population and the Ukrainian government into you know, some sort of submission. That's not going to happen. I think the Ukrainians will stand firm, they will improve their resilience with all of the deliveries of both electrical equipment, but also of air defense equipment from the United States and allies. At the same time, the other prong of what Russia's strategy has been is to kind of push forward with their forces in attempting to eke out additional territorial games. I would certainly see them trying to continue to do this, but this is where their weaknesses in, you know, the strength of their forces, the morale of their forces, the capabilities that they have, will really be a hindrance, but the way Russia fights is different from how any of our allied militaries or the Ukrainians fight, they really are throwing their forces, throwing their individuals into the meat grinder without regard for the very high casualties that they're facing.\n\nVOA: Let's talk about the ability of the Ukrainian forces to defend the Ukrainian population. Right now, the U.S. just helped provide two NASAMS to Ukraine. These are the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems. And can you tell us a little bit about the success of those? What have they been doing? I heard from one analyst that it's like 35 attempts, 35 successful hits. Just talk about what you're hearing from the battlefield.\n\nCooper: Sure. And again, I want to put the NASAMS in a larger context of air defense because we're looking across the board at how we can enable Ukrainian air defense, and so, even way back last spring, we were sending the Ukrainians spare parts to keep their S-300 systems up and running. But with the NASAM systems, this is a really premier Western capability that the Ukrainians right off the bat have been able to operate incredibly effectively against Russian missile threats, and also Russian UAS threats. So, we've seen them be very successful in the last several waves of attacks, where again, Russia is trying to target Ukraine's energy grid, but they're failing.\n\nVOA: And Ukraine's Defense Ministry has recently raised the concern that they're still not fully capable of protecting themselves against the ballistic missiles, that is Skander ballistic missiles. And that is where we have heard and two U.S. officials have told VOA that the Pentagon is preparing to send Patriot missiles or Patriot missile batteries, to Ukraine to help with that, can you confirm that that is something that the Pentagon is preparing to do?\n\nCooper: I don't have any announcements for you on new air defense capabilities right now, but I can affirm air defense is our top priority and we are looking at a number of ways in which we can support Ukraine and its air defense needs. NASAMS was one piece of that. We're also talking with allies, and we've had tremendous support from allies in bringing capability to Ukraine. Whether you're talking about Germany's IRIS-T system or the fact that a host of allies have been providing the AMRAAM missiles that the NASAMS units are firing.\n\nVOA: C-RAMs also could be another option. Is that something that the Pentagon is considering?\n\nCooper: I don't have anything, anything to offer on that.\n\nVOA: Okay, and so, let me tell our audience, it's not kind of in the weeds about weapon systems. Can you just explain, should a Patriot missile battery come to Ukraine? Can you talk about what that would provide? Explain to our audience the difference that this capability could provide over some of the other ones that have already been given.\n\nCooper: Well, I'm not a technical expert to be able to get into details of different systems, but I think I can tell your listeners that air defense is not about one system in one point. Air defense is about having layers of systems that can target the range of threats, whether it's these Iranian UAVs that Russia has purchased that are menacing Ukraine cities, or it's these you know, cruise missiles coming from land from air or from sea, you have to have this layered approach with multiple systems, protecting at multiple points around the country.\n\nVOA: Since you mentioned Iran, what can you tell us about what Iran is continuing to provide Russia. They have so far denied that they have provided Russia weapons, but we can see in the debris that there are Iranian drones being used. So, what's the latest update on how much they've provided and what they've provided?\n\nCooper: So, every one of those Iranian UAS that menaces Ukraine skies is another capability that Russia would not have had if Iran had not come to Russia's assistance. Iran can't deny this. We've seen in fact in terms of the damage due to UAS and the Ukrainians have plenty of eyewitness accounts, where we see them bravely shooting these out of the sky, even with machine guns that we've provided them, so Iran does continue to source the Russian military with these UAVs. And we know that the relationship between Iran and Russia has grown significantly through the duration of the war in Ukraine.\n\nVOA: Have you seen Russia at all be able to replenish some of the things that it has lost? Or are they really severely depleted at this point?\n\nCooper: I think we've seen Russian defense industry is on its back heels. U.S. and allied export controls have helped starve the materials that Russian defense industry relies upon. At the same time, I know Russia is, they're trying to find additional sources they're trying to find ways to produce or acquire. But right now, we know they're in trouble because their two friends that they're turning to appear to be Iran and North Korea, and they lack other suppliers.\n\nVOA: And still no support from China at this point that you've seen?\n\nCooper: I don't have any information on support from China.\n\nVOA: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you just more about the weapons that the U.S. has been providing. One of the things we haven't seen yet are fighter jets. Is that under consideration and if not, why not?\n\nCooper: Again, the full range of capabilities are under consideration, and we're open to, but our focus has really been on what can Ukrainians use now? And we know that they need air defense now. So, we're very focused on that. We know they need fires, long-range fires, artillery, including HIMARS and ammunition to support them. We know they need armored vehicles to move around. So, these are the kinds of capabilities that we've been very, very focused on. And for the air domain, we've been focused on UAS that they can field very quickly and effectively to inflict damage on Russian positions. With aircraft, that certainly is something that the Ukrainians have shown a proficiency to operate, their MiGs have been in the fight and so we've decided to further enable their MiGs, and that's where these HARM missiles that we've provided them, which anti-radiation missiles that we've provided Ukraine have come into play. We've also provided a lot of spare parts to help keep those MiGs flying. And that's all about enabling the capability that can be used immediately, as opposed to capabilities that would take a lot of training and have a lot of work on maintenance and sustainment.\n\nVOA: And that is something that critics have said a Patriot would take. As I understand it, it would take at least six months to train somebody to use the Patriot. It took several months for the NASAMS, correct? It took at least a couple months.\n\nCooper: Honestly, I don't recall exactly how long it took. But I mean for most of the Western air defense systems, there is a real significant training challenge. But you know, we're looking at this for all the systems we provide to Ukraine. We make sure that we have the capability. We have the training to go with it. And we have the maintenance and sustainment capability to go with it so that you know when we make this commitment, they know it's a commitment to a full system.\n\nVOA: You mentioned armored vehicles, and the U.S. has provided the Russian armored vehicles. But to date, I haven't seen any M1A1 Abrams being provided to Ukraine, which some people would say could significantly give them an advantage on the battlefield. Is that something that the United States would send? And that's another question - why hasn't the United States sent an American-made M1A1 Abrams to this fight yet?\n\nCooper: So again, we're looking at what they need right now and what they can use right now. And so, we have provided a number of armored vehicles of a variety, everything from armored Humvees to 113s, and these are APCs that have enabled the Ukrainians in their counteroffensive operations to maneuver in a protected way. So that is something that we have prioritized, and they have successfully used. For tanks, we've prioritized helping refurbish or incentivize donations of Soviet-type tanks because we've seen the Ukrainians use these very, very effectively. We know they can be deployed immediately and the maintenance and sustainment of them is relatively straightforward. And Ukrainians are very capable of doing it. Something like a Western-style tank would take a much longer time period, not just to train on but a much more complex and challenging maintenance and sustainment system, not something that could happen in the immediate future.\n\nVOA: And then I finally want to talk about the potential threats coming out of Russia. Ukraine is in many ways, for the West, a battle for democracy, a battle for sovereignty, not allowing somebody to come in and bully another sovereign nation. But the looming threat is the nuclear threat. However, we're 10 months in now, and there has been talk, irresponsible talk the Pentagon has said, but no action, where do you see Russia standing on the nuclear threat? Do you think that that is still a very real threat? Or are you on the side where a lot of analysts are, that say they have no tactical advantage on the battlefield? And so, at this point, they do not think Russia would use nuclear weapons.\n\nCooper: So, I will tell you, this is something we watch every day, literally every single day. We are paying attention to the Russian nuclear enterprise. And looking to see if there are any signs that they are mobilizing or moving forward with any kind of heightened state of readiness or ultimately strike. We see no signs that Russia is doing anything unusual with their nuclear enterprise. But we keep monitoring that. In terms of Russian intentions. It's hard. It's hard to see inside [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's mind, certainly, but what we have seen out of Moscow on nuclear issues is really a lot of irresponsible saber-rattling designed to intimidate but not linked to any specific actions.\n\nVOA: There will be a new Congress. Do you foresee the aid that the U.S. is providing Ukraine to change at all? And should the Ukrainians be expecting a new aid package soon?\n\nCooper: So, I have had the pleasure of being on the receiving end of incredible congressional bipartisan support for Ukraine. And it really has been a partnership with the U.S. Congress. I foresee continued very strong support from the U.S. Congress. Of course, it's a dialogue. It's a process where we hold ourselves accountable to the U.S. Congress for the assistance that they are appropriating, but I foresee strong support. And everything that I hear from members of Congress is that they want the Ukrainians to have the capabilities they need when they need it. So, we're unified in that.\n\nVOA: So, can you tell Ukrainians watching VOA, that this administration will remain committed to them for as long as it takes and for as long as they need to remain in this war?\n\nCooper: I have heard it from every U.S. leader, whether it's [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin or President [Joe] Biden himself. We will support Ukraine for as long as it takes.",

All provide a comprehensive level of protection against different threats.\n\nPatriots are another step on that same path - and one which will antagonise Moscow.\n\nThey're not a silver bullet, but they are extremely capable, effective and expensive. One Patriot missile costs around $3m - three times the cost of a missile in a NASAMS (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System). Two NASAM systems have been in operation in Ukraine for several weeks.\n\nThe new Patriot missile battery \"will be a critical asset to defend the Ukrainian people against Russia's barbaric attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure\", the White House said in a briefing.\n\nPatriots were used against Iraq's Russian-made Scud missiles during the first Gulf War and have been continuously developed since by Raytheon Technologies. They come in batteries that include a command centre, a radar station to detect incoming threats - and launchers.\n\nRanges to target reportedly vary between 40km to 160km (100 miles), depending on the type of missile used. And they are what's termed \"point defence\" systems: generally designed to defend particular areas such as cities or important infrastructures - in other words high-value assets.\n\nThe US announcement refers to a single unit comprising a radar station, control system and, of course, the missile launchers.\n\nIt is likely to be placed around a high value asset or key city for additional protection. We will not know where, as once Western systems are in Ukrainian hands they effectively become Ukrainian property, under the command of the country's military.\n\nNo US or other Nato troops can operate these systems inside Ukraine, so like other Western weapons Ukrainian forces will have to be trained to use them - and that training will take place outside of their country. Such training could already be well under way and, more broadly, the US military has said it will expand its training for Ukrainian forces in Germany from January.\n\nMoscow has called any plans to deploy Patriots \"a provocation\" and a further expansion of the United States' military involvement in Ukraine. Russia indicated that such missiles would become what it called \"legitimate targets\" for missile strikes, something that has been said before in this war.\n\nThe decision to send a battery is a clear statement that Washington remains committed to doing what is required for Ukraine to try to protect itself. Iran's involvement in supplying Russia with attack drones and perhaps other weapons increases the concern. The net effect is more advanced Western systems into Ukraine, something Moscow did not want to happen.\n\nPrecisely what overall effect Patriot systems will have is difficult to say.\n\nThey will certainly provide an additional layer of protection, but their size and expense means that few units will be able to be sent.",

The civil infrastructure of the settlements of Respublikanets, Tyaginka, Zelenivka, Inzhenerne, Antonivka, Sadove, and Veletenske of the Kherson region and the city of Kherson were damaged. The enemy continues to suffer losses. For example, in the city of Starobilsk, Luhansk region, in the military hospital equipped by the occupiers, about 50 seriously wounded enemy servicemen have recently been delivered. In the city of Horlivka, Donetsk region, due to the lack of donor blood, all employees of medical institutions were obliged to donate blood according to the established schedule. {The damage to the invaders manpower and equipment in the previous days has been confirmed. So, in the Donetsk oblast, 4 self-propelled artillery systems 2C7 \"Pion\" were destroyed. And in the Zabaryne district of the Kherson oblast, the headquarters of the occupiers was hit, where a meeting of officers of the southern military district of the armed forces of the russian federation was held.

It is reported that the jet is out of commission and will not be able to fly in the near future.\n\nOn 25 December, an air-raid siren blared throughout Ukraine two times in the course of the day. At the same time, an Il-76 A-50U long-range radar tracking plane Sergey Atayants, as well as a fighter aircraft and a MiG-31K of the Russian Air Force, which can carry Kinzhal missiles, [took off from] Machulishchy, Belarus.\"\n\nArmed Forces of Ukraine strike Russian HQ in Kherson where officer meeting was held, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"On 24 December, the Armed Forces of Ukraine hit the Russian headquarters in the area of Zabaryne, Kherson Oblast, where an officers meeting was held; up to 70 invaders were wounded.\"\n\nBlasts heard at Russias Engels air base, Ukrinform reports. \"Explosions have been heard at a strategic military air base in Engels, Russia. Thats according to Russian Telegram channels, Ukrinform reports.\n\nEngels airfield, a siren can be heard. Before that, there were explosions (two explosions according to initial information), the report said. Russia uses the airfield for massive missile attacks on Ukraine. Russian Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers are stationed there.\"\n\nThree killed from falling drone wreckage at Russian military base in Saratov Defence Ministry, Reuters reports. \"Three military personnel were killed as a result of wreckage from a Ukrainian drone falling on a military base in Russias Saratov region, Russian agencies reported citing the countrys defence ministry.\n\nOn December 26, at about 01:35 Moscow time, a Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down at low altitude while approaching the Engels military airfield in the Saratov region,\" the Russian Defence Ministry [claimed]. The ministry added that aviation equipment was not damaged.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ukraine_map/status/1607397133946159105\n\nBelarus says Russia-deployed Iskander missile systems ready for use, Reuters reports. \"The Iskander tactical missile systems and the S-400 air defence systems that Russia has deployed to Belarus are fully prepared to perform their intended tasks, a senior Belarusian defence ministry official said on Sunday. []\n\nIt is not clear how many of the Iskander systems which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons have been deployed to Belarus after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in June that Moscow would supply Minsk with them and the air defence systems.\"\n\nAccording to British Defence Intelligence, (last 24 hours):\n\nRussian forces have largely focused on constructing defensive positions along many sections of the front line in Ukraine since October. This includes laying additional fields of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, almost certainly going beyond Russian doctrinal guidelines.\n\nalong many sections of the front line in Ukraine since October. This includes laying additional fields of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, almost certainly going beyond Russian doctrinal guidelines. Minefields only present an effective obstacle for trained troops if covered by observation and fire. A major challenge for the Russian forces will likely be a shortage of surveillance assets and trained personnel to effectively monitor large areas of the new minefields.\n\nLosses of the Russian army\n\nAs of Monday 26 December, the approximate losses of weapons and military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces from the beginning of the invasion to the present day:\n\nPersonnel about 102600 (+550),\n\nTanks 3016 (+5),\n\nArmored combat vehicles 6017 (+7),\n\nArtillery systems 1996 (+5),\n\nMultiple rocket launchers MLRS 418 (+0),\n\nAir defence means 212 (+0),\n\nAircraft 283 (+0),\n\nHelicopters 267 (+0),\n\nAutomotive technology and fuel tanks 4647 (+12),\n\nVessels/boats 16 (+0),\n\nUAV operational and tactical level 1707 (+1),\n\nSpecial equipment 178 (+0),\n\nMobile SRBM system 4 (+0),\n\nCruise missiles 653 (+0)\n\nRussian enemy suffered the greatest losses (of the last day) in the Kupiansk, Avdiivka, and Bakhmut directions.\n\nRussians lost thousands of soldiers at Bakhmut, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Serhii Haidai, Head of Luhansk Oblast Military Administration. \"As for Bakhmut, it is no longer even a strategic military plan, although there is such a thing, but a rather symbolic matter, which the Kremlin regime loves very much.\n\nPlus, the Kadyrovites [the Chechen forces led by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and fighting as part of the Russian army -ed.] and Wagnerites [and inmates recruited by Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the founder of the Wagner Group private military company -ed.] want to prove themselves and show the bunker grandpa[Putin] that they are capable of something. But so far, they are losing thousands of their soldiers, who stay there for life.\"\n\nPutin still tells tales of 99.9% of Russians \"ready to put everything on the line for Motherland\", Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the vast majority of Russians are ready to \"put everything on the line\" for the sake of their country.\n\nIt simply reassures me once again that Russia is a special country. And special people live here. According to him, this is allegedly confirmed throughout the entire history of Russias existence, and once again today.\"\n\nDuma prepares higher taxation for Russians who left country (which is ironic in view of Putins claim above), Reuters reports. \"Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Duma, said the Russian lower house of parliament was preparing a law to introduce higher taxation for people who have left the country, as many have since the war in Ukraine began in February. It is right to cancel preferences for those who have left the Russian Federation and to introduce an increased tax rate for them, Volodin wrote on the Telegram messaging app. We are working on appropriate changes to the legislation.\n\nThe number of Russians who have left since the start of the war is unclear. By early October, some local media had reported that as many as 700,000 had fled following the September announcement of a mobilisation drive to call up as many as 300,000 to fight. The government rejected that figure at the time.\"\n\nHumanitarian\n\nRussians hold people at Vasylivka checkpoint, Zaporizhzhia Oblast for ten days, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing Ivan Fedorov, Mayor of Melitopol. \"The Ruscists made a reservation out of the occupied territories and are holding people hostage. For the last 10 days, the Russians have not released residents of the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts leaving towards the city of Zaporizhzhia through Vasylivka checkpoint.\n\nAccording to the mayor, over the course of 10 months, the occupiers intensified terror and made evacuation difficult; they artificially created thousands of queues at checkpoints and introduced a system of special travel passes, for which it was necessary to wait up to a month at the occupation commandants office.\n\nA month ago, the invaders stopped releasing men fit for military service, and now they are not releasing even children, women, and the elderly. For people who want to drive through, the invaders offer to leave their cars and go to Zaporizhzhia on foot. The occupiers note that the road is closed until January 15.\"\n\nMore than 15M tonnes of grain exported from Ukrainian ports Turkish defense minister, Ukrinform reports. \"Thanks to the work of the Joint Coordination Center established in Istanbul, more than 15 million tonnes of food were safely sent from Ukrainian ports to countries in need. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said this during a trip to Gaziantep province, Ukrinform reports, citing DHA.\n\nOn November 17 in Istanbul, Ukraine, the United Nations and Trkiye agreed to extend the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian ports (the Black Sea Grain Initiative) for another 120 days. The initiative was launched on July 22, and the first vessel with Ukrainian grain left the port of Odesa on August 1.\"\n\nLegal\n\nRussian Army destroys church in Kherson Oblast, Euromaidan Press reports. \"Attacks of Russian troops which target religious buildings in Ukraine violate international laws, Ukraines Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Christmas Day on 25 December.\n\nThe only Kyselivka village (Kherson Oblast) church was fully destroyed by Russian shelling. The Hague Convention IV protects religious buildings during hostilities, but for Russian war criminals there is no God, nor any respect for religion, the minister wrote on Twitter.\"\n\nTwo hospitals hit in Russias deadly attack on Kherson, Ukrinform reports, citing by Kherson Regional Military Administration Head, Yaroslav Yanushevych. \"Two hospitals were hit in Russias deadly attack on the city of Kherson yesterday. Fortunately, no casualties were reported.\n\nRashists continue to attack hospitals in the Kherson region. These are deliberate terrorist attacks on the facilities providing aid to civilians. Yesterday, the enemy struck two health facilities in Kherson, Yanushevych wrote.\"\n\n450 children were killed, 867 children injured the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reports as of period 16-23 December. 3,126 educational establishments are damaged as a result of shelling and bombings, 337 of them are destroyed fully. 56,330 crimes of aggression and war crimes, and 18,404 crimes against national security were registered.\n\nSupport\n\nBolting random weapons on random chassis, the Ukrainian army proves its ingenuity and desperation, Forbes reported on 19 December. \"A slightly odd-looking Ukrainian infantry fighting vehicle, churning through the cold mud thats typical of Ukraines early winters, tells a profound story. One of desperation. And improvisation. The Ukrainian military and its supporting industry for months have been taking bits and pieces of wrecked armored vehicles and combining them with museum-quality antique weapons and even pickup trucks. The result is a dizzying array of improvised armour, rocket-launchers and air-defense systems. Each the military equivalent of Frankensteins monster.\n\nSome obviously work just fine. Some probably dont. All are indicative of Ukrainian ingenuity. But they also underscore vexing shortages in the Ukrainian arsenalshortages that Ukraines foreign allies are unwilling or unable to fill as Russias wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 10th month. []\n\nDespite the shortfall, Ukraines NATO allies have donated just a few hundred IFVsall of them BMPs. Ukraine hasnt received a single non-Soviet IFV from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or any other ally.\n\nInstead, NATO countries have sent to Ukraine a thousand lightly-armed APCsM-113s, mostlythat each can carry a squad of infantry but generally lack turrets and cannons. They can carry, but they cant fight. Yes, the M-113 is fast and reliable. But all those APCs filling in for IFVs could represent risk for Ukrainian heavy brigadesand likely explain the enduring demand for Frankenstein fighting vehicles.\n\nIts safe to assume that, if the Ukrainians were getting hundreds of second-hand M-2s from the Americans or Marders from the Germans, they wouldnt bother welding BMP turrets to PRP-3/4 hulls. But those M-2s and Marders arent forthcomingand its difficult to explain why. Many NATO armies are in the process of replacing their older IFVs with new designs or, owing to post-Cold War force-structure cuts, are sitting on huge reserves of idle IFVs.\n\nNATO countries seem to be answering a logistical impulse. They want to equip the Ukrainian army with the fewest possible different vehicles. By that rationale, its better for the United States and Germany both to offer up M-113s than for the Americans and Germans separately to pledge M-2s and Marders. One supply chain versus two.\n\nBut in the case of armored vehicles, that logistical standardization comes at the cost of combat capability. Ask Ukrainian commanders which trade-off they favor. They might not always ask for simpler logistics. If simplicity were their priority, they wouldnt be bolting random rockets and guns onto whatever wheeled or tracked chassis they can get their hands on.\"\n\nThe military balance 10 months into the full-scale war, reported by Volodymyr Dacenko, analyst and a columnist in Forbes Ukraine. This is a comparison of the available military power of Ukraine and Russia (according to open-source data). Although the mobilization did not go well in Russia, the Russians managed to saturate the front line and complicate the advance of the Armed Forces. The new mobilized who arrive at the front are already better prepared than the first batches. They are, however, equally poorly equipped\n\nIn general, the gap between Ukraine and Russia in military power is gradually decreasing. This is a consequence of disparity in battlefield losses, Russian defense industries limited ability to replace equipment lost due to sanctions, and not least, because of Western-supplied defense aid to Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, Ukraine has received a high number of war trophies. Russia is the main supplier of heavy weapons to Ukraine (at least tanks and armored vehicles).\n\nWhile Russias \"generosity\" is welcome, Ukraine needs more modern weapons. Most heavy weapons received from Western partners (and Russia) are Soviet legacy systems. The parity in technology helps turn the war into a war of attrition rather than modern, manoeuvre warfare. Russia cannot be defeated by numbers, but by quality. Ukraine needs a technological advantage to succeed. Introducing the American M-60 and M-1 Abrams or the German Leopard-1 and Leopard-2 would give Ukraine an advantage on the battlefield.\n\nRussia has been forced to change its tactics several times. Initially, Russia attempted a \"Blitzkrieg\" using heavy armoured vehicles. This summer, they abandoned their traditional Battalion Tactical Group concept and began using groups of armoured vehicles and infantry for attacks. Now, the assault is mainly carried out by infantry units supported by artillery (as in World War I).\n\nUkraine, on the contrary, uses more armoured vehicles during its counter-offensive. It is, however, lacking both armoured vehicles and main battle tanks in the numbers needed to breakthrough and rout Russian forces.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, recently stated that Ukraine needs 300 tanks, approximately 700 infantry fighting vehicles, and 500 howitzers to be able to achieve the next major objective.\n\nArtillery is becoming a problem for Russia. Considering the tens of millions of old Soviet shells, Russia will not run out of artillery ammunition anytime soon. According to Volodymyr Dacenko, they are, however, running out of ammunition for the attack at a distance of more than 20 km.\n\nPresently, Ukraine is probably dominating at range between 20-80 km, while Russia dominates ranges below and beyond. Ukrainian supplies of 155mm shells and GMLRS are, however, limited. It needs longer-range capabilities to destroy the Russians logistics nodes in the rear. The destruction of Russian logistics is one of the main premises for both preserving lives and military capabilities as well as conducting counteroffensive.\n\nUkraines Foreign Minister convinced that its only matter of time till Ukraine receives all necessary weapons, Ukrainska Pravda reports. \"Ukraines Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is convinced that Ukraine will eventually receive all the weapons it needs from its partners. This is my impression. If we sum up all the behind-the-scenes conversations, not just in Washington, D.C., but also in other countries, the conclusion is this: all the necessary weapons will be made available, its only a matter of time.\n\nWhy cannot the weapons be provided immediately? There are psychological, logistical, and political reasons. But we have to work with all these barriers, and we will. It is not just a matter of reluctance.\n\nThe supply of any weapon is a very complex technical and logistics operation, we are dealing with all of these details jointly with colleagues from other government agencies I have a definite feeling, a finger-tips feeling so to say, that the matter of weapons supply has no taboos. And the best testament to that are the Patriots [air-defence systems].\"\n\nSupport for Ukraines energy sector from international partners reached almost $1.5B, Ukrinform reports, citing Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \"Assistance to the energy sector from partners is gaining momentum. We have almost $1.5 billion in declared support. Additional equipment is arriving every day to repair damaged infrastructure. More than 200 cargoes of energy equipment have already arrived, the report said.\n\nShmyhal recalled that the state would allocate UAH 150 million to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs for investment projects in the field of energy saving and energy supply. Also, last week the Government of Ukraine allocated UAH 400 million to businesses as part of the eRobota project.\"\n\nNew developments\n\nUkraine will create its own Christmas miracle, Zelenskyy says in defiant message, Reuters reports. \"Ukrainians will create their own miracle this Christmas by showing they remain unbowed despite Russian attacks that have plunged millions into darkness, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a defiant message on Saturday. Speaking 10 months to the day since Russian launched a war that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions more, Zelenskyy said that while freedom came at a high price, slavery would cost even more.\" Putin boasts that situation with war in Ukraine \"not as dangerous\" for Russia, Ukrainska Pravda reports, citing RIA Novosti and RBC. \"Putins response when asked whether Russia is approaching a dangerous point in the war against Ukraine: \"Well, I dont think its that dangerous.\" The Russian president alleged once again that, by attacking Ukraine, he was acting the right way, defending the national interests, the interests of citizens and people, and that there was simply no other choice. [] At the same time, [] alleged that he was ready to negotiate on acceptable terms with all the participants in this process, but this is a matter for Ukraine and the West to consider.\" Putin says Russia ready to negotiate over Ukraine, Kyiv says Moscow doesnt want talks, Reuters reports. \"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved about acceptable solutions, but that is up to them we are not the ones refusing to negotiate, they are, Putin told Rossiya 1 state television. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin needed to return to reality and acknowledge it was Russia which did not want talks. \"Russia single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens,\" the adviser, Mykhailo Podoliak, tweeted. Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility.\" Russia to supply Iran with 24 Su-35 aircraft i24NEWS, Euromaidan Press reports. \"Russia will soon supply Iran with a full squadron of advanced Sukhoy Su-35 multirole fighter jets, the Israeli-based news television channel i24NEWS reported referring to unnamed Western intelligence sources who monitor security deals between Iran and Russia. It will apparently be 24 Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets, originally produced for Egypt under a deal that was torpedoed by the United States. The Russians were looking for buyers for the unsold surplus, and it looks like Tehran will be getting those planes very soon. According to an intelligence report, Iranian pilots are already training on these planes, i24NEWS says.\"\n\nAssessment\n\nOn the War\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has made the following assessment as of Saturday 24 December:\n\nUkrainian Counteroffensives Eastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast) Russian forces continued to conduct limited counterattacks to regain lost positions along the Kreminna-Svatove line on December 24. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian assault near Andriivka, Luhansk Oblast (15km west of Svatove). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Stelmakhivka (16km northwest of Svatove) and in the direction of Nadiia (16km west of Svatove). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces have transitioned from offensive operations to positional battles near Dvorichna (55km northwest of Svatove). Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces conducted assaults in the direction of Makiivka (23km northwest of Kreminna) and in the area of Chervonopopivka (6km north of Kreminna) and that there are positional battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of Ploshchanka (17km northwest of Kreminna). One Russian milblogger claimed on December 23 that Russian forces are now at a distance close enough to Makiivka to effectively use small-arms fire against Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian sources reported that Russian forces also conducted assaults in the direction of Yampolivka, Donetsk Oblast (17km west of Kreminna) and near Bilohorivka (12km south of Kreminna). A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted an assault in the vicinity of Dibrova (5km southwest of Kreminna). Ukrainian forces continued to strike Russian rear areas on December 24. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces struck Polovynkyne, Luhansk Oblast (56km southeast of Svatove) with HIMARS rockets. Social media sources posted footage indicating that Ukrainian forces reportedly struck an unspecified warehouse in Polovynkyne. Russian forces rate of advance in the Bakhmut area has likely slowed in recent days, although it is too early to assess whether the Russian offensive to capture Bakhmut has culminated. Russian milbloggers acknowledged that Ukrainian forces in the Bakhmut area have managed to slightly slow down the pace of the Russian advance around Bakhmut and its surrounding settlements, with one claiming that Ukrainian forces pushed back elements of the Wagner Group to positions they held days ago. Ukrainian social media sources previously claimed that Ukrainian forces completely pushed Russian forces out of the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut around December 21. ISW has also assessed that Russian forces made slightly fewer overall advances in the Bakhmut area in November and December combined as compared to the month of October. Russian forces will likely struggle to maintain the pace of their offensive operations in the Bakhmut area and may seek to initiate a tactical or operational pause. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UK MoD) reported on December 24 that Russian forces currently lack the necessary stockpile of artillery munitions to support large-scale offensive operations and that sustaining defensive operations along the lengthy frontline in Ukraine requires the Russian military to expend a significant number of shells and rockets daily. The Ukrainian Joint Forces Task Force released an interview on December 24 with a Ukrainian servicemember in the Bakhmut area detailing that Russian forces have been conducting an extremely high pace of assaults on Ukrainian positions in the area with little corresponding progress. The Wagner Groups reported heavy losses in the Bakhmut area in recent weeks have also likely strained Russian forces current operational capabilities in the area. The Russian militarys personnel and munitions constraints will likely prevent it from maintaining the current high pace of offensive operations in the Bakhmut area in the near-term. Russian forces previously allocated significant resources in a meat-grinder effort to seize Severodonesk and Lysychansk in springsummer 2022. Russian forces culminated after capturing Lysychansk in early July and failed to capture neighboring Siversk to the east or Sloviansk to the northeast. The Russian militarys fixation with conducting a highly attritional campaign to achieve the tactical objectives of capturing Severdonetsk and Lysychansk ultimately undermined the Russian militarys ability to achieve its larger operational objective to envelop Ukrainian forces in a cauldron along the E40 highway and eventually drive to Donetsk Oblasts western administrative borders. Russias relentless and costly push on Bakhmut may also degrade Russias ability to pursue long-term objectives in the Donbas theater. Russian siloviki may be setting information conditions to justify the nationalization of oligarchs resources to sponsor Russias war effort. Wagner financier Yeveniy Prigozhin attended the funeral of a deceased Wagner Group mercenary in St. Petersburg on December 24, where he stated that Russia needs to confiscate luxury possessions and accommodations from elites who ignore or do not support the war effort out of fear of losing their privileged lifestyles. Prigozhin added that these affluent individuals support a vision where \"Western curators\" dominate Russia in return for the sponsorship of their lifestyles and compared todays Russian oligarchy to Ukraines or to 1990s Russia. Prigozhin ignited a scandal regarding the burial of the Wagner serviceman in recent weeks to push his political objectives such as the legalization of Wagner in Russia and his statements advocating redistribution of wealth at the funeral gained significant traction on the Russian internet. Wagner-affiliated milbloggers widely supported Prigozhins criticism of Russian officials and praised his support for the war effort. Prigozhin may be using such populist proposals to elevate his authority in Russian society or influence a return of stricter nationalization measures. Russian President Vladimir Putin also indirectly attacked Russian oligarchs on December 22, however, stating that Russians who drain Russias money from abroad and do not have a connection with the country \"represent a danger\" to Russia. Putin claimed that while the vast majority of Russian businessmen are patriots, there are some who do not share the sentiment. Putin concluded that \"everyone strives not only to stay, to live and work in Russia but to work for the benefit of our country.\" Putin previously nationalized big businesses in the early 2000s to consolidate his authoritarian kleptocracy and may be attempting leverage nationalization to coerce elites to support his war in Ukraine or seize their property to fund military expenses. Ukrainian intelligence continues to suggest that the Russian military is not following proper command structures or procedures. Chief of the Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Kyrylo Budanov stated that Prigozhin formed an alliance with the Commander of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, Army General Sergey Surovikin. Budanov noted that both Prigozhin and Surovikin are rivals of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, and that Prigozhin used the alliance to his advantage to receive heavy weapons from Russian Armed Forces for Wagner forces. The allocation of military resources should in principle rest with the Minister of Defense rather than the theater commander, although Surovikin could have the authority to make transfers once equipment enters the theater. The PrigozhinSurovikin alliance is plausible given that Prigozhin had previously praised Surovikin for his efforts to save the collapsing Soviet Union.

The sanctions bite hard dare I say that. The war costs a lot of money. And Putin has already lost. He was mistaken about the resistance of the Ukrainians. Thats because no one dares tell him the whole truth anymore, including about the state of his army, which was cannibalized by corrupt officers.\n\nBut Hitler had already lost the war at the end of 1943, and it lasted another two years. Putin can cause a lot of mess for a very long time. Hence the bombing of the energy infrastructure, with the aim of plunging people into such misery that millions come to Europe. He uses energy and migration as a weapon against us, because he knows that we are vulnerable on those two points and can be played apart, in the hope that the political forces in which he has invested for years will gain more political power in the member states, he said, speaking to Nieuwsblad.\n\nMr. Timmermans also told what is needed to defeat Russia: as Putin invaded Ukraine after the EUs weak reaction to the occupation of Crimea the only way to go is to keep strong and support Ukraine:\n\nThe only thing that will lead to a change of course in Moscow is the realization that the West is not giving up no matter what it is doing on the ground. Once Putin and Lavrov start to think that there are cracks in the front, they can hold on even longer. We must keep ranks closed, form a front with the Americans and continue to support Ukraine financially and militarily. And if more refugees arrive, we have to receive them properly again. So far I dont see any cracks. Even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban now joins financial support for Ukraine.\"\n\nUkrainian forces used Russian soldiers panicked cell phone calls to pinpoint their locations and pick them off, report says, Insider reports. \"Russian soldiers in Ukraine made worried calls home as their efforts in Ukraine faltered but their loved ones werent the only ones listening. Ukrainian forces used the cell phone calls made by Russian soldiers to locate them and wipe the troops out in large numbers, according to an investigation published by The New York Times that details Russias blunders throughout the war.\n\nWe listened to the Russian soldiers as they panicked and called their friends and relatives, a Ukrainian official who leads the efforts to intercept the phone calls told The Times. They used ordinary phones to make decisions about their further moves.\n\nUkrainian authorities who monitor cell networks for criminal activity noticed that a large number of calls were being placed from foreign phone numbers in an area along the Ukraine and Belarus border. The officials deduced the unusual uptick in foreign numbers on the Ukrainian network were likely Russian soldiers.\n\nUkraine deployed teams of women to follow the soldiers calls and alert the Ukrainian military, which would carry out attacks using the information. We understood where the enemy was, what numbers they were using, the Ukrainian official told The Times. At one point, Ukrainian forces used both the cell phone calls and a TikTok video to locate a unit of Chechen soldiers outside of Kyiv. Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraines military intelligence, told The Times the units location was confirmed only 40 minutes after the video was uploaded. Ukrainian forces then struck them with three missiles.\n\nUkrainian officials have frequently intercepted phone calls made by Russian soldiers since the invasion 10 months ago. Audio of the calls obtained by various outlets have captured Russian soldiers complaining about being unprepared and unorganized and hoping they would get injured so they could be sent home. In new audio published by The Times, soldiers could be heard complaining about Russian President Vladimir Putin and saying they are being treated like cannon fodder.\"\n\nPutin may use Iranian missiles and drones to destroy Patriot system media, Ukrinform reports, citing Forbes. \"Putin may ultimately use Iranian-supplied weaponry and Iranian tactics in any attempt he makes to eliminate Ukraines Patriot. Specifically, he might try and replicate a combat-tested strategy used by the Houthis against the Saudi-led coalition during the Yemen war, the article says.\n\nIt adds that that strategy saw the Houthis use their Qasef-1 loitering munitions, a variant of the Iranian Ababil-2, against the coalitions Patriots. The munitions were programmed with open-source GPS coordinates of the Patriot positions, which they used to target their radars. Once they neutralized those radars, the Houthis would fire SRBMs, many of them also based on Iranian designs, without worrying about the Patriots successfully intercepting them.\n\nIf the Ukrainian Patriot is fixed in place in Kyiv, which is very likely, Russia may launch an unprecedented number of Shaheds in swarm attacks directed against its radar and bombard the area with SRBMs to ensure the destruction of that battery. By doing so, Moscow would signal that its attacks are unstoppable despite the efforts of the US and its allies to build up and enhance Ukraines air defenses, Forbes said.\n\nAt the same time, the media outlet draws attention to the fact that Washington has never suggested that supplying the Patriot will constitute a so-called game-changer in this war. The delivery is much more symbolic of continued American resolve to support Ukraine. However, its destruction could likewise prove symbolic for Putin, who may conclude that launching a major operation to destroy it would be a worthy endeavor purely for the propaganda value, the article reads.\"\n\nConsequences and what to do?\n\nTrying to find ways to improve outcomes and reduce Ukraines dependence on high rates of artillery fire, by Michael Kofman, Director, Russia Studies at CNA. \"The US is trying to find ways to improve outcomes and reduce Ukraines dependence on high rates of arty fire. Less attrition, more manoeuvre.\n\nTraining to do combined arms at company/battalion level is good in and of itself, but it wont necessarily solve this problem. I have no doubt Ukraine can learn combined arms manoeuvre and saw elements of this at Kharkiv. However, without the US Air Force air superiority, US logistics, C4ISR, etc its a bit hard to fight like Americans. How well would we do without airpower?\n\nMore importantly, it misses the fact that attrition is what enabled manoeuvre in Ukraine offensives. Against a well-prepared defence, with sufficient density of forces, it wasnt nearly as successful, and casualties were high. This is why Kherson was so difficult compared to Kharkiv/Lyman. Ukraine way of war depends on fires, exploited by manoeuvre. It is a successor military to the Soviet military, which was artillery centric, and in that respect is much closer to the Russian military than our own.\n\nYou have to work with what has proven successful for your partners. Deep strike, precision, better ISR, can help improve Ukraine performance. My bias is that Im wary of seeing a solution that implies trying to turn that military more into us. That said, theres no easy answer here. The US is not optimized to support a protracted artillery-driven war in Europe. Folks can also judge for themselves, looking at the history how good we are at converting other militaries to fighting more like Americans.\n\nHans Petter Midttuns assessment\n\nIn recent months, several articles have painted a picture of President Putin as ill-advised, increasingly paranoid, and surrounded by pro-war hawks.\n\nThe Times article \"Inside Putins bunker: how he kept the plan to invade Ukraine secret\" argued that President Putting \"remained in lockdown\" after Moscow officially emerged from lockdown on June 9, 2020. He would continue to be extremely cautious to the point of paranoia about the virus two years later. As a result, Putins personal contact which for years had been limited to a small group of no more than three dozen insiders, shrunk even further.\n\nIn the seclusion and inaccessibility of his Covid bunker, surrounded by ideologues and sycophants, Putin developed a deep belief that Russian domination over Ukraine must be restored, according to former Kommersant newspaper political editor Mikhail Zygar.\n\nOr as the CIAs Burns would put it in April 2022, Putins risk appetite has grown as his grip on Russia has tightened. His circle of advisers has narrowed and in that small circle, it has never been career-enhancing to question his judgment or his almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russias sphere of influence.\n\nOver two years in isolation, Putin developed a longstanding enthusiasm for historical theorising, which would culminate in an essay on Russia and Ukraine published in July 2021. The essay, according to one senior state TV executive, was entirely [Putins] own work the result of much research and deep thought\".\n\nNot only had the group of insiders shrunk but the \"most deluded and the most ideologically driven members of Putins entourage were on the inside, while those with the most detailed real-world knowledge were on the outside.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article \"Putin, Isolated and Distrustful, Leans on Handful of Hard-Line Advisers\" portrayed Putin in a similar manner. US officials have described his closest allies as even more hard-line than the authoritarian leader himself. He found himself \"isolated and distrustful at the pinnacle of a power structure designed to reinforce his belligerent worldview and shelter him from discouraging news\".\n\nPutins \"circle of advisers narrowed and in that small circle, it has never been career-enhancing to question his judgment or his almost mystical belief that his destiny is to restore Russias influence.\n\nIt is claimed that Putin became increasingly paranoid as the circle tightened.\n\n\"The president increasingly speaks of Russia in near-religious terms, as a 1,000-year-old civilization waging a holy struggle that will right historical wrongs and elevate him into a pantheon of conquering czarist leaders such as Peter the Great.\"\n\nHis situational awareness has been questioned since the very start of the full-scale invasion. According to the WSJ article, Putin has long refused to use the internet for fear of digital surveillance, making him extremely reliant on briefing documents compiled by ideologically aligned advisers. Battlefield updates can take several days to reach him, leaving them often out of date. While he has attempted to improve his access to information, including reaching out to the pro-war milbloggers, he \"remains surrounded by an administration that caters to his conviction that Russia will succeed, despite the mounting human and economic sacrifices.\"\n\nAttempts to present him with a more balanced assessment of the real situation are allegedly stopped by his staff.\n\nThe two articles paint a highly worrisome picture of a president without a flawed grasp of reality, a distorted perception of Russian history and historical rights, surrounded and advised by a small group of ideologically driven pro-war hawks. He is sometimes described as paranoid, a quality that probably comes with the job description of most autocracies.\n\nI find the description of the flawed command structure, the limited flow of information, the lack of trust, balanced information, critical thinking, and situational awareness, extremely important. That is without a doubt, a critical Russian vulnerability that will help speed up its demise.\n\nThe concerns about President Putins state of mind, however, do not come across as convincing.\n\nAcknowledging that psychology is a highly dynamic field and that a personality might change over time, the articles had one common weakness: Their starting point is (more or less) aligned with the start of the full-scale war.\n\nThey leave out the events leading up to the war in 2014, including President Putins strategic narratives. His messaging has remained near constant since 2007. His Ukraine obsession has been a part of his strategic thinking since his infamous Munich Security Conference speech.\n\nThe Russian full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022 was by no means a starting point but a \"logical\" consequence of 15 years of violations of international law and an increasingly more aggressive Russian Foreign Policy.\n\nIts violations of international law until 24 February include its attack on Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, war crimes in Syria, attempted coup in Montenegro, the downing of MH-17, closure of the Kerch Strait, blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov and the attack on its navy, restrictions on international freedom of navigation, terrorist attacks and not least, its hybrid war against both Ukraine as well as the NATO and EU member states. The latter includes repeated interference in elections and referendums, energy war, information war, cyber-attacks, liquidations, political manipulation, and more.\n\nThe invasion was not a result of a rash decision, but a carefully, calculated process resulting from years of actively undermining Ukraine and testing Western resolve. The Russian misinterpretation of the West is first of all an indication of failed NATO and EU diplomacy and their failure to respond resolutely to 15 years of Russian provocations. The ultimatum served to the USA and NATO on 17 December, while being utterly unrealistic, served as a climax of years of Russian diplomacy, demands and threats.\n\nIts failure to read Ukraine correctly, however, is probably more complex. Its a reflection of Russias perception of Ukraine as a \"little brother\", otherwise described as arrogance. It is probably also a consequence of both its own disinformation and wishful thinking, resulting from the notion of \"historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians\". Putins essay on the subject from July 2021 only summarised views he had conveyed for years already.\n\n\"I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia. Our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries and have their origins in the same sources, they have been hardened by common trials, achievements and victories. Our kinship has been transmitted from generation to generation. It is in the hearts and the memory of people living in modern Russia and Ukraine, in the blood ties that unite millions of our families. Together we have always been and will be many times stronger and more successful. For we are one people.\"\n\nUnderestimating Ukrainian resolve and resistance was also a result of the previously described failings: a flawed Russian command structure, staff reinforcing Putins own thinking, a limited flow of information, a lack of trust, balanced information, critical thinking, and situational awareness. But there is probably also a darker and more ominous element to it. What happened in Kherson the oblast that on paper should have been the easiest to defend but where the gate was left open might have also served as a clue to their expectations as to what would happen in other sectors.\n\nReviewing the last 15 years the invasion is nothing, but a continuation of a policy set in motion years ago. Even the inner circle consists of people who have been a part of the continuity.\n\nWhen it happened, it was not a sign of an unstable or unhinged president. It was the sign of a predetermined, strategic leader who had patiently built the military capability needed, undermined his victim and tested his opponent and still got it wrong for failing to build a leadership culture allowing for critical thinking, falling victim to his own distorted information and history and not least, failing to understand the extent systematic corruption and theft had destroyed Russia from within.\n\nAggressive? Frustrated? Disappointed? Very much so. Sane? Most likely. Stupid? Not at all. Fcked? Big time.",

                "cc_text": "by Jennifer Shutt, Louisiana Illuminator\n\nDecember 22, 2022\n\nWASHINGTON The U.S. Senate passed a massive $1.7 trillion funding package Thursday that carries emergency aid for natural disaster recovery and the Ukrainian war effort, pushing past disputes over immigration policy and barely meeting a Friday deadline when current funding runs out.\n\nThe bill, supported by both Democrats and Republicans, now goes to the U.S. House, which could act yet Thursday. The overwhelming majority of Republicans there are expected to vote against sending the measure to President Joe Biden after unsuccessfully trying to hold over negotiations until next year when theyll control that chamber. Biden has said he would sign the omnibus bill.\n\nThe package, approved on a 68-29 Senate vote just hours after an address to Congress by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, includes $45 billion in new military and humanitarian aid to assist Ukrainians in their fight against Russias invasion. That brings the U.S. investment in the war to more than $111 billion. Sixty votes were needed for passage.\n\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky holds an American flag gifted to him by U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi as he addresses a joint meeting of Congress in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 21, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nIt would also make notable changes, negotiated by lawmakers, in the state-federal Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The package would allow states to begin removing some millions of residents from Medicaid as soon as April and would phase out the bump in federal funding states got during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep people on the health care program.\n\nThe measure was the last Senate vote of the current Congress; lawmakers will reconvene in January.\n\nMissouri Sen. Roy Blunt, Arkansas Sens. John Boozman and Tom Cotton, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, South Dakota Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune and Indiana Sen. Todd Young were among the 18 Senate Republicans who voted for passage.\n\nPregnant workers, Title 42\n\nBefore approving the bill, senators voted to reject seven amendments and adopt eight during a four-hour vote series. The modifications to the package included provisions dealing with standards for pregnant workers; state use of COVID-19 funding; and protections for nursing mothers. Senators rejected amendments dealing with Title 42, a controversial public health policy used to turn away migrants at the border.\n\nAmong the votes:\n\nHouse and Senate GOP split\n\nSenators voted 73-24 to adopt an amendment fromthat added the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to the package. Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr., a primary sponsor of the bill, said the amendment would set a standard for \"reasonable accommodations\" to ensure \"that if a woman is pregnant in the workforce, she can do her job and have a healthy and safe pregnancy.\" Cassidy argued the measure would do \"what we want for ourselves, our wives, our sisters and our daughters.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also backed its inclusion, saying \"the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is one of the most significant improvements to workplace protections in years. Tens of millions will be covered under this legislation, especially millions who work low-income jobs, long hours and get little support.\" The measure is extremely close to a version of the bill approved by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, though lawmakers strengthened \"protections for religious employers,\" according to Cassidys office. The Senate adopted by voice vote an amendment from Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn and California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla that would give local, state and tribal governments more flexibility in how they use unspent COVID-19 funding from the federal government. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, had their amendment adopted by voice vote. It would allow the U.S. Justice Department through the Secretary of State to transfer proceeds seized from Russian oligarchs under sanctions or other Russian entities under sanctions to Ukraine. The Senate, 92-5, adopted an amendment from Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski that added the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections for Nursing Mothers Act to the package. Merkley said the amendment broadens a bill Congress passed in 2010 to allow nursing mothers time and space to pump breast milk while at work. Murkowski said the provision is \"good for babies, its good for new mothers, its good for employers to get these women back into the workforce.\" HELP Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement the measure would \"help close loopholes that leave nearly nine million working moms uncovered by federal protections to ensure they have reasonable break time and a private place to pump.\" The Senate rejected an amendment from Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester that would have addressed Title 42. The pandemic-era policy, originally put in place during the Trump administration, allows the border patrol to turn away migrants under the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions public health authorities. Title 42 was set to expire Wednesday, but the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in an ongoing court case, temporarily keeping the program in place until the justices can take further action. \"This amendment keeps Title 42 until a permanent plan is in place, boosts desperately needed border funding for security, invests in our agents and officers, and stops the flow of dangerous drugs,\" Sinema said. Tester said the provision would have approved additional funding \"for judges and legal officials to ensure orderly processing\" as well as providing resources for law enforcement at the Southern border and overriding the Biden administrations decision to sunset Title 42. The 10-87 vote on the Sinema-Tester amendment, which would have provided $8.7 billion, fell short of meeting the 60-vote threshold set for adoption. The Senate rejected a separate Title 42 amendment from Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee that would have extended Title 42 by preventing the federal government from spending any money to end the designation. The vote was 47-50. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin spoke against Lees amendment, saying \"this is not about public health anymore. It is our excuse for not tackling the very real challenge and coming up with a border policy on a bipartisan basis.\"\n\nThe decision by House Republican leaders to sit out the bipartisan negotiations on the funding package and whip against the bill marked a stark contrast with Senate GOP leaders, who helped shape the legislation and voted for the measure.\n\nSenate Minority Leader McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday morning that the bill is \"imperfect but strong\" and lauded a large boost in defense spending.\n\n\"Senators have two options this week: We will either give our armed forces the resources and certainty that they need, or we will deny it to them,\" McConnell said.\n\nIn this file photo from September 2017, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) listen to questions from reporters during a news conference following their weekly policy luncheon in Washington, DC. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nHe noted that a failure to pass the omnibus would lead Congress to instead have to pass additional stopgap spending bills that would give the \"military real-dollar funding cuts because of inflation, and give Defense Department leaders no certainty to plan and invest.\"\n\nMcConnell also backed the investment in Ukraine, saying its \"morally right.\"\n\n\"But its not only that. Its also a direct investment in cold, hard American interests,\" McConnell added.\n\nSchumer hailed the domestic spending increases in the legislation during a Wednesday morning floor speech, noting it would boost federal child care assistance funds by 30% and make permanent a program that allows kids to access school meals during the summer months.\n\nThe package would also allow states to keep providing one year of postpartum health care coverage for patients within Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, a change Schumer said is \"a great breakthrough.\"\n\n\"Discrimination in maternal care and at birth is a real blot on our country, and the fact that people of color have higher rates of mortality is a disgrace,\" Schumer said. \"This goes a good way toward trying to rectify that blot on our countrys pride.\"\n\nThe sweeping $1.7 trillion spending package would fund the departments and agencies that make up the federal government, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, public lands and the Pentagon, through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.\n\nNegotiators released the 4,155-page omnibus government funding bill early Tuesday morning, following months of back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans about how much in additional money to provide during the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe bill includes $40 billion to help communities recover from natural disasters, including $5 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agencys disaster relief fund, $3.7 billion for crop and livestock losses and $75 million for Interior Department wildland fire suppression activities.\n\nThe package carries along with it several bills that lawmakers have been negotiating for months, including legislation that would update the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to clarify the vice presidents role as ceremonial and increase the threshold for objecting to a states electors from one member from each chamber to one-fifth of each chamber.\n\nThe measure would ban federal employees from having the social media app TikTok on work phones.\n\nLawmakers wrapped in a bill that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to have oversight of cosmetics for the first time.\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. DONATE\n\nMedicaid plans, Afghan resettlement\n\nThe shifts in Medicaid come after 25 GOP governors wrote to Biden earlier this week, calling for an end to the COVID-19 public health emergency in April and arguing the designation is \"negatively affecting states\" by increasing the number of residents on Medicaid.\n\n\"This is costing states hundreds of millions of dollars,\" the governors wrote in the letter.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the pandemic,\" they wrote, \"states have added 20 million individuals to the Medicaid rolls (an increase of 30%) and those numbers continue to climb as the PHE continues to be extended every 90 days.\"\n\nDemocrats have emphasized other changes in the omnibus that will benefit children.\n\n\"Im ecstatic that Medicaid and CHIP will now offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children to ensure that the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year,\" said House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, in a statement.\n\n\"Thanks to this provision, and the additional two years of funding secured in this agreement for CHIP, our kids will no longer be subject to fluctuations in coverage that endangers their health and well-being.\n\n\"The omnibus also makes the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage permanent, which I hope all states will adopt to ensure new moms have access to health care in the critical first year after delivery.\"\n\nOn other issues affecting families, the omnibus government funding package doesnt include the expansion of the child tax credit that Congress approved during the pandemic, but had since lapsed amid disagreement about how it should be structured.\n\nThe measure also doesnt include the Afghan Adjustment Act, a bipartisan bill that would have helped provide a pathway to permanent legal residency for certain Afghan evacuees.\n\nSchumer said Tuesday that GOP leaders prevented the bill from going into the catchall spending package.\n\n\"It was a very high priority. It had some good Republican support, but unfortunately the Republican leadership blocked it,\" Schumer said. \"These are people who risked their lives for our soldiers and for our country.\"\n\nMcConnell said the bill was left out, in part, because of the time crunch to negotiate the government funding measure in the last days of the 117th Congress.\n\n\"It is an important issue, but there were many things that one could argue were important that didnt make it into the bill,\" McConnell said. \"That ought to be addressed. I think its important.\"\n\nSeveral former ambassadors to Afghanistan wrote a letter to Congress, as did three former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several other retired military officers, urging lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nWithout the Afghan Adjustment Act, the former ambassadors wrote, \"tens of thousands of recently arrived Afghans will have to find an existing immigration pathway to remain lawful once their parole expires.\"\n\n\"That will mean tens of thousands of new asylum claims, when the current affirmative asylum backlog is more than 400,000 cases with a broader immigration backlog of 1.4 million cases.\"",

If you have a question for the candidates, submit it here .\n\n(NewsNation) The U.S. is expected to announce Wednesday that it will send a major package of $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine that will for the first time include a Patriot missile battery and precision-guided bombs for its fighter jets, the White House said.\n\nThe aid signals an expansion by the U.S. in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to Ukraine to bolster its air defenses against what has been an increasing barrage of Russian missiles in recent weeks. The package will include about $1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stocks and $800 million in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, officials said.\n\nIts something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought for months to augment his countrys air defenses.\n\nThe decision to send the Patriot battery came despite statements from Russias Foreign Ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface-to-air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the Patriot battery and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for Moscows military.\n\nIts unclear when the Patriot battery would arrive on the front lines in Ukraine, since U.S. troops will have to train Ukrainian forces on how to use the high-tech system. The training could take several weeks and is expected to be done in Germany. To date, all training of Ukraines forces by the U.S. and its Western allies has taken place in European countries.\n\nBut experts caution that the systems effectiveness is limited, and it may not be a game changer in the war.\n\nWhat is the patriot?\n\nThe Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles.\n\nEach Patriot battery consists of a truck-mounted launching system with eight launchers that can hold up to four missile interceptors each, a ground radar, a control station and a generator. The Army said it currently has 16 Patriot battalions. A 2018 International Institute for Strategic Studies report found those battalions operate 50 batteries, which have more than 1,200 missile interceptors.\n\nThe U.S. batteries are regularly deployed around the world. In addition, Patriots also are operated or being purchased by the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland and Bahrain.\n\nThe Patriot system \"is one of the most widely operated and reliable and proven air missile defense systems out there,\" and the theater ballistic missile defense capability could help defend Ukraine against Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles, said Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nPatriot Cost\n\nOver the years, the Patriot system and missiles have been continually modified. The current interceptor missile for the Patriot system costs approximately $4 million per round and the launchers cost about $10 million each, CSIS reported in its July missile defense report. At that price, its not cost-effective or optimal to use the Patriot to shoot down the far smaller and dramatically cheaper Iranian drones that Russia has been buying and using in Ukraine.\n\n\"Firing a million-dollar missile at a $50,000 drone is a losing proposition,\" said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps reserves colonel and senior adviser at CSIS.\n\nDeployment concerns\n\nA Patriot battery can need as many as 90 troops to operate and maintain it, and for months the U.S. was reluctant to provide the complex system because sending forces into Ukraine to operate it is a non-starter for the Biden administration.\n\nBut there were also concerns that deployment of the system would provoke Russia, or risk that a missile fired could end up hitting inside Russia, which could further escalate the conflict.\n\nAccording to officials, the urgent pleadings of Ukrainian leaders and the devastating destruction of the countrys civilian infrastructure, including loss of electricity and heat as winter drags on, ultimately overcame U.S. reservations about supplying the Patriots.\n\nA key hurdle will be training. U.S. troops will have to train Ukrainian forces on how to use and maintain the system. Army soldiers assigned to Patriot battalions get extensive training to be able to effectively locate a target, lock on with radar and fire.\n\nThe U.S. has trained Ukrainian troops on other complex weapons systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS. In many cases theyve been able to shorten the training, getting Ukrainian troops out to the battlefront in weeks. Officials have declined to provide details on how long the Patriots training would take and where exactly it will be done.\n\nPatriot capabilities\n\nUkraine faces a range of Russian threats, and the Patriot is good against some and not that useful against others.\n\nOne former senior military official with knowledge of the Patriot system said it will be effective against short-range ballistic missiles and it represents a strong message of U.S. support, but one battery isnt going to change the course of the war.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Ukraine deal has not yet been made public, noted that one Patriot battery has a long firing range, but can cover only a limited broad area. As an example, Patriots can effectively protect a small military base, but cant fully protect a large city such as Kyiv. They could only provide coverage for a segment of a city.\n\nPatriots are often deployed as a battalion, which includes four batteries. This wont be the case with Ukraine, which officials said would be receiving one battery.\n\nThe Patriot has a more powerful radar that is better at discriminating targets than the Soviet-era S-300 system the Ukrainians have been using, but it has limitations, both Karako and Cancian said.\n\nStill, the Patriots ability to target some ballistic missiles and aircraft could potentially protect Kyiv if Russian President Vladimir Putin carried through on his persistent threat to deploy a tactical nuclear device. But that would depend on how the weapon was delivered, Karako said. If it was a gravity bomb delivered by a warplane, the system could target the aircraft; if it was a cruise or short- to medium-range ballistic missile, it could also possibly intercept the missile, Karako said.\n\nRaytheon, which manufactures the Patriot, says it has been involved in 150 intercepts of ballistic missiles since 2015. The success rate of the Patriot, however, has been repeatedly questioned. A 1992 Government Accountability Office report said it could not find evidence to support reports that the system had achieved a 70% success rate against Scud missiles in the Gulf War. In 2018, Saudi Arabias success in using Patriots against missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen was questioned when videos surfaced of systems failing.\n\nBut beyond the Patriots capabilities, its deployment is a big statement of support for Ukraine.\n\n\"Theres a lot of symbolism here,\" Cancian said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                "cc_text": "When Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he was expecting a quick and decisive victory that would cement his place in Russian history and reverse the verdict of 1991 by extinguishing Ukrainian independence once and for all. Instead, the year draws to a close with his army demoralized by successive defeats and Russias reputation as a military superpower in tatters.\n\nIn the first days of the invasion, it soon became clear that things were not going according to plan. Far from greeting Russian troops as liberators, the Ukrainian nation rose up in defiance. Kremlin intelligence forecasts predicting the rapid collapse of the Ukrainian military also proved wildly inaccurate. On the contrary, Ukrainian forces fought back with unexpected skill and ferocity, leading to catastrophic Russian losses.\n\nBy the end of March, Russia had conceded defeat in the Battle of Kyiv and withdrawn entirely from northern Ukraine. Putin responded to this setback by regrouping his decimated forces in eastern Ukraine and concentrating on completing the occupation of the Donbas region. Despite initial success due to Russias overwhelming artillery advantage, this offensive had largely stalled by midsummer with the initiative passing to Ukraine.\n\nThe second half of 2022 was marked by a series of spectacular Ukrainian victories. Russian troops were routed in the Kharkiv region and forced to retreat from the strategically important southern city of Kherson, the only Ukrainian regional capital to be occupied by Russia. The withdrawal from Kherson was a personal humiliation for Putin. Just weeks earlier, he had hosted a lavish annexation ceremony in the Kremlin and proclaimed that Kherson had joined Russia \"forever.\"\n\nUnable to make progress on the battlefield, Putin changed tack in October and ordered the methodical destruction of Ukraines civilian infrastructure. Waves of airstrikes featuring missiles and kamikaze drones have since plunged Ukraine into darkness while depriving millions of Ukrainians of heating, water, and electricity. This bombing campaign is causing great hardship but does not appear to be undermining Ukraines fighting spirit.\n\nWhile the Russian dictators dreams of an historic victory have failed to materialize, he is not yet ready to admit defeat. In September, Putin announced his countrys first mobilization since World War II, allowing him add a further 300,000 men to his depleted invasion force. Additional waves of mobilization are possible in the coming months. On the home front, the Russian economy is being prepared for the rigors of a long war. Nor is there any sign of significant domestic unrest. Polls indicate that most Russians continue to support the invasion, while those who do not have largely remained silent or chosen exile over protest.\n\nThere is currently no end in sight to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin officials insist Moscow will achieve its objectives, while Western leaders are equally adamant that Russia must not be allowed to succeed. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Ukrainians see the war as a fight for national survival against an openly genocidal enemy. This leaves little room for negotiations or a compromise peace.\n\nWith fighting set to continue into 2023, the Atlantic Council invited a range of experts to share their observations of the war so far. Why has Putins Ukraine invasion gone so disastrously wrong?\n\nDaniel Fried, Weiser Family Distinguished Fellow, Atlantic Council: What went wrong? Lots of little things but two big things in particular: Russias failure to understand Ukraine and its failure to understand its own system. The Kremlin seems to have believed its own propaganda that the Ukrainian nation does not exist except in subordination to Russia. In this view, a Ukrainian nation that insists it has separate identity and national existence is merely a fascist deformity that must be destroyed by fire and sword. Those familiar with Russian and Soviet imperial thinking can discern the antecedents: Nineteenth century Russian reactionary nationalism and its Soviet counterpart that attempted to identify any Ukrainian patriotism exclusively with its right-wing expression during WWII.\n\nThe Kremlin seems not to grasp how deep Ukrainian patriotism runs and how it has taken shape in a more liberal, multi-ethnic, and pro-democratic form, partly in revulsion against Putinism and its malign values. This spirit of patriotism, personified but not created by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has so far enabled the Ukrainian military to maintain its morale and helped Ukrainian society stand firm in the face of terror and deprivation.\n\nIn contrast, Putins corrupt system fueled by theft and deceit has hollowed out the Russian military and left Russian society generally cynical. Russian state television features bloodthirsty commentators while thousands of Russian young men flee the country to avoid military service. The sacrifices Ukrainians are willing to make as they fight for their lives and their country seem foreign to Putins Russia. Like the Czarist regime in the early twentieth century, Putin seems to have believed a \"short victorious war\" was just the tonic his system needed. But Russias failure in the 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War merely exposed the rot at the heart of the empire.\n\nTyrannies often turn out to be weaker than the image put forth by their strutting leaders. Democracies often turn out to be resilient in ways that can astonish those who look no further than their messy politics or peacetime pettiness. So it seems with Russia and Ukraine, with the battle still in the balance.\n\nSuriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: With Russian atrocities continuing, it is still far too soon to declare that Putin has failed in his effort to make Ukraine sorry for not wanting to be Russian. At the same time, its certainly clear that he is not winning. This failure to win is rooted in Putins own lack of understanding that Ukrainians are not Russians. Obviously, this is most immediately evident in Ukraines willingness to fight in order to avoid being forcibly subsumed into Russia.\n\nOn a deeper level, Ukrainians have demonstrated emphatically that they differ from their Russian neighbors in terms of the national character they have displayed during the past ten months of war. The innovation, work ethic, and commitment to country over self shown by Ukrainians are all qualities that, if they previously existed in Russia, Putin himself has worked hard to erode.\n\nSince February, Putin has found Ukraine a very a different opponent compared to the country he expected to face. Ukraines aptitude for teamwork and ability to rapidly change tactics are factors that he simply has no answer for. And it is these same Ukrainian qualities that will ensure the country eventually rebuilds and rebounds.\n\nSteve Pifer, William J. Perry Fellow, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University: Several reasons help explain why Russias invasion of Ukraine has gone so badly. First, the Kremlin and Russian General Staff greatly underestimated their foe and did not expect the Ukrainians to resist with such tenacity, skill, and courage. It is astonishing that they so badly misunderstood their neighbor. It was clear to Western observers that Ukrainians would fiercely resist, as they see this as an existential fight.\n\nSecond, the Russian military has not mastered certain complex tactics such as combined arms operations and suppression of enemy air defenses. For example, armored columns entered urban areas unsupported by dismounted infantry, while Russian air power stays largely over Russian-controlled territory for fear of being shot down by Ukrainian air defense. This adds to other problems endemic in Russias military such as poor leadership, poor morale, and poor logistics.\n\nThird, the Kremlin has discovered that the defense sector is not immune from the corruption that pervades Russian society. Moscow is not getting the results it expected from the hundreds of billions of US dollars spent on modernizing the Russian military over the past 15 years. For example, the Russian military received precision-guided weapons that often miss targets or otherwise fail, while some tanks have explosive reactive armor plates filled with rubber rather than explosives.\n\nFourth, Though not moving as rapidly as they could and should, Western arms deliveries have given the Ukrainian army additional military tools to sustain its fight.\n\nStay updated\n\nAs the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\n\nKristina Hook, Assistant Professor, Kennesaw State University: Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine will be studied as one of the eras biggest political, military, economic, and moral failures. Years of corruption and bad governance weakened Russias military and institutional capabilities. The personal nature of Putins authoritarianism encouraged pilfering over policy planning and selective law enforcement over meritocracy, while creating neo-imperial blind spots that prevented key members of the Putin regime from understanding the historic nature of the changes taking place in neighboring Ukraine.\n\nMany Russians simply underestimated the talent and tenacity of Ukrainians, who used the last eight years of armed conflict in the east of the country to carry out crucial military reforms and develop civil society. Ugly stereotypes about Ukraine continue to undermine Russias ability to accept and learn from their military defeats at the hands of the Ukrainian army.\n\nWhile credit for stalling Russias war machine belongs primarily to Ukraines defenders, citizens, and state, Putin also badly underestimated the Wests commitment to a rules-based global order. Despite Russian nuclear saber-rattling and erroneous assumptions of the democratic worlds readiness to abandon Ukraine, West military aid has continued to expand and diversify.\n\nLooking ahead, the genocidal nature of Russias war implies that we must prepare for Putin to double down on his failures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has recently painted a sobering but realistic view of the military support still needed in order to protect civilians and prevent Russia from achieving its goals. Now is the time to continue demonstrating how ill-advised Putins miscalculations are.\n\nJames Sherr, Senior Fellow, International Centre for Defence and Security, Tallinn: In Russia, the absolute imperative of absolute victory is never deflected by anything so trivial as error. Between February and May, those who believed that the Russian military system had insulated itself from the venality, mendacity, and servility of the Putin system found themselves pleasantly or rudely surprised. But we see once again that just as Putin is on the point of losing one game, he starts another. The withdrawal of strike groupings from Kyiv was the prelude to the Donbas offensive, then to mobilization and reinforcement, and now to the crippling of Ukraines energy infrastructure, which has become indistinguishable from the wholesale destruction of the country. The latter enterprises are abetted by the appointment of the mercilessly competent Russian General Sergei Surovikin and Irans de facto entry into the war.\n\nIt is time we understood that as long as Putin remains in power, the war will continue. If, as is now possible, Russia forces a halt to Ukraines offensive momentum, this need not be long in duration nor disadvantageous to Ukraine. Russias military commanders are capable of learning lessons and are learning them; but the military system has limited capacity to absorb these lessons. In contrast, Ukraines capacity for adaptation, innovation, and renewal are unmatched and indestructible. Ukraines Western partners must draw a lesson of their own. Time favors Ukraine. But it must be used to deny Russia the sanctuaries it requires to shape the parameters and rules of this conflict.\n\nDiane Francis, Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council: Putins invasion has failed so far because of several miscalculations. Crucially, he believed his own propaganda about Russias unassailable military might. He was also convinced that Ukraine was not a nation but a mere province of Russia. He believed NATO would remain ineffective. And he never dreamed that US President Joe Biden would help unite Europe and launch massive sanctions along with an unprecedented program to arm and support Ukraines defense.\n\nPutins first military mistake was to launch an unprovoked invasion with just 150,000 troops compared to the 600,000 soldiers sent in 1968 to crush anti-Soviet protests in Czechoslovakia, a country one-fifth the size of Ukraine. He also misunderstood the cultural shift in Ukraine toward the West and underestimated the leadership and communication skills of Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has harnessed the intelligence, resilience, patriotism, and unity of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nTen months into Russias invasion, Ukraine has gained the initiative thanks to a combination of battlefield courage and strategic skill along with massive Western help and favorable world opinion. Putin cannot reverse this. He has threatened a possible escalation to nuclear weapons but would do so at the peril of his nation. As he murders more civilians, bombs more infrastructure, and plunges Ukrainians into freezing darkness this winter, Putin is a reviled figure and is increasingly seen as a failure. Meanwhile, Ukraine is honored and celebrated across the globe.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, Ukrainian MP, Holos Party: The main reason Putin is failing is because he was too late. If he had struck in 2014 when the Ukrainian state was weak, the army was almost non-existent, institutions were unstable, and the opposition had much less influence on national affairs, his chances for success would have been much higher. However, Russia did not seize this opportunity and Ukraine was able to strengthen. The countrys strategic course toward the EU and NATO was enshrined in the Ukrainian Constitution, while the Ukrainian army underwent vital reforms that resulted in significantly increased quality.\n\nThe second reason behind Putins difficulties is the fact that the Russians did not expect to encounter broad civilian resistance in Ukraine. This reflects deeply entrenched Russian misconceptions about the nature of Ukrainian society, and is also due to the Kremlins massive financial investment prior to the invasion to weaken and corrupt Ukraine from within. However, all regions of Ukraine united to resist Russias invasion.\n\nA third key factor was the initial military assistance provided by partners such as the US, UK, Poland, and the Baltic states in the months immediately preceding the Russian invasion. These weapons deliveries helped Ukraine to keep fighting during the critical first weeks of the war and convinced the democratic world to begin sending more advanced and diverse arms supplies to the country.\n\nAlexander Motyl, Professor, Rutgers University: The Russian invasion has gone badly for several reasons. The Russians came awfully close to capturing Kyiv during the first weeks of the invasion but the Ukrainians fought hard and managed to stave off the immediate assault. Once that happened and the shock of the attack began to wear off, the Ukrainians rallied, while the Russians reverted to business as usual. That meant poor leadership, poor logistics, poor tactics, and poor strategy. These are all products of a modern Russian military system that squanders resources, ignores modernization, and promotes corruption.\n\nAbove all, the Russian performance has been undermined by Vladimir Putins constant interference in military affairs. Inevitably, his inexperience and arrogance have resulted in a series of poor decisions. The internal rot within the Russian armed forces thereby came to the fore and has been amply demonstrated throughout the war.\n\nWestern support has also been crucial. Once a Russian victory no longer seemed inevitable, once the Ukrainians proved they would fight and could survive, and once the Ukrainian military demonstrated that it knew how to fight effectively, the West overcame its initial skepticism and began to supply Ukraine with significant amounts of weapons and other resources.\n\nUltimately, of course, the underlying cause of Putins failing invasion is Russias chronic underestimation of Ukraine and Ukrainians. This is a cultural predisposition that manifests itself in the view that Ukrainians are incompetent and inferior, and are thus incapable of any kind of successful military campaign.\n\nMiriam Kosmehl, Senior Expert Eastern Europe and EU Neighborhood, Bertelsmann Stiftung: Vladimir Putin simply did not understand the strength of Ukrainian national identity or the durability of the state the Ukrainians had built. Due to his own fear of domestic uprisings against his rule, Putin has created a strong personal power vertical but not a strong Russian state. He made the mistake of assuming Ukraine was the same.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Putin badly underestimated Ukraine. When preparing to invade, he failed to recognize Ukraines deep-rooted commitment to the countrys independence and democratic future. Russia observed President Zelenskyys falling approval ratings along with the constant flow of criticism from Ukrainian civil society and drew the false conclusion that most Ukrainians would welcome change. This was a fundamental misreading of the situation.\n\nFor years prior to the invasion, the Russian security services had been preparing the ground by penetrating Ukrainian local government structures and recruiting Ukrainian officials to switch sides at the decisive moment and aid a Russian takeover. However, with the survival of the Ukrainian nation at stake, the vast majority of Ukrainians fought back. Russia completely misjudged this readiness of individual Ukrainians to fight for their country. When the full-scale Russian invasion began, huge numbers of Ukrainians flocked to join the army or territorial defense forces. Similarly, Moscow expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be a weak wartime leader. In hindsight, this may have been the biggest miscalculation of all!\n\nPutins disastrous failure to understand the realities of todays Ukraine was accompanied by similarly unrealistic expectations regarding the Wests likely response to a Russian invasion. Based on the muted Western reaction to earlier Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Putin believed he could count on a similarly underwhelming response. Instead, the West imposed tough sanctions and began unprecedented arms shipments to Ukraine.\n\nPeter Dickinson is Editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert Service.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Centers mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

                "cc_text": "East Room\n\n4:44 P.M. EST\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Please, be seated. Thank you.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy, Im honored to welcome you back to the White House.\n\nWeve spent an awful lot of time on the telephone as well as on video, but its good to see you in person again. And weve been in close and frequent communication throughout this conflict from the very beginning, but particularly its particularly meaningful to talk with one another in person look each other in the eye, because leadership through this terrible crisis has inspired the Ukrainian people as you have done, Mr. President and the American people and the entire world.\n\nThis visit to Washington, your first trip outside Ukraine since February, comes as President Putin is escalating his attacks his brutal attacks targeting critical infrastructure to make life as hard as possible for not only innocent Ukrainians but children and young children, and everything from orphanages to schools. Its just outrageous what hes doing.\n\nAs weve as weve heard into and as we head into the new year, its important for the American people and for the world to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraines fight and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.\n\nThis visit also falls on the 300-day mark of Russias brutal invasion of Ukraine. Three hundred days since Putin launched an unprovoked, unjustified, all-out assault on the free people of Ukraine. Three hundred days of Ukrainian people showing Russia and the world their steel backbone, their love of country, and their unbreakable determination and I emphasize \"unbreakable determination\" to choose their own path.\n\nTo Ukrainian people, I say to them all: You have demonstrated you have shown your strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats who wrongfully believed you might you might they might be able to make might right, and theyre not able to do it.\n\nThus far, they have not theyve stood alone. You know, and youve had but you havent stood alone. You have had significant, significant help. Weve never stand alone you will never stand alone.\n\nWhen Ukraines freedom was threatened, the American people like generations of Americans before us did not hesitate.\n\nThe support from all across this country, Americans of every walk of life Democrats and Republicans alike had the resources and the to rebound in resounding, united way to do provide unequivocal and unbending support for Ukraine.\n\nBecause we understand in our bones that Ukraines fight is part of something much bigger. The American people know that if we stand by in the face of such blatant attacks on liberty and democracy and the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the world would surely face worse consequences.\n\nAnd as I said when Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine in February: American American people are prepared to have us stand up to bullies, stand up for freedom. Thats who we are as Americans. And thats exactly what weve done.\n\nEven before the invasion began and Putin threatened Ukraine by building up his forces, we helped make sure Ukraine would be prepared to defend itself even before they crossed into Ukraine.\n\nWe provided a steady stream of defensive weapons, including air defense systems and artillery, ammunition, and so much more. And weve not done it alone.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the United States rallied allies and partners from around the world to stand strong with Ukraine and impose unprecedented and I emphasize \"unprecedented\" sanctions and export controls on Russia, making it harder for the Kremlin to wage its brutal war.\n\nMore than 50 nations have committed nearly 2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles; more than 800 artillery systems; more 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition; and more than fif- more than 50 advanced multiple rocket launching systems; anti-ship and anti- and air defense systems all to strengthen Ukraine.\n\nTogether, weve provided billions of dollars in direct budgetary support to make sure the Ukrainian government can keep providing basic, fundamental services to the Uranian [Ukrainian] people like healthcare, education, and emergency personnel.\n\nThis includes another $2 billion that in direct budget support from the American people that the World Bank distributed earlier this week.\n\nWeve provided humanitarian assistance to help the millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes because of Putins inhumane and brutal war.\n\nCommunities across Europe have opened their hearts and their homes to help Ukrainians in need.\n\nThe United States has been proud to welcome more than 221,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge since March of 2022, including as part of Uniting for Ukraine as part of our Uniting for Ukraine program.\n\nAnd today, USAID is committing more than $374 million in urgently needed humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. This will help provide food and cash assistance for more than 1.5 million Ukrainian people, as well as access to healthcare, safe drinking water, and help stay warm in the winter to more than for more than 2.5 million Ukrainians.\n\nThe United States and our allies and partners around the world have delivered a broad range of assistance at historic speed, and its been critical to bolstering Ukraines success thus far.\n\nUkraine has won the battle of Kyiv, has won the battle of Kherson, has won the battle of Kharkiv. Ukraine has defied Russias expectations at every single turn.\n\nAnd, President Velenskyy [sic] Zelenskyy, you have made it clear he is open to pursuing a well, let me put it this way: Hes not open, but youre open to pursuing peace. Youre open to pursuing a just peace.\n\nWe also know that Putin has no intention no intention of stopping this cruel war. And the United States is committed to ensuring that the brave Ukrainian people can continue continue to defend their country against Russian aggression as long as it takes.\n\nAnd I want to thank the members of Congress and their for their broad bipartisan support to Ukraine. And I look forward to signing the omnibus omnibus bill soon, which includes $45 billion $45 billion in additional funding for Ukraine.\n\nI will also sign into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authori- authorities for to make it easier for the Department of Defense to procure critical munitions and defense materials for Ukraine and other key materials to strengthen our national security.\n\nToday, Im announcing the next tranche of our security assistance to Ukraine: $1.85 billion package of security assistance that includes both direct transfers of equipment to that Ukraine needs, as well as contracts to supply ammunition Ukraine will need in the months ahead for its artillery, its tanks, and its rocket launchers.\n\nCritically, in addition to these new capabilities like precision aerial munitions, the package will include a Patriot missile battery, which will and on which well train Ukrainian forces to operate as part of the ongoing effort to help bolster Ukraines air defense.\n\nIts going to take some time to complete the necessary training, but the Patriot battery will be another critical asset for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression.\n\nAltogether, todays new security assistance with humanitarian funding amounts to $2.2 billion in additional support for the Ukrainian people.\n\nWe should be clear about what Russia is doing. It is purposefully attacking Ukraines critical infrastructure, destroying the systems that provide heat and light to the Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another.\n\nIts the latest example of the outrageous atrocities that Russian forces are committing against innocent Ukrainian civilians children and their families.\n\nAnd the United States is working together with our allies and partners to provide critical equipment to help Ukraine make emergency repairs to their power transmission system and strengthen the stability of Ukraines grid in the face of Russias targeted attacks.\n\nWere also working to hold Russia accountable, including efforts in Congress that will make it easier to seek justice for Russias war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nLet me close with this: Tonight is the fourth nights of night of Hanukkah, a time when Jewish people around the world President Zelenskyy and many of the families among them honor the timeless miracle of a small band of warriors fighting for their values and their freedom against a much larger foe, and how they endured and how they overcame; how the flame of faith, with only enough oil for one day, burned brightly for eight days.\n\nA story of survival and resilience that reminds us that the coldest days of the year, that light will always prevail over darkness, and hope drives away despair; and that the human spirit is unconquerable as long as there are good people willing to do what is right.\n\nThis year has brought so much needless suffering and loss to the Ukrainian people. But I want you to know, President Zelenskyy I want you to know that all the people of Ukraine to know as well: The American people have been with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you. We will stay with you for as long as it takes.\n\nWhat youre doing, what you have achieved, it matters not just to Ukraine but to the entire world.\n\nAnd together, I have no doubt well keep the flame of liberty burning bright, and the light will remain and prevail over the darkness.\n\nThank you for being here, Mr. President. Were going to stand with you.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much. Thank you.\n\n(As interpreted.) Dear Mr. President please put on the equipment.\n\nOnce again, Mr. President, President Biden, audience, journalists, ladies and gentleman: I came here to the United States to forward the thank the word of thanks to the people of America, people who do so much for Ukraine. I am thankful for all of this.\n\nThis visit to the United States became, really, a historic one for our relations with the United States and the American leadership.\n\nIn the last 30 [300] days of this war, we have started a new phase of our inter-relations with the United States. We became real partners and allies with the content, and I felt today during all of my meetings and during our talks.\n\nOnce again, I would like to thank Mr. President, President Biden, for his candid support and what is very important the understanding of Ukraine and for the support of the international coalition to strengthen international law.\n\nI am grateful to President Biden for his personal efforts, his steps that unite the partners in Global South.\n\nWhen all countries of the world take some position and are focusing on cooperation and mutual understanding, this is very useful for all of the countries for Ukraine, for the United States.\n\nI want to thank the Congress for bipartisan, bicameral support. And I am looking forward to good meetings with the members of the Congress and their support. This is the visit that Im here today to meet with the Congress.\n\nThe main issue during todays talks is to strengthen Ukraine next year our movement forward to fight for our freedom and independence.\n\nI have good news returning home: President Biden announced a new package of defense support about 2 billion U.S. dollars. And the strongest element of this package is the Patriot battery systems, something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.\n\nThis is a very important step to create a secure airspace for Ukraine. And thats the only way we would be able to deprive the terrorist country and their terror attack to strike our energy sector, our people, and our infrastructure.\n\nWe had a very good negotiation and talks about our strategic steps which we discussed with President Biden and what we expect next year and for what we are preparing. This is very important for all Ukrainians, and I am hopeful.\n\nAnd once again, thank you, Mr. President, for $45 billion, because this is a big assistance, and I hope that the Congress will approve this financial assistance for our country. This is almost $45 billion. Thank you very much for the support. Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security.\n\nI know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope. And the United States will help us to defend our values and independence.\n\nAnd regardless of changes in the Congress, I believe that there will be bipartisan and bicameral support. And I know that everybody works for this.\n\nAnd, of course, during all of my meetings today, we discussed issues of a standoff against the terror of Russia, their destruction of our energy infrastructure. We need to survive this winter. We need to protect our people. And we need to be very specific in this area. This is a key humanitarian issue for us right now. This is the survival issue.\n\nWe are discussing sanctions and legal pressure on the terrorist country of Russia. Russia needs to be held accountable for everything it does against us, against our people, against Europe, and the whole free world.\n\nAnd it is very important that we have the peace formula. And for that, we offer very specific steps what America can do to help us to implement them.\n\nWe propose global formula for peace summit. Im thankful for our American counterparts, that they feel us and understand how important it is to continue and stay on course and work on integrity of the country and international rule of law.\n\nWe will also need as soon as our defense capabilities will be strengthened in the next few months. I dont want to discuss it in details right now. I believe you understand why. And I but I am very grateful to President Biden. Thank you for your attention to all of these issues.\n\nGlory to Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\nWere going to take questions from four different reporters. Im going to start with Alex of Yahoo News.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. In 2022, you presided over a bipartisan international coalition to support Ukraine. How will you keep that coalition from fraying in 2023?\n\nAnd, President Zelenskyy, welcome to Washington on this beautiful winter day. What is your message to the American people?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, in answering your question first, Im not at all worried about holding the alliance together in NATO and European Union, as well as other nations.\n\n(Translation audio is fed over English line.)\n\nI assume this is simultaneous?\n\nAll right. (Laughs.)\n\nQ Yes, it is.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Okay. Ive never seen NATO or the EU more united about anything at all. And I see no sign of there being any change.\n\nWe all know whats at stake here; our European partners all the more so. They fully understand it. This is about weve never seen a major invasion of a European country since World War Two. And they see no signs of it that Putin is going to do anything to change that unless we resist and we help the Ukrainians resist.\n\nWe all know whats at stake: the very idea of sovereignty, the U.N. Charter.\n\nPutin thought he would weaken NATO; instead, he strengthened NATO. I once said to him that if he talked about the he wanted wanted to see the, you know, Europe end up being divided. The and instead, what did he do? He produced a more united Europe, with Sweden and Finland joining.\n\nSo I dont see any reason to believe there will be any lessening of support. And as we reach out to our NATO Allies our Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State we get continued support. And not only there, but also from around the world from Japan and many other countries as well. So I feel very good about the solidarity of support for Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you for your question. Thank you very much. You asked me, \"What is the message to the American people?\" You know, I think I will tell you very simple things which are important for me. And I and I think so that we have the same values and the same understanding of the life, the sense of the life.\n\nMy message: I wish you peace. I think that is the main thing, and you understand it only when the war in your country, when somebody like these terrorists from Russia come to your houses. And I wish you to see your children alive and adult. And I wish you to see your children when they will go to universities, and to see their children. I I think that is the main thing what I can wish you.\n\nAnd, of course, to be together with us jointly, because we really fight for our common victory against this tyranny. That is real life. And we will win. And I really want win together.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNot \"want.\" Sorry. Im sure. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: You call on one of your people? A press person?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Yeah.\n\n(Speaks in Ukrainian. No translation provided.)\n\nQ Yeah, thank you. Dmytro Anopchenko, Ukrainian television. President Zelenskyy and President Biden, Ive got a question for both of you. But firstly, as a Ukrainian and I mean it I want to thank the United States for supporting my country. And, you know, my family is in Ukraine. And I definitely understand they would not be alive today if America will not support my country, both politically and militarily. So thank you for this. Its (inaudible).\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: We will.\n\nQ And as of my question: We entered a new phase of this war. And you definitely discussed today which path to choose, how the war could come to an end, and whats next will it turn into a new counter-offensive or some kind of peace talks.\n\nSo, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy, could you share your vision? Whats the fair way to end this war? And how do you understand this words for peace? Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: My my view?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Your guy. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: I think we have I see. I see.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Although, I like him very much already. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (As interpreted.) You have started this question you have started by stating that your family is in Kyiv. And without the assistance of the United States this is absolutely true the U.S. leadership in this assistance is strong. And, again, I would like to remind you that your family will be in danger without the armed forces of Ukraine, which are very important. That concerns your questions, per se.\n\nWhat would you like to hear? A just peace? I dont know. I dont know what \"just peace\" is. Its a very philosophical description. If there is a just war I dont know.\n\nYou know, for all of us, peace just peace is different. For me, as the President, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom, and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.\n\nIm sorry, Im reminding Im talking about children a lot today. But as a father, I would like to emphasize: You know how many parents lost their sons or daughters on the frontlines? So, what is just peace for them? Money is nothing. And no compensations or reparations are of no consequence. They live by revenge (inaudible). I think this is a tremendous tragedy.\n\nAnd the longer the war lasts, the longer this aggression lasts, there will be more parents who live for the sake of vengeance or revenge. And I know a lot of people like that.\n\nSo there cant be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these I dont know how to describe that because we are in the White House, and I cant find the proper language so these \"inhumans,\" I would say.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me respond. I think we have the we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous, and secure Ukraine is the vision.\n\nWe both want this war to end. We both want it to end. And as Ive said, it could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just said pulled out. But thats not going to happen. Not going to happen. Its not going to happen now.\n\nSo what comes next? What we talked about today was were going to continue to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield. It can succeed in the battlefield with our help, and the help of our European allies and others, so that if and when President Zelenskyy is ready to talk with the Russians, he will be able to succeed as well, because he will have won on the battlefield.\n\nAnd, you know, I I dont think we should underestimate the impact this war is having on Russia and the losses theyre suffering. And you saw just I think it was two days ago Putin saying that this is much tougher than he thought.\n\nHe thought he could break NATO. He thought he could break the West. He thought he could break the Alliance. He thought he could be welcomed by the Ukrainian people that were Russian-speaking. He was wrong, wrong, and wrong. He continues to be wrong. And the sooner he makes it its clear that he cannot possibly win this war, thats when the time we have to put the this President in a position to be able to decide how he wants the war to end.\n\nMy turn, huh?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Please, yes. Yeah.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Phil Mattingly of Mattingly of CNN.\n\nQ Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome, Mr. President.\n\nMr. President, to start with you: Your advisors often talk about how important how critically important you view face-to-face interaction. Im wondering, after spending two-plus hours face-to-face with President Zelenskyy, what you learned or what you took from the meeting that perhaps you couldnt glean or learn in the phone calls or video conferences.\n\nAnd somewhat tied to that, was there any discussion related to the U.S. assessments that Russia would not take escalatory action now that Patriots are being sent, will be del- a Patriot battery will be delivered?\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me answer the first question the first part of your question. You know, I get kidded for saying that theres all politics is personal. Its all about looking someone in the eye. And I mean it sincerely.\n\nI dont think theres any, any, any substitute for sitting down face-to-face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye. And thats exactly whats happening at this moment. Weve done that more than once, and were going to continue to do it.\n\nAnd the winter is setting in, and Putin is increasingly going after civilian targets and women and children, orphanages. This guy is well\n\nBut but hes going to fail. And hes going to fail. Hes already failed, because he now knows that theres no way hes ever going to occupy all of Ukraine. Theres no way in which hes going to be accepted by the Ukrainian people. And so, hes failed in the past. And it was very important for him and everyone else to see that President Zelenskyy and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed.\n\nAnd I think I may be mistaken, but I know I judge every leader by the way they what they say to me, their consistency, and looking me in the eye.\n\nThis guy (points to President Zelenskyy) has in his to his very soul is who he says he is. Its clear who he is. Hes willing to give his life for his country and all the folks who are with came with him today.\n\nAnd so I think its he its important for him to know we are going to do everything in our power everything in our power to see that he succeeds.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: What was the second part of your question?\n\nQ I just asked if you had discussed how the U.S. calculated the escalatory effect of sending a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I did not discuss that at all with with the President. But I we do not its a defensive system. Its a defensive weapon system. Its not escalatory. Its defensive. And its easy to not and wed love to not have to have them use it. Just stop the attacks.\n\nQ President Zelenskyy, again, welcome. You mentioned earlier that you wanted to make this trip for a while now. Why now?\n\nAnd also, can you tell me what you think the message you are sending to President Putin is, given the fact that 24 hours ago, you were on the ground, in the frontlines, with artillery echoing behind you, and now you find yourself in the White House standing next to the President?\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (As interpreted.) Thank you very much for your question. As to what is the message for Putin, I am standing here in the United States with President Biden on the same podium because I respect him as a person, as a President, as a human being for his position. And for me, this is a historic moment.\n\nI can send messages to President Biden. For example, if its not serious you said, \"Whats going to happen after Patriots are installed?\" After that, we will send another signal to President Biden that we would like to get more Patriots. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) Were working on it.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (Speaks English.) That is our life. We are in war. Im sorry. Im really sorry. (Laughter.) That is my appreciation.\n\n(As interpreted.) As to President Putin: In 2019, we had a Normandy meeting. In 2019, I became the President of Ukraine. And at that time, we were sending maximum messages to President Putin, telling him that there shouldnt be a full-scale invasion, to stop aggression, to renew our territorial integrity, to find diplomatic solution, or, God forbid, we should not have a full-scale war.\n\nAt that time, he said, \"It wont happen.\" He was lying. So what kind of message I can send him after he actually\n\ndestroyed our life, is destroying our life? He can even go further somewhere where the Soviet Union stayed before this, so he might want to invade those territories too.\n\nI believe that there is something mortal about his inadequate approach to the world. Why we need to send him a message? He needs to be interested in getting attention from the world, because he is not a subject of civilized people. He should be interested in trying to save something of his culture and history of his country. So thats his problem now.\n\n(Speaks Ukrainian.) (No translation provided.)\n\nAIDE: This will be the last question.\n\nQ Olga Koshelenko, 1+1 tv channel. When the full-scale invasion started, U.S. officials said that Ukraine cannot receive Patriots because, as you said, it might be unnecessary escalation. And now it is happening. Right now, today, it is happening. And now Ukraine desperately needs more capabilities, including long-range missiles ATACMS.\n\nMaybe I sound nave, but can we make long story short and give Ukraine all capabilities it needs and liberate all territories rather sooner than later? Thank you.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, th- his answer is yes. (Points to President Zelenskyy.) (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: (Laughs.) I agree. (Laughter.)\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me be straightforward with you here. Look, the fact is that its important to remember that before Russia invaded, we had dedicated an enormous amount of security assistance to Ukraine. And and weve given Ukraine what they needed when they needed to defend themselves. And since the invasion, that has resulted in more than $20 billion, in terms of security assistance.\n\nJust today, I approved another $1.8 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine for it to succeed on the battlefield. And were focused on working with allies and partners to generate capability in four key areas:\n\nAir defense. As kno- as we know today, the Patriot is the best of that.\n\nSecondly is to and were looking to do more. We provided hundreds of advanced artillery systems and dozens from dozens of countries.\n\nThirdly, weve worked with partners to get Ukraine tanks and other armored vehicles.\n\nAnd fourthly, weve announced today another 200,000 rounds of additional ammunition.\n\nNow, you say, \"Why dont we just give Ukraine everything there is to give?\" Well, for two reasons. One, theres an entire Alliance that is critical to stay with Ukraine. And the idea that we would give Ukraine material that is fundamentally different than is already going there would have a prospect of breaking up NATO and breaking up the European Union and the rest of the world.\n\nWere going to give Ukraine what it needs to be able to defend itself, to be able to succeed, and succeed in the battlefield.\n\nAnd the other piece of this is, you may recall, one of the reasons why I have spent well, I wont tell you the calculation, but Ive spent several hundred hours face-to-face with our European allies and the heads of state of those countries, and making the case as to why it was overwhelmingly in their interest that they continue to support Ukraine.\n\nThey understand it fully, but theyre not looking to go to war with Russia. Theyre not looking for a third World War. And I think it can all be avoided by making sure that Ukraine is able to succeed in the battlefield.\n\nSo, anyway, theres more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.\n\nWell, thank you all very, very much. I appreciate your time and attention.\n\nAnd as I said, Mr. President, you dont have to worry we are staying with Ukraine as long as Ukraine is there.\n\nThank you all.\n\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKYY: Thank you so much, all you guys.\n\n5:20 P.M.

                "cc_text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN\n\nA fresh barrage of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine on Friday morning put the entire country under air-raid alarm and sent people scrambling for shelter as explosions sounded overhead, with strikes hitting critical infrastructure and knocking out power.\n\n\"They have set a goal to leave Ukrainians without light, water and heat,\" Ukraines Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told a government meeting, adding that 60 of the 76 missiles fired at Ukraine were intercepted by its air defense forces.\n\nRussias persistent and pervasive attacks on Ukraines energy grid have, at least temporarily, left millions of civilians without electricity, heat, water and other critical services in the freezing winter months. Repeated missile and drone attacks since October, which have damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure, are part of a strategy by the Kremlin to terrorize Ukrainians and is in violation of the laws of war, according to experts.\n\nUkrainian energy operator Ukrenergo reported on Friday that more than 50% of the countrys energy capacity was lost due to Russian strikes on thermal and hydroelectric power plants and substations, activating \"emergency mode.\"\n\nCivilians shelter inside a metro station during an air raid alert in the centre of Kyiv. Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The enemy is massively attacking Ukraine. Increased danger. Stay in shelters,\" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app, asking residents not to ignore the alarm.\n\nKyivs mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions had hit the city and that three districts had been struck in the onslaught of rockets, disrupting water supplies across the capital. He suggested residents prepare a stock of drinking water while technicians work to restore the supply, and not to leave shelters as attacks continued.\n\nResidents bundled in winter coats, hats and scarves gathered in Kyivs underground stations as the sirens wailed. Huddled on escalators, their faces were lit by their phones as they scrolled through updates.\n\nOne photo shared by authorities in the Kyiv region showed the fragments of a missile in the snow, which it said the air defense system had downed. Kyiv citys military administration claimed that 37 of 40 missiles targeted at the capital were intercepted.\n\nRegional and city authorities across the country reported explosions and missile strikes hitting civilian infrastructure, and leading to some deaths.\n\nIn the central city of Kryvyi Rih, officials said a Russian missile had hit a three-story residential building, killing at least two people and that emergency services were digging through the wreckage. \"There may be people under the rubble,\" the deputy head of the presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said.\n\nA residential building damaged by a Russian missile in Kryvyi Rih. State Emergency Service of Ukraine/Reuters\n\nAt least 10 missiles struck various targets in Kharkiv region, in the north, damaging energy facilities and a hospital, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the regional military administration. Power was beginning to be restored in Kharkiv city after being knocked out for much of the day. \"There is a colossal infrastructural damage,\" Kharkivs mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said, instructing residents to use so-called \"invincibility points\" makeshift centers offering relief from power outages to collect food and hot drinks, and recharge cellphones.\n\nThe southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia was hit by more than a dozen missile strikes, according to Oleksandr Starukh, chief of the regional military administration, but it was unclear what had been targeted.\n\nMeanwhile, artillery and rocket attacks continued in the southern city of Kherson, which was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November, targeting critical infrastructure, residential buildings, medical aid and public transport, leaving four dead, according to the head of the regions military administration. Shelling also set a multi-storey apartment building ablaze, and the body of a man was found in one apartment, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-Generals Office said. The city is still struggling to restore basic services.\n\nSections of the Ukrainian railway system in Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk region were out of power following the strikes, and back-up diesel locomotives were replacing some services. Ukraines energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said that nine power-generating facitilites were damaged in Fridays attacks, and warned of more emergency blackouts.\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Center, a Ukrainian research and consulting company, said on Ukrainian TV that power outages had been rolled out prior to the strikes as a preventative measure to protect the grid from blackouts. He added that, in spite of this, the result of the attacks Friday morning would be \"unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we already see that they (Russians) are striking at the generating facilities again, trying to cut off our nuclear and thermal power plants, to damage additional key energy hubs, focusing their attacks on these facilities,\" Kharchenko said. \"I urge Ukrainians to understand that the situation is difficult, I urge them to be as prepared as possible for the fact that there will be no quick improvement in the situation with electricity.\"\n\nPolice and investigators inspect a crater at a site of an industrial area destroyed by a Russian missile strike in Kharkiv. Stinger/Reuters\n\nUkraines Armed Forces said Russia pounded the country with 76 missiles, launching cruise missiles from its fleets in the Black and Caspian Seas, and, for the first time, from Tu-95 strategic bombers at the Engels air base, on the Volga River in southern Russia.\n\nThe Engels air base, which is home to Russias long-range, nuclear-capable bombers, was targeted in a drone attack in early December, according to the Kremlin, slightly damaging two planes. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn MiG-31K, a supersonic aircraft capable of carrying a Kinzal hypersonic missile, was also seen in the sky over Belarus during the air attacks on Friday in Ukraine, according to Ukraines Armed Forces. But it was not clear from their statement whether a Kinzal was used in the attacks.\n\n\"The enemy wanted to massively disperse the attention of air defense,\" a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, said. Ukraines top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhny, later said that 60 of the missiles were downed by the countrys air defense forces.\n\nLast Monday, Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraines military intelligence, claimed that Russia had nearly exhausted its arsenal of high-precision weapons, but that it still had enough supplies to inflict harm. He added that Iran has not delivered any ballistic missile to Russia analysis echoed by John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council (NSC).\n\n\"We know that their defense industrial base is being taxed,\" Kirby said of Russia. \"We know theyre having trouble keeping up with that pace. We know that hes (Russian President Vladimir Putins) having trouble replenishing specifically precision guided munitions.\"\n\nCNN is unable to verify the level of Russian missile stocks, which has previously been underestimated by Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the Patriot, the US most advanced ground-based air defense system, to Ukraine, according to two US officials and a senior administration official. Ukraines government has long requested the system to help it defend against repeated Russian missile and drone attacks. It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for members of the North Atlantic Treaty and America (NATO) in eastern Europe.\n\nIn a press briefing on Friday, the White House condemned Russias strikes targeting largely civilian infrastructure. Kirby said that the attacks showed that Moscow was \"again trying to put fear into the hearts of the Ukrainian people and to make it that much harder on them as winter is now upon them.\"\n\nHe declined to announce any details on the next security assistance package for Ukraine, but said that there \"will be another one\" and that additional air defense capabilities should be expected.\n\nThe US and NATO countries have been grappling in recent months with how to help Ukraine defend itself against relentless Russian strikes, which have, according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed about half of the countrys energy infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 70 countries and international organizations pledged more than $1 billion to help repair Ukraines infrastructure. Last week, the Pentagon announced that an additional $275 million in security assistance for Ukraine had been approved, including weapons, artillery rounds and equipment to help Ukraine boost its air defense. In November, the US announced a $53 million package to support repairs to Ukraines power system.\n\nThe \"first tranche\" of the energy-related equipment included in the US package has arrived in Ukraine, Kirby said Friday.",

                "cc_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to visit Washington on Wednesday, according to three AP sources, in his first known trip outside the country since Russias invasion began in February.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nTwo congressional sources and one person familiar with the matter confirmed plans for the visit. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive nature of the trip.\n\nThey said Zelenskys visit, while expected, could still be called off at the last minute due to security concerns.\n\nThe visit to Washington is set to include an address to Congress on Capitol Hill and a meeting with President Joe Biden.\n\nIt comes as lawmakers are set to vote on a year-end spending package that includes about $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and as the US prepares to send Patriot surface-to-air missiles to the country to help stave off Russias invasion.\n\nThe visit comes a day after Zelensky made a daring and dangerous trip to what he called the hottest spot on the 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) front line, the city of Bakhmut in Ukraines contested Donetsk province, where he praised Ukrainian troops for their \"courage, resilience and strength\" as artillery boomed in the background.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader told the troops he passed through Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka to reach Bakhmut in an unannounced trip that appeared designed to show Moscow's failure to capture the city and dishearten the Russians trying to surround it.\n\n\"Bakhmut Fortress. Our people. Unconquered by the enemy. Who with their bravery prove that we will endure and will not give up whats ours,\" he wrote on his Telegram channel, thanking the troops for \"the courage, resilience and strength shown in repelling the enemy attacks.\n\n\"Since May, the occupiers have been trying to break our Bakhmut, but time goes by and Bakhmut is already breaking not only the Russian army, but also the Russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers,\" he said.\n\nRussias invasion, which began Feb. 24, has lost momentum. The illegally annexed provinces of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested. Capturing Bakhmut would sever Ukraines supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press on toward cities that are key Ukrainian strongholds in the Donetsk province.\n\nIn a video released by his office from the Bakhmut visit, Zelensky was handed a Ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to US leaders.\n\n\"The guys handed over our beautiful Ukrainian flag with their signatures for us to pass on,\" Zelensky said in the video. \"We are not in an easy situation. The enemy is increasing its army. Our people are braver and need more powerful weapons. We will pass it on from the boys to the Congress, to the president of the United States. We are grateful for their support, but it is not enough. It is a hint it is not enough.\"\n\nThe latest tranche of US funding would be the biggest American infusion of assistance yet to Ukraine, above even Bidens $37 billion emergency request, and ensure that funding flows to the war effort for months to come.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US was also set to announce that it will send $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine in a major package that will for the first time include a Patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets, US officials said.\n\nThe aid signals an expansion by the US in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to Ukraine to bolster its air defences against what has been an increasing barrage of Russian missiles in recent weeks.\n\nThe package will include about $1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stocks and $800 million in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, officials said.\n\nThe decision to send the Patriot battery comes despite threats from Russias Foreign Ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface-to-air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the Patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for Moscows military.\n\nIts not clear exactly when the Patriot would arrive on the front lines in Ukraine, since US troops will have to train Ukrainian forces on how to use the high-tech system.\n\nThe training could take several weeks, and is expected to be done in Germany. To date, all training of Ukraine's forces by the US and its Western allies has taken place in European countries.\n\nAlso included in the package will be an undisclosed number of Joint Direct Attack Munitions kits, or JDAMs. The kits will be used to modify massive bombs by adding tail fins and precision navigation systems so that rather than being simply dropped from a fighter jet onto a target, they can be released and guided to a target.\n\nThe visit comes at an important moment as the White House braces for greater resistance from a Republican-controlled House thats signaled it will put more scrutiny on aid for Ukraine in the new Congress. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has said his partys lawmakers will not write a \"blank check\" for Ukraine.\n\nBiden and Zelensky frequently have held phone calls in coordination with the White House announcing new tranches of military assistance for Ukraine. The calls have been mostly warm, with Biden praising Ukraine for remaining steadfast against the Russians and Zelensky thanking the US president for support.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who visited Zelensky earlier this year in Kyiv, encouraged lawmakers to be on hand for Wednesday evenings session.\n\n\"We are ending a very special session of the 117th Congress with legislation that makes progress for the American people as well as support for our Democracy,\" Pelosi wrote Tuesday in a letter to colleagues. \"Please be present for a very special focus on Democracy Wednesday night.\"\n\nLater at the Capitol, Pelosi said of Ukrainians, \"They are fighting for democracy for all of us.\"\n\nFor his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday hailed the \"courage and self-denial\" of his forces in Ukraine but he did so at a ceremony in an opulent and glittering hall at the Kremlin in Moscow, not on the battlefield.\n\nMercenaries from the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian military contractor, are reported to be leading the charge in Bakhmut. Unverified videos on a popular Russian social media platform showed the Wagner Group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, standing near an artillery piece and saying he was ready to meet Zelensky in Bakhmut.\n\nAt the Kremlin ceremony, Putin presented awards to the Moscow-appointed heads of the four illegally annexed regions of Ukraine.\n\n\"Our country has often faced challenges and defended its sovereignty,\" Putin said. \"Now Russia is again facing such a challenge. Soldiers, officers and volunteers are showing outstanding examples of courage and self-denial on the front line.\"\n\nIn a video address honouring Russia's military and security agencies, he praised the security personnel deployed to the four regions, saying that \"people living there, Russian citizens, count on being protected by you.\"\n\nPutin acknowledged the challenges faced by the security personnel.\n\n\"Yes, its difficult for you,\" he said, adding that the situation in the regions is \"extremely difficult.\"\n\nBritish authorities, meanwhile, gave a bleak assessment of how the war is going for Russia.\n\nSome 100,000 Russian troops were \"dead, injured or have deserted\" in the invasion, UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said. Wallace didnt give a figure for Ukrainian casualties, but the US military recently put the estimated number of Ukrainian troops killed and wounded at about 100,000.\n\nLosses in Russia's military command have also taken a toll, as has the destruction of equipment. \"Not one single operational commander then in place on Feb. 24 is in charge now,\" Wallace told lawmakers in the House of Commons. \"Russia has lost significant numbers of generals and commanding officers.\"\n\n\"Russian capability has been severely hampered by the destruction of more than 4,500 armored and protected vehicles, as well as more than 140 helicopters and fixed wing aircraft,\" Wallace said.\n\nUkraine's counteroffensive has succeeded in recapturing large swaths of land. After 300 days of war, the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted, Ukraine has liberated about 54% of the maximum amount of extra territory Russia seized in the invasion. It didnt say what portion of Ukrainian territory Russia controlled at the peak of its gains.\n\nRussia now controls about 18% of internationally recognised areas of Ukraine, including those parts of the eastern Donbas and the Crimean Peninsula seized in 2014.\n\nWith the fighting in the east at a stalemate, Moscow has used missiles and drones to attack Ukraines power equipment, hoping to leave people without electricity as freezing weather sets in.\n\nLife in the Ukrainian capital took a minor but welcomed step toward normality with the reopening of two of Kyivs main subway stations for the first time since the war began. The key hubs of Maidan Nezalezhnosti and Khreschatyk, like the capitals other underground stations, have served as air raid shelters.\n\n\"Its the feeling that despite everything, we are returning to a routine that we were used to,\" said 24-year-old passenger Denys Kapustin. \"This is very important.\"\n\n(AP)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

In an annual address Wednesday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the war has strengthened Europe's unity, and that \"no one in the West is afraid and will ever be afraid of Russia.\"\n\nZelensky also thanked Ukrainian servicemen, calling them \"heroes\" and said the powerful weapons Ukraine has received have strengthened its advantage.\n\nIf you're just now catching up, here's what you need to know:\n\nOngoing shelling. Russia struck cities including Kherson and Oleshky in the south and Kharkiv in the east. As fighting near the key Ukrainian city of Kreminna in the eastern Luhansk region continues, Russian civilians who had come to the city have stopped their work and left, according to the head of Luhansk's military administration. If the Ukrainian military is able to dislodge the Russians from Kreminna, the Ukrainian military could then proceed in two directions, the official said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials have called on residents to evacuate Kherson as the city was impacted 23 times over the last 24 hours.\n\nElectricity deficit. Ukraine's power grid electricity deficit grew on Wednesday due to the shelling of gas infrastructure in eastern Ukraine, state power utility Ukrenergo said in an update. Ukraine, which has faced a wide assault on critical infrastructure and power sources since early October, will not experience further power restrictions because of the growing deficit, Ukenergo said. However, the power utility added that \"all regions were informed about consumption limits, the excess of which leads to the need for emergency outages.\" In the last three months, the power grid has suffered nine missile and 12 Russian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attacks, according to Ukrenergo.\n\nPaul Whelan. The White House on Wednesday renewed its commitment to getting US citizen and former Marine Paul Whelan returned from Russian detention on the four-year anniversary of his arrest. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Whelan's detention \"unacceptable\" and said that efforts to secure Pauls release will not cease until he is back home with his family where he belongs.\"",

                "cc_text": "In September, Ukrinform started an expert discussion about the course of the current war by publishing a headline-making article \"Prospects for Running a Military Campaign in 2023: Ukraines perspective\" by Valeriy Zaluzhny and Mykhailo Zabrodskyi. We continued it with Mykhailo Zabrodskyi's notes \"Partial mobilization in the Russian Federation: everything is not so simple\" and the article \"Ukraine needs a long missile arm to make Russias aggression impossible\" by solid-propellant rocket developer Leonid Shyman.\n\nIn November, Mykhailo Zabrodskyi published the article \"Patriotic war. Land military prospects\". And here is the continuation of Mykhailo Zabrodskyis analysis of how we can defeat the enemy in the sky.\n\nThe stunning events of recent months on the front of repelling Russian aggression cause quite a range of different emotions. Quite naturally, the feeling of national pride and firm belief in the bravery of the Ukrainian soldiers and the courage of our commanders are predominant among them.\n\nThe situation on front line has stabilized in the northern and northeastern sections, north of the Siverskyi Donets River. Fierce battles are taking place around Bakhmut, where the enemy does not stop trying to make a double tactical envelopment of this important administrative center of Donetsk region. The enemy left the right bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson area. Such significant changes in the drawing of the Line of Contact, first of all - on the southern strategic flank, continue to dictate new approaches both to the assessment of the general situation and to a more detailed prediction of future events in the military confrontation.\n\nPreviously, we considered possible options for new or re-emerging threats and challenges for the country's defense on land. Now our task is to discuss the prospects for the next in order, but not in importance, domain of warfighting - Air Warfare. There is no doubt that airspace remains an integral component of the armed fighting against the Russian Federation and the key to success in repelling full-scale armed aggression. Despite the multiple superiority in combat potential, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were unable to implement it for several reasons. At the same time, the Ukrainian Air Forces are still unable to seize the initiative due to a critical imbalance of capabilities. A balanced and rapid build-up of both the air \"shield\" and the \"sword\" should become one of the key priorities in the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nA brief history of the topic\n\nFor a better understanding of the current situation and the very subject of discussion, it is necessary to refer to the events at the front in late February and spring of the current year.\n\nThe enemy's powerful aviation and missile attack formations, which were concentrated around our borders, were to become the trump card of the invasion forces of the Russian Federation and ensure absolute superiority both in the Air and on the Ground, leveling a certain parity on land.\n\nDespite the well-known uncertainty in the planning of any large-scale action, it would seem that the air part of the \"special military operation\" plan against Ukraine should not particularly concern the Russian command. Indeed, all objective indicators from numerical superiority to the localization and capabilities of the enemy's air attack means and the means of Ukrainian Air Defense precisely indicated this. After all, all the objective indicators of \"military mathematics\" pointed to the undeniable superiority of the Russian Air Forces, both in the quantitative and qualitative ratio in the Airspace in all the main operational directions, and in other \"multiplicative\" components, as in the ability of the aggressor ensure strategic envelopment of the Theater of War and its availability of a powerful and generally modern long-range missile arsenal for various carriers. If we add to them a certain strategic and operational suddenness, the technical characteristics of missiles and aircraft, and considerable experience in preparing and launching missile and air strikes, then the result of a large-scale \"air invasion\" seemed to leave the enemy in no doubt.\n\nEveryone at the front and in the rear remembers the pitiful March and April. From the first days of the large-scale invasion, up to a hundred enemy aircraft and helicopters could be in the sky of Ukraine and in the surrounding areas at the same time. Considering the mass launch of missiles, the number of air targets on the screens and tablets displaying the aerial situation of the aviation and air defense CPs was measured in the hundreds. The number of cruise missiles alone used against Ukraine in the first three days quickly became comparable to their total consumption in operations in Syria. Priority targets are civilian and military objects in the rear. Terrible acquaintances - \"Iskander\", and not so much - \"Caliber\", words that Ukrainians of all professions and age groups quickly learned. Devastating group strikes by Russian Ground Attack and Rotary Wing aviation along the entire Line of Contact from Kherson region to Polissia. Bombardment from an altitude of 6,000-7,000 m, which is unreachable for the means of direct Air Defense cover of the units, even of individual platoon strongholds. A carousel of dozens of Su-24M (Fencer-D) and Su-34 (Fullback) front-line bombers over surrounded Mariupol. Unceasing air alarm sirens over Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odesa, and our other cities. Yes, all this and much more will not be forgotten.\n\nAccording to the enemy's plans, during the first one to three days of the strategic Air Offensive Operation, the Ukrainian Air Defense should disappear, and within another week, the remnants of combat aviation. It is quite possible that this is exactly what happened. However, not in reality, but only in the victorious reports of Russian generals who were allegedly sent to Moscow in the first weeks of large-scale aggression. In reality, the Ukrainian Air Defense persevered and desperately continued to resist. Having underestimated the level of its survivability, as well as the stability, courage and stubbornness of our pilots and Air Defense crews the enemy defiantly wrote it off from the calculations. The enemy decided that he had gained dominance in the air and began to fulfill his main task - air support of ground groups. This catastrophic miscalculation for the enemy gave our Air Defense a much-needed break and time to regroup.\n\nAs a result, the number of interceptions of air targets turned out to be unexpectedly high for the enemy, although at the time it was disappointing for us in absolute numbers. It turned out that the \"state-of-the-art\" Russian Fullback and Su-35 (Flanker-+), modernized MiGs, Mi and Ka of various indexes, \"Iskanders\" (SS-26 Stone), \"Calibers\" (SS-N-27 Sizzler) and \"Kha-shkis\", which, according to Putin, are \"unique\", are perfectly defined, engaged and fall burning to the ground. The experience of the Russian decorated aces, which they gained by bombing the defenseless cities and towns of Syria, turned out to be completely useless for the War in Ukraine, and the number of \"those who did not return from a combat mission\" of Russian pilots increased rapidly.\n\nEverything that happened and is happening in the air war on the Russian side is now dictated not by design, but exclusively by reaction to the development of events. The transition to missile terror tactics, an increase in the share of fate in the missile strikes of the \"not new\" Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-59 (AS-13 Kingbolt) air-based cruise missiles, the use of the S-300 (SA-10 Grumble) Air Defense system against ground targets, the humiliating purchase of kamikaze drones from Iran and their widespread use by the \"superpower\" against civilian infrastructure is far from a complete list of the Russian Federation's desperate attempts to change the course of events and intercept the strategic air initiative. The decision of the Russian Command regarding the use of air attack means, depending on the orientation of the experts, can be called \"flexible\", \"adaptive, or \"creative\". However, in essence, and this is the most important thing, they are situational. The planned Russian Strategic Air Offensive, which was supposed to clear the way for the land operational groups of the invading troops and quickly force the population of Ukraine to stop resisting, failed.\n\nAt the same time, the relative parity with the enemy in the Air, achieved at a heavy price, is shaky and unstable, and the situation with countering missile terror of the Russian Federation, unfortunately, is far from controlled. The enemy's airstrikes on energy supply facilities have devastating consequences for millions of our compatriots and the national economy. Civilians continue to die from aerial attacks and the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer losses. The enemy's group bombing airstrikes are becoming a thing of the past, but the use of cruise missiles and attack UAVs still pose a mortal danger. At the same time, we must understand that what is happening is significantly different from what should have happened, according to the plans of the Russian Command, even more than six months ago.\n\nSearch for probable causes\n\nLet us consider the objectively probable reasons for the failure of the Russian Air Offensive. More precisely, the question can be narrowed down to a more professional one: what are the reasons for the enemy's non-realization of its combat potential and quantitative and qualitative superiority in the means of warfighting in the Airspace? Advantage can be considered as a double category objective-physical (capabilities available at a certain moment) and subjective-mental (ability to use/implement them with maximum efficiency).\n\nIt is necessary to start with the well-known quantitative and qualitative component of the Air Forces of the Russian Federation, which, obviously, turned out to be somewhat overestimated. The number of Russian combat aircraft in the air group of the invasion, indicated in the estimates of past years, traditionally impressed all experts with three-digit figures and led to a catastrophic calculation ratio for Ukraine [Numerical indicators of the initial quantitative and qualitative ratio of the parties' forces currently remain a subject of debate. Depending on the \"age\" and \"nationality\" of the calculation method used, ratios from 1:7 to 1:30 or more in favor of the enemy are noted.]\n\nAccording to experts, the Russian Federation was and, in principle, remains one of the few countries in the world that has offensive capabilities in airspace. Only the aviation component along our borders, created on the eve of the invasion, consisted of almost half a thousand combat aircraft and several hundred helicopters. It is quite possible that the data were completely adequate if we take as a basis the List of the Numerical Composition of aircraft and helicopters. It should be added that as of February of this year, only the mentioned powerful formation of the Air Force of the Russian Federation in terms of the number of combat aircraft outnumbered the listed aviation fleet of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by approximately four times.\n\nAt the same time, the basis of the Russian formation was precisely modern models of aviation equipment, such as the Flanker-+, Fullback, Su-30 (Flanker-C), Ka-52 (Hokum B), Mi-28 (Havoc), etc. Aircraft and helicopters of early modifications began to be used only later, after incurring irreparable losses in modern models. At the same time, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was armed with physically and morally obsolete samples of aviation equipment and anti-aircraft missile systems of Soviet production, which had long since exhausted their intended resource and had not undergone any significant modernization.\n\nHowever, the course of the first days of the invasion demonstrated that the \"mathematical equations\" of war have too many unknown members that can radically change the outcome. This \"known unknowns\" include such factors as: the narrow specialization of the aviation fleet of the Air Force of the Russian Federation preserved from Soviet practice, the unsatisfactory organization of the overall support of aviation combat operations, the technical imperfection of the critical nomenclature of aviation means of engagement, gaps in the combat, moral and psychological training of the flight crews, unsatisfactory level of the operational Command and Control.\n\nThe imperfections of Russian aviation equipment and weapon need an explanation. Soviet and Russian schools of military aircraft construction occupied leading positions in the world until the last years of the previous century. The appearance of MiG-29 (Fulcrum) and Su-27 (Flanker-B) combat aircraft with their innovative technical solutions caused deep concern in NATO countries. However, the decade of stagnation of Russian industry after the collapse of the USSR and the rapid development of the aviation industry in the West quickly changed the situation to the opposite. The West followed the path of creating multifunctional aviation platforms, while the tradition of the generic division of aviation continued to be preserved in the Russian Air Force. Even their most modern aircraft, pathetically called \"multi-functional\", keep the division according to the main and auxiliary functionality. In military language, they are called the primarily and secondary missions. So, the Fullback is still a front-line bomber with limited air combat capabilities, while the Flanker-C remains primarily a fighter.\n\nWhy is this important? Everything is quite simple. Despite all the dynamics of the Air Warfare, it is linear in the order of execution of combat missions. First - the struggle for superiority in the Air, the destruction of the Command and Control, reconnaissance of the airspace, air defense systems, and combat aviation of the enemy. Then - the execution of missions of airborne landings, isolation of the areas from the air, direct air support of the troops. And finally, launching missile-bomb strikes at strategic depth to disrupt the mobilization of the troops and the economy.\n\nIn practice, if the \"narrow\" specialization of aviation equipment is preserved, while fighters are fighting fierce battles for Air Superiority, ground attack aircraft and bombers will stand idle on airfields, waiting for their time, and vice versa. At the same time, if you are armed with truly multifunctional equipment, you can provide the same capabilities with much smaller forces, changing only the configuration of the air weapon depending on the tasks of the flight mission. That is, despite the significant quantitative indicators of the Russian invasion aviation group, the Ukrainian Air Defense had to deal with only about a third of its number at the same time.\n\nSimilarly, the philosophy of technical solutions embedded in Russian aviation assets of engagement had a negative effect on the course of combat in the Air for the Russian Air Force. For example, anti-radiation missile missiles are the main means of air defense suppression [An anti-radiation missile (ARM) is a missile designed to detect and home in on an enemy radio emission source. It has been widely used, in particular against SAMs, since the sixties of the 20th century.]\n\nRussian ARM of the X-58 (AS-11 Kilter) type (and others) have quite complex tactics of use. To successfully guide the missile to the target, the pilot must engage in a duel with the anti-aircraft missile system operators and for a long time, in fact, in \"kamikaze\" style, conduct a \"frontal attack\" on the SA missile launcher position. To increase their chances, the enemy engages entire units of \"hunter planes\" with a clear division of functions in the \"flock\". But all of this requires pilots to be highly professional, organized, willing to take risks, and self-sacrificing. Everything that Russian pilots lack so much, judging by the fact that there are very few cases of effective suppression of our Ukrainian SAMs, and Russian pilots preferred to kill the civilian population of our cities. At the same time, the AGM-88 HARM ARM (and other modern world aviation weapons), which the Ukrainian aviation has successfully adapted, has a completely different philosophy. An aircraft is often just a carrier platform. Although the pilot can independently select and attack the target, his main task is only to bring the missile to the launch point. The missile can independently search for a target in a defined area, or it can be targeted by another aircraft or a combat control post. Therefore, the numerous modern, or rather \"new\", Russian aviation equipment and means of engagement adhere to the outdated philosophy of air warfare and proved unable to defeat the few, technically outdated, but mentally innovative Ukrainian Air Defense and aviation, supported by Western partners.\n\nAnother likely factor in the failures of Russian aviation is the weak level of comprehensive support for aviation combat operations. Numerous Russian experiments in previous years regarding the transfer of aviation groups to the system of air bases and again to regiments and divisions obviously had a negative impact on the general level of combat readiness and the ability to conduct long-term combat operations away from the home air bases. It is indicative of the fact that at 5-7 main air bases and a dozen operational airfields located around the Ukrainian borders, as well as in Crimea and on the territory of the Republic of Belarus, and which are used by the Russian Air Force to carry out airstrikes, already in the spring it was difficult to notice cases of basing on one airfield more than 14...18 attack aircraft. We can also mention the alleged heart-breaking plan of the Russian Aviation Commanders with the aim of misleading and dispersing the efforts of the Ukrainian Air Defense and any other higher meaning. The explanation of these two features is quite simple. It sounds so familiar - technical serviceability.\n\nIn military practice, the mentioned looks approximately as follows. On the eve of the invasion, the mixed aviation regiment from the 2nd Mixed Aviation Division of the 14th Army of the Air Force and Air Defense, which is stationed in the Chelyabinsk region and is armed with 24 Fullbacks, receives a task to be involved in a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. After overcoming all the accompanying difficulties, 18 fighter-bombers appeared at the Belarusian airfield in February this year. The number 18 in this case is magical and indicative. This is not a squadron, and not two squadrons, and not four or five flight-size units. This is a reality in terms of technical condition, or rather 75% of the total number of bombers in the regiment. The indicator is on the verge of limited combat capability. The hostilities have not yet begun, and a quarter of the aircraft are already missing. A full-size mixed aviation regiment continues to appear in Russian staff estimates. And this applies to the most modern (more precisely, the newest) Russian fighter-bombers of the 4++ generation, which were adopted only in 2014. It is unlikely that the general situation of technical serviceability for aircraft of much earlier types and series looks better.\n\nThe missile component of the Air Offensive turned out to be quite successful. It would seem that the Russian group and massive missile strikes of the first weeks should quickly lead to the destruction of Ukrainian military stocks and defensive objects. The massiveness and systematicity of missile attacks, in addition to significant material damage, led to the disorganization of everyday life, partial panic, and the appearance of a certain number of our compatriots with a sense of the inevitability of disaster.\n\nQuantitative indicators again played a significant role in this. During the first two, the most difficult, months of the large-scale invasion, the average number of enemy missile strikes alone was about 8-10 per day, with an average daily expenditure of up to 15 cruise and ballistic missiles. In addition, the consumption of SS-26 on the first day of the invasion reached a level that later became unattainable for the enemy. More than 80% of the means of air attack consisted of Russian SS-26 and SS-N-27 - ground and sea-based missiles. Even without considering the Russian bet on the rapid advance of ground troops, such devastating air attacks by SS-26 and SS-N-27 should quickly suppress any will of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the civilian population to organized resistance. Skillful use by the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of the significantly limited number of available SAMs and fighter aircraft, combined with measures to disperse, camouflage, and direct Air Defense cover objects and troops, did not allow the enemy to achieve what he intended. Despite the technical imperfection and the minimal experience of using the means of Ukrainian Air Defense before the start of a large-scale invasion, its actions quite surprised the Russian theoreticians who support missile terror and self-sufficiency of the Air Offensive. One of the clear confirmations of this is the subsequent transfer of airstrikes by the enemy specifically to the infrastructure facilities of Ukraine with the aim of creating an extremely complicated economic situation in the country, in particular - in the energy sector, and with the expectation of a long-lasting destructive effect.\n\nUndoubtedly, the human factor is extremely important, if not decisive. We can mention the inability of the Russian Air Force to ensure the safety of the use of aviation from operational airfields. Dozens of charred remains of helicopters and airplanes at the airfields in Chornobayivka or Saki can only be explained by the recklessness and neglect of basic safety rules by the relevant officials. We are also talking about the crews of aircrafts, ships, and missile complexes. We will immediately exclude from the scope of consideration that category of personnel who do not personally expose themselves to danger when using their weapons system. These are the crews of the Tu-22M3 (Backfire) long-range bombers, which strike with impunity from the airspace of the Republic of Belarus or the Russian Federation, the missile-carrying ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla, and the crews of the SS-26 mobile short-range ballistic missile system, which conduct launches from extreme ranges. A completely separate set of professional qualities is needed by pilots of fighter, bomber, and attack aircraft, not to mention the crews of rotary wing aviation.\n\nObviously, the enemy had and continues to have the biggest problems with this category of personnel. The conditions for carrying out tasks on training airfields and in the skies of Syria or the Caucasus were significantly different from Ukrainian realities. And where personal training and fighting qualities should have been most fully manifested, difficulties began there. Charged flight hours and unwillingness to risk one's own life, self-confidence and unpaid housing mortgages, ignorance of the theater of war and the degree of real threat from the Ukrainian Air Defense - everything can be found in the interrogation protocols of Russian pilots who were lucky enough to be captured.\n\nThe assignment of combat tasks to only a narrow circle of the most experienced pilots from the number of pilots released into the reserve or the command staff of aviation units turned out to be a temporary solution. However, the ratio of one \"trained\" to twenty-thirty \"inexperienced\" was clearly not in favor of solving the problem. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, it was also common to send various types of \"operational groups\" of pilots from aviation units and formations, on average up to 30% of the flight crew, to carry out \"special military operation\" tasks. Regardless of the name, such groups of pilots were essentially appointed \"from all those who are capable of something.\" In addition, pilot training takes years, not weeks.\n\nThis cannot be considered absolutely typical. The enemy continues to have enough conditionally trained flight personnel, learns in this war together with us and gains combat experience. The level of professional training of its individual \"specialists\" is much higher than we would like. However, we are talking about the realization of the potential, about mass and quantitative indicators, and in this sense, the situation with the enemy's aviators can hardly be called satisfactory.\n\nAlso, judging by the development of the situation, the \"human factor\" was most fully revealed in the work of the C2 bodies of the air component of the aggressor. The very operational construction of an aviation group on the eve of the invasion did not contribute to ensuring controllability. The \"collective hodgepodge\" of aviation units and units from different military districts, their location on several dozen airfields, unresolved problems of interaction and coordination - all these added problems in the organization of combat employment. And most importantly, strategic miscalculations at the planning stage, lack of understanding of the enemy and the development of the situation, and the inability to quickly adapt to these changes led to the failure of the Russian strategic offensive air operation.\n\nBut, let us be honest, despite all the above, the Russian Federation had and still maintains a significant advantage in terms of potential over the Ukrainian Air Defense and aviation. The \"math of war\" still demonstrates that we should have lost the battle for our airspace. And in fact, the only reason, apart from the courage and heroism of our soldiers, thanks to which we managed to withstand past airstrikes and eliminate this advantage is the absolute superiority over the enemy in the work of our C2 bodies.\n\nObjectively about what has been known for a long time\n\nThe review will remain incomplete without indicating the factors that significantly contributed and continue to contribute to the enemy's performance of the Air Warfare tasks. They can be conditionally divided into two groups: situational and those that operate constantly.\n\nAbsolute similarity and good familiarity of the enemy with the fleet of aircraft and anti-aircraft means of the domestic Air Force have a significant negative impact. Long-term operation and use of practically identical models provides an opportunity to thoroughly study all the features of their combat use and \"weak spots\" in technical characteristics. This allows the enemy to build tactics of using their own air attack means, using the well-known weaknesses of our air defense system, and, if possible, to neutralize the strong ones. This is manifested in the construction of air and missile strikes, selected routes, and flight profiles on various segments of the trajectory to increase the probability of a breakthrough of the Air Defense. In turn, this forces our air defense and combat aviation to constant maneuvers, changes in work modes and extensive use of the remaining resource of air defense systems.\n\nThe frank technical obsolescence of air defense equipment, most of which are developments of 50-60 years ago, in particular air defense systems, does not allow to effectively engage certain types of air targets. First of all, this applies to small objects, ballistic targets, and hypersonic air-launched missiles. But not only SS-26 and SS-N-27 are an undeniable threat. Missiles of the X-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) or P-800 \"Onyx\" (SS-N-26 Strobile) type are also extremely difficult targets for our Air Defense to intercept. Theoretically, the SA-10 anti-aircraft missile systems could engage them, but Ukraine does not have the appropriate anti-missiles for them.\n\nFor the planes of our tactical aviation, for example, the lack of an active jamming station, which should act on the main element of modern radars - the monopulse direction finder, is fatal. In addition, the planes of our tactical aviation do not have effective on-board EW complexes capable of protecting them from the enemy SA/AA missiles. Moreover, given the enemy's use of Pantsir S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) mobile air defense systems, combat flight missions in the area of the Line of Contact are always associated with significant danger, since regular airborne radiation warning stations are unable to detect the radar operations of this air defense system.\n\nNot the last role is played by technical wear and tear, losses, damages and, as a derivative of them, the unsatisfactory level of technical readiness of air defense equipment and aircraft.\n\nThere remains a group of constantly acting factors. The most significant among them is the numerical superiority of the means of air attack, beyond which even the tactical and technical characteristics of the models cease to play a decisive role. In other words: it is the banal insufficient number of air defense systems and fighter aircraft that has an effect. This is especially critical when repelling group and massive enemy missile strikes. Let us not forget about the usual limitations in the available stocks of SA missiles for the old park's Air Defense systems.\n\nFor long-term planning, it is important to understand the currently existing disproportion between the number of cover objects and the number of Air Defense assets, taking into account losses. Former calculation methods no longer provide the possibility of estimating quantitative indicators for means of air cover. The reason for this lies in the different level of development of military technologies and the degree of branching of the infrastructure that ensures the functioning of the state and the well-being of citizens. The experience of the War, the selectivity and targeting of the enemy's use of air attack force a revision of the existing calculation norms for the number of anti-aircraft weapons and stocks of SA missiles.\n\nThe existing numerical composition of forces and means of air defense physically does not allow to create an echeloned Air Defense over the entire territory of the country. Currently, we have limited capabilities to effectively intercept ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and attack UAVs. At one time, the architecture of our Air Defense system was mainly built in Soviet times and was intended to combat aircraft at low altitudes and above. And it successfully completed this task. But most cruise missiles and attack UAVs on the route fly at extremely low altitudes of 50...150 m. In this altitude echelon, the available SA missile systems can cover a small part of the country's territory. That is why when we note the interception of 70...90% of the enemy's missiles, it should be attributed only to the skill of the personnel of our Air Force.\n\nThe drawing of state borders with the Russian Federation and Belarus, which covers the territory of our state and the coastal strategic southern flank, also refers to constantly acting factors. The use of the water area of the Black Sea, the airspace and the territory of the Republic of Belarus allows the enemy to increase the total front of the likely directions of airstrikes by almost three times. And since the summer of this year, the \"emphasis\" on the use of air- and sea-based cruise missiles by the Russians, in addition to being an objective indicator of their stockpiles, also has considerable operational significance.\n\nIt is impossible to deny the enemy the skillful use of two such familiar, but difficult to predict in the pre-war period, components of military confrontation in the Air Warfare.\n\nOne of them is the use of airborne early warning and control aircraft of the Beriev A-50 (Mainstay) type and its modifications. This allows the enemy to control the air situation hundreds of kilometers deep into the territory that is on our side of the Line of Contact. This is especially critical for monitoring the actions of our fighter and bomber aircraft. Individual cases of interception of our aircraft in the depths of our territory with the help of long-range missiles of the AA type by targeting from the Mainstay have already been noted. At the same time, the detection range of domestic Air Defense means is practically determined by the characteristics of the spread of radio waves in the meter and centimeter bands.\n\nAnother was the widespread use by the enemy of radio-electronic suppression of anti-aircraft weapons in view of the weak protection of our Air Defense systems from its influence. It is noteworthy that for the performance of these missions, means of not the newest Russian models are involved, and the reason for their effectiveness lies exclusively in the technical imperfection of domestic Air Defense equipment.\n\nWhy the Air again?\n\nRussia's by no means limitless stocks of cruise missiles of the SS-26 family and the minimal possibilities for their production in the face of sanctions pressure force the Russians to look for other, more affordable means of destruction to accomplish their tasks. The first such step was the transition to the widespread use of attack UAVs of the Shahed family. The next step, which is already being observed, is the transfer of the bulk of strike tasks to air-based cruise missiles. At the same time, given the limited stocks of SS-26-type cruise missiles, their use in the medium term will become more selective and is expected to target HVTs.\n\nIn the future, considering the effectiveness of missile weapons systems, which use a ballistic trajectory or a ballistic descent on the final part of the trajectory, the most probable is the expansion of the scope of their employment. In this situation, the advanced Iranian replicas of the Soviet-Chinese Fateh-110 ballistic missiles and their improved Zolfaghar version, the possibility of supplying which to the Russian Federation was noted as recently as two months ago, pose a mortal danger to facilities throughout the territory of our country. The characteristics of range and accuracy, as well as the natural technical complexity of intercepting a ballistic target and the limitations of Ukraine in the necessary means encourage the enemy to consider just such an option.\n\nThe situation with the organization of the operation of aviation equipment in the Russian Armed Forces is unlikely to improve for a few reasons, but the enemy still can maintain and expand the aviation group due to its impressive numbers. Russia continues to transfer aviation equipment from the \"rear\" military districts to replenish the losses incurred and still has enough resources to conduct the battle in the Airspace at the current intensity for several years to come. The fact that the number of the aviation group around Ukraine has remained almost unchanged since the beginning of the invasion, however, its qualitative composition has significantly deteriorated, as the Russian side is forced to replace modern lost aircraft and helicopters with outdated modifications, sometimes even removed from storage, is indicative.\n\nThe situation with strategic aviation, in particular with the fleet of Backfire and Tu-95MS (Bear-H) missile-carrying bombers, does not seem to worry the Russian Command, because there are no losses in the air among these aircraft. At the same time, the listed number of fighter-bombers Flanker-C, fighters Fullbacks and Flanker-+ - the main models of strike aircraft of the Russian Air Force, still makes it possible to easily replenish losses of aviation equipment. Considering the crucial importance of the use of air attack means, the command of the Russian Armed Forces seems to be ready to take exactly such measures, sometimes even giving in to the need to maintain the balance of the air presence in other regions.\n\nRussian stocks of air-launched cruise missiles, especially modern ones, like any military stocks, are not unlimited. However, there is no reason for optimism in this. Simply waiting and hoping that the airstrikes will cease due to the enemy's lack of weapons is the worst thing that can be done in the current situation. To the simple question: when this can happen, there is an equally simple answer - never. It is safe to say that the Russian leadership has been busy searching for a way out of this situation for more than a month. And certain solutions are already being implemented. One of them is based on the relative availability of air and missile armaments for external supply. Monetary costs or obligations to partners can eliminate for the Russian Federation problems associated with continuing the design or increasing the production of air attack weapon. To some extent, this situation is somewhat like the Ukrainian one, when we do not have a particular choice, but must accept as help what our partners offer or can afford to offer.\n\nThe winter period to some extent complicates the rapid maneuver of air defense assets. Note that in conditions of numerical superiority of air attack means over anti-aircraft means, such a maneuver is the key to successful countermeasures.\n\nA decrease in the dynamics of the actions of ground troops will probably lead to relative stabilization along the entire length of the Line of Contact. Under the condition of effective use of reconnaissance means, the possibility of detecting and hitting targets increases due to the decrease in their degree of mobility. The location and configuration of the air defense system are becoming more fixed and predictable. This opens certain opportunities for the enemy to plan to successfully overcome zonal air defense on the Line of Contact, which means the possibility of returning to the wide use of strike aircraft against objects in the operational rear and in the depths of the country's territory.\n\nFocusing on air attacks makes it possible not to reduce the intensity of hostilities not only on the front, but also throughout the country, regardless of the probable maneuvers of groups of land troops. For civil infrastructure, first of all - for energy facilities, failure in the cold period of the year is more painful and requires incomparably greater efforts to restore. There is no need to talk about the fact that the country's energy system is already teetering on a dangerous edge. In addition, the critical infrastructure of our country is not limited exclusively by energy facilities.\n\nThe purely military purpose of continuing and escalating airstrikes on objects in our rear can be disruption of the planned training of troops, restoration of combat capability, supply of new types of weapons and military equipment. It means that the targets of airstrikes can again be military training areas, supply bases, storage sites, and defense industrial facilities.\n\nAnd subsequently, the focus on airstrikes preserves the possibility of speculation and political pressure on the country's leadership and the international community by exploiting the reality of a regional energy disaster. To some in the leadership of the Russian Federation, the above seems to be the key to the successful completion of the \"special military operation\" and victory over Ukraine. Such plans are not only another reason to assert their reckless nature and lack of prospects, but also to emphasize the seriousness of the enemy's further intentions.\n\nThere will be a continuation\n\nIt should be noted once again that the enemy is also conducting a further search for ways to realize the potential of air superiority. And a number of the mentioned problematic issues, or even a wider list of them, are of no less concern to the Russian command than to us. It is only logical that we should expect to improve existing or introduce new steps and evaluate innovative approaches to Air Warfare. At least three such possibilities are seen today.\n\nAttacks by enemy UAVs, primarily on infrastructure facilities, will continue. If we take the observation of September-November as a basis, then the available and declared for delivery under Iranian contracts may be enough for another two or three months. It is possible to build up Russian production and expand the range of UASs that will be used. During this time, with effective planning of airstrikes, it can cause severe damage to our civilian facilities and industry. In addition, the goal of massive UAV attacks will remain the exhaustion of the Air Defense system and the forcing of excessive use of SA missiles. Despite the high percentage of interception, given the cost of SA missiles and the moral and economic consequences of strikes, UAVs will remain one of the main types of Air Warfare weapons. Soon, creative options for complex UAV and cruise missile strikes or duplicating the engagement of HVTs will begin to appear.\n\nThe enemy will try to get the maximum benefit from the technical complexity of intercepting ballistic targets. It is likely to increase the strikes by means of air attack that reveal themselves to be ballistic targets for our air defense, for example Zolfaghar ballistic missiles with a flight range of up to 700 km declared by the manufacturer. Further \"background\" use by the enemy of cruise missiles, or even outdated \"Tochka-U\" (SS-21 Scarab A) to complicate the construction of missile strikes and overload Ukrainian air defense, is not excluded.\n\nThe above in no way precludes the continued selective use of SS-26 and SS-N-27 cruise missiles against the most important targets in our rear. Selectivity will be determined by the number of missiles, which will remain limited due to difficulties with production, and more precisely, with the supply of components under international sanctions pressure.\n\nTasks for today for a successful tomorrow\n\nAsking questions is usually much easier than offering answers to them. War in the air has always been a devastating combination of measures to cover one's own troops and objects from airstrikes while simultaneously inflicting maximum damage on the enemy. Such an exquisite dance with aerial \"shield and sword\" is known to everyone, and especially to military professionals, since the times of the wars of the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen considering an air \"shield\" for Ukraine, it is necessary to start with solving the problem of acquisition air targets, because \"seeing\", especially in relation to cruise missiles, attack, bomber aircraft and attack UAVs, is very often much more difficult than hitting. Today, such a task is solved by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by skillful maneuvering of detection means to constantly put the enemy in front of a new configuration of the radar field, for which he again needs time and resources. However, this approach is more typical for covering groups of troops than rear-line objects, and it is used in a certain forced manner. The ideal option would be to build a continuous radar field covering the entire altitude echelon, including extremely low ones. It is not cheap and not soon, but such a goal should be set. And no funds should prevent the reliable protection of the lives of civilians in the rear and military personnel on the battlefield. Not to mention the fact that economic losses from airstrikes can exaggerate the specified costs by an order of magnitude.\n\nIn addition, the capabilities of detecting air targets and targeting interceptors can be provided by air situation control systems that implement the NATO standard for information exchange Link-16. The production and improvement of the domestic model of such a system - \"Oreanda-PS\" has been going on for more than a year. At the same time, an immediate solution may be the supply of such systems from abroad. It is important that our partners also understand the need for such a \"hot\" solution. In particular, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, US Army General Mark Milley, noted in October of this year that \"...whatever systems will be delivered to Ukraine as a result, they will be combined into one joint structure, in which the exchange of information will be ensured\".\n\nAhead is joint systematic work with partners to re-equip the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with anti-aircraft missile systems. Despite the similar need for immediate decisions, since the threat of enemy airstrikes is daily, it is necessary to consider two essential factors. First, it is the presence of objective opportunities and political will of our partners. Unfortunately, anti-aircraft missile systems are not among the types of weapons that can be stored at arsenals for decades, so their \"stockpiles\" are extremely small. An exception can be made only by air defense systems of earlier types, or those stored as reserves. It means that any decision on the transfer of air defense systems to Ukraine is made and will be made by any country, first, to the detriment of its own security. In addition, Ukraine is currently not in a position to refuse foreign aid or to put forward its own conditions. Secondly, it is critically important to prevent the formation and accumulation in the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of a diverse \"zoo\" of heterogeneous air defense systems of foreign production. Of course, we should not forget about the standardization and interoperability of almost all types of similar weapons among NATO countries and outside the Alliance. However, we must remember that the real or potential threat of Russian airstrikes unfortunately will not disappear either tomorrow or even after the end of the War. The use and operation of heterogeneous systems of high-tech weapons such as air defense systems has always been and will remain a serious challenge for a long time. That is why the future architecture of the domestic Air Defense system, as far as air defense assets are concerned, should already be clearly formed, agreed upon and accepted for implementation by us and our partners.\n\nToday, there is a clear need to equip the Air Force of Ukraine with air defense systems of three classes in terms of the range of hitting air targets: short range - up to 40 km; medium range - up to 100 km; long-range - more than 100 km [The classification by range is given in accordance with the one adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the widespread world standards for the classification of air defense systems provides for a short range - up to 40 km; average range - up to 80 km; long-range complexes - up to 150 km and more.]\n\nModern calculations show that the need for air defense systems of the specified classes is about two-thirds, less than a third and 8...10%, respectively. The filling of such a structure with the corresponding material parts has already begun. For example, the IRIS-T SL air defense system developed under the leadership of German specialists, the American MIM-23 Hawk family, and the Norwegian-American NASAMS 2 in their current configurations are typical representatives of the short-range air defense system class to replace the Soviet Buk-M1 (SA-17 Grizzly). Next should be the filling of the medium-range air defense system component to replace the SA-10 air defense system. Such a complex for the Ukrainian Air Force in the near future may be the French SAMP/T with a stated range of up to 100 km and the ability to intercept ballistic targets or the Israeli Barak-8 with a stated range of up to 90 km. The use of the American MIM-104 Patriot in the modification of the PAC-3 will also provide serious advantages. In the future, as a long-range air defense system, provided that the partners make appropriate decisions, it is possible to use, for example, the American THAAD.\n\nAt the same time, these medium-range and long-range air defense systems will make it possible to fill the gaps in the capabilities of the national Air Defense to combat ballistic targets. It should be noted that the traditional continuity and unification of most models of foreign armaments of Air Defense forces allow only by changing the equipment and nomenclature of SA missiles to significantly expand the capabilities of the complex itself. So, for example, the more advanced NASAMS-3, subject to the use of certain types of missiles from the AIM-120 line, is already considered a medium-range air defense system. The technical capabilities of the main Soviet medium-range SA-10 for the Ukrainian Air Force have not been fully exhausted. So, for example, when using the \"long-range\" SA missile 9M83M, the not new SA-10 becomes a long-range complex.\n\nThe priority tasks of aviation are and will remain ensuring superiority in the Air and improving capabilities for the air strikes. According to the assessments of domestic experts, objectively, the issue of maintaining the existing aircraft fleet does not arise before the Ukrainian Air Force as such. As is well known, our aviation \"squeezes\" the necessary resource from the available fleet beyond any regulations and safety margins. And if in the conditions of a full-scale war it is quite possible, then after its end, most of the aviation equipment will likely to be decommissioned. In addition, this fact also rejects the possibility of further modernization, which in the absolute majority of cases loses its meaning if the aircraft platform is physically worn out.\n\nIt remains to purchase or supply with material and technical assistance. But this is traditionally a long and financially burdensome option. As in the case of anti-aircraft missile systems, the world market for combat aircraft is quite limited. The production cycle takes months, if not years, and the queue for the purchase of basic models of modern multi-purpose fighters is drawn up for years. In addition, the issue of the sale of combat aircraft has always been politicized, and therefore requires a certain consensus between the manufacturer and the government of the country concerned. Even if you look at the used equipment market, it is just as limited. Just as there is a queue at the manufacturer's factories, there is no less a queue of people wishing to buy \"second-hand\" aircraft on the secondary market. Only a few countries have significant stockpiles of aviation equipment in storage, such as the United States, but given their own ambitions and the growing risks of global confrontation, they are also reluctant to consider the transfer of this important mobilization resource. In addition, all equipment on the secondary market (either from storage or from military units after rearmament) will require at least major repairs or even modernization. And this also requires time and financial costs.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that work with partners should not be conducted. Already now it is necessary to conduct negotiations on aviation \"lend-lease\". These can be multipurpose fighters of the F-16 type Block 50/52 or even Block 40/42 from storage bases or decommissioned after the rearmament of military units (as the most likely option in the near future). And even if these are not the latest versions, they still outperform the Soviet MiGs in terms of their tactical and technical characteristics, they will help compensate for the losses suffered by our aviation and gain the necessary experience in the operation of Western aviation equipment. It must be considered that they are likely to become consumables in our war, so now it does not make sense to seek to get aircraft \"off the assembly line\". In the future, it is necessary to focus efforts on obtaining more modern types of aircraft: the same F-16, but already in the Block 70/72 modification, F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, Swedish JAS 39E/F Grippen, or even F -35. However, as in the case of SA missile, based on several reasons, it is desirable to preserve the maximum uniformity of the line of aviation equipment.\n\nAs with SAM, the decisions made are likely to be decisive for a sufficiently extended period. The \"trial and error\" method, given the criticality of the situation and limited financial resources, is unlikely to work. Practically, it means that stopping at one of the options or their combination will determine the prospects for the development and equipment of combat aviation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for years and decades.\n\nThe aerial \"sword\" should be combined strikes against the stationary targets of the enemy, first against the airfields of the base of the Russian strike aircraft and the areas of the launch positions of ballistic and cruise missiles. This will enable the Air Force and the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole to move from repelling airstrikes to retaliatory strikes, as well as preventive targeted strikes. Based on the actual and probable placement of this type of targets, there is an urgent need for means of destruction capable of hitting targets of the specified type in the territory controlled by the enemy at least to a depth of 150...250 km. Currently, at least two ways of solving this issue are considered. The first should be the expansion of the capabilities of strike aviation due to the use of more advanced models of aviation and missile weapons. The second is to increase the range of the M-142 HIMARS complexes equipped with ATACMS missiles. Successful combined strikes at a limited depth have already entered the practice of combat work of the Air Force and missile units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Currently, they are limited only to the technical characteristics of certain types of weapons. The possibility to reach the airfields of the base of strike aircraft and the areas of the starting positions of the enemy's ground-based cruise missiles remains ideal. This ability to \"equalize the range\" immediately transforms the air war for the Russians and their satellite from an exciting adventure with combat launches into a deadly drudgery.\n\nA brief overview of the history, current situation, and probable prospects of confrontation in the Air in the course of repelling large-scale aggression allows us to draw several main conclusions.\n\nThe bet on the air component was, is and will remain one of the main ones in the plans of Russian strategists. This approach allows the enemy to count on obtaining a significant advantage in all key areas of military conflict: from military to political.\n\nDespite a number of significant obstacles, the search for novel approaches and the enemy's persistence in continuing the Air War by all available means is an objective reality. The likely targets of further air attacks will remain the objects of civil infrastructure, first of all - the energy sector, and the administrative centers of our country.\n\nContinuation of the protection of the airspace and objects of the strategic rear of the state should remain a priority task of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The successful completion of such a task is possible only on the condition of adopting and implementing a set of systemic measures to increase the capabilities of countering the enemy in the Air and from the Air.\n\nWe understand it and we can do it.",

Ukraine has already received American financial and military funding from approved assistance worth around $54 billion. The U.S. supply of long-range missiles (HIMARS) has played a major role in Ukraines recent battlefield advances in Kharkiv and Kherson, after its heavy losses in Donbas. The Patriot missile system is expected to strengthen Ukraines air defences at a time when Russia is bombarding the energy grid and water supplies. In Washington, President Joe Biden discussed a 10-point peace formula with Mr. Zelensky (the details are unknown) and also promised continued support \"for as long as it takes\". Both leaders tried to send out a message of unity amid concerns of cracks in the western alliance as the war is continuing indefinitely with its massive economic costs.\n\nThe U.S. has gradually stepped up its supply of weapons to Ukraine, but is still wary of sending offensive weapons out of fears of escalating the conflict. Ukraine has relentlessly campaigned for more advanced weapons, including U.S. aircraft, tanks and long-range tactical missiles. While Mr. Biden said his administration would continue to back Ukraine, he also warned of the risks of sending offensive weapons to Ukraine, which could \"break up NATO, the EU and the rest of world\". Currently, Ukraine has a battlefield advantage, recapturing swathes of territories in the northeast and south. But Russia has air superiority. The Patriot missiles could offer some protection to Ukraine but could also prompt Russia to carry out heavier attacks. This leaves Mr. Biden in a dilemma. He is ready to bolster Ukraines defence but does not want to provoke a wider war between Russia and NATO. His Ukraine policy should not be an open-ended weapons supply package. The U.S. could help its ally but it should also push for a sustainable solution to the conflict. It should use its continued support to Ukraine to mount pressure on Russia as its weapons play a critical role in Kyivs counterattacks and persuade Ukraine to resume direct negotiations. At this point, no military solution seems likely. Unless there is a credible push for talks, the war is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nTo read this editorial in Tamil, click here.\n\nTo read this editorial in Hindi, click here.",

Otherwise, the issue will be decided by the Russian army.\"\n\nPutin launched his invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, calling it a \"special operation\" to \"denazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine, which he said was a threat to Russia. Kyiv and the West say Putins invasion was merely an imperialist land grab.\n\nWhile Moscow had planned a swift operation to take over its neighbour, the war is now in its 11th month, marked by many embarrassing Russian battlefield setbacks and Ukraines successful defence of most of its land.\n\nIn the latest attack to expose gaps in Russias air defences, a drone believed to be Ukrainian penetrated hundreds of kilometres through Russian airspace on Monday, causing a deadly explosion at the main base for its strategic bombers.\n\nFierce fighting\n\nRussian forces have been engaged for months in fierce fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, to defend the lands Moscow proclaimed it annexed in September and which make up the broader Ukrainian industrial Donbas region.\n\nThe Ukrainian top military command said on Monday that Russian forces carried out 19 attacks over the past day in the area. Russias defence ministry said it had advanced its positions in the region and its missile troops and artillery had hit 63 Ukrainian units in the previous day.\n\nIn his nightly video message on Monday, Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the situation along the frontline in Donbas \"difficult and painful\".\n\n\"Bakhmut, Kreminna and other areas in Donbas require a maximum of strength and concentration,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"The occupiers are deploying all resources available to them and these are considerable resources to make some sort of advance.\"\n\nOleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv, said heavy fighting was going on around elevated areas near Kreminna in the Luhansk region.\n\nHe also said that fighting has picked up along the Bakhmut and Avdiivka, a line of contact further south in the Donetsk region, after a brief easing in previous days, with Russian forces launching a series of attacks in the area.\n\n\"The arc of fire in Donetsk region continues to burn. There has been very little change on either side of the front line in Donetsk region,\" Zhdanov said in a social media video post.\n\nZelenskyy said as a result of Russias targeting of energy infrastructure nearly nine million people were without power. That figure amounts to about a quarter of Ukraines population.\n\nSergey Kovalenko, head of YASNO, which supplies electricity to Kyiv, said late on Monday that while the power situation has been improving in the city, blackouts will continue.\n\n\"While repairs are underway, emergency shutdowns will continue,\" Kovalenko said on his Facebook page.\n\nTens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died in cities Russia razed to the ground, and thousands of troops on both sides have been killed, forcing Putin to call up hundreds of thousands of reservists for the first time since World War Two.\n\nRussian airspace\n\nMoscow on Monday said it had shot down a drone believed to be Ukrainian, causing it to crash at the Engels air base, where three service members were killed. Ukraine did not comment, under its usual policy on incidents inside Russia.\n\nA suspected drone struck the same base on 5 December.\n\nThe base, the main airfield for the bombers that Kyiv says Moscow has used to attack Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, is hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian frontier. The same planes are also designed to launch nuclear-capable missiles as part of Russias long-term strategic deterrent.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said in a statement no planes were damaged, but Russian and Ukrainian social media accounts said several had been destroyed. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports.\n\nPutin hosted leaders of other former Soviet states in St Petersburg on Monday for a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States group, which Ukraine has long since quit.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has been a test of Russias longstanding authority among other ex-Soviet states.\n\nIn televised remarks, Putin made no direct reference to the war, while saying threats to the security and stability of the Eurasian region were increasing.\n\n\"Unfortunately challenges and threats in this area, especially from the outside, are only growing each year,\" he said.\n\n\"We also have to acknowledge unfortunately that disagreements also arise between member states of the commonwealth.\"\n\nRead more with EURACTIV",

But Mr. Zelensky arrives in Washington at a pivotal time for Ukraine, when his troops lightning counteroffensives from this fall are slowing down. He will be pleading for the more powerful weapons he believes Ukraine needs, but he will have to walk a fine line.\n\nBy taking a daring trip abroad during wartime, he is seeking to project strength and show confidence that Ukraine will ultimately prevail. But to make the case for continued financial and military support, he needs to draw attention to the dire threat Ukraine still faces without seeming weak.\n\nImage President Volodymyr Zelensky visiting the southern city of Kherson last month. He is venturing into the field more often to project confidence. Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times\n\n\"President Zelensky would like to present this trip as serious progress in the war,\" Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity Party, said in an interview. \"Its a pretty clear message that the alliance of the United States and Ukraine is maintained and is quite strong.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, the visit was also seen as tied to the American political calendar, coming as control of the House passes to the Republican Party, some of whose members have voiced skepticism of continuing to funnel assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAnother of Mr. Zelenskys principal aims, analysts say, is to maintain unified American support for the war, doing whatever he can to avoid having it devolve into a partisan issue.\n\n\"Zelensky should not maneuver between the Democrats and Republicans,\" Yevhen Mahda, a political commentator in Kyiv, said in an interview. \"He should suggest a new paradigm the paradigm that Ukraine today is at the epicenter of the battle between good and evil.\n\n\"And by supporting Ukraine, the United States supports good,\" Mr. Mahda added. \"This is the necessary message.\"\n\nImage Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, has proved to be a master of political messaging. He spoke to Congress in a virtual address in March. Credit... Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times\n\nMr. Zelensky, a former comedian, has always had a keen sense of image and storytelling in politics, which is evident in his following up a frontline visit to the eastern city of Bakhmut with booming artillery as a backdrop with his address to Congress.\n\n\"Its an honor for me to be here today,\" Mr. Zelensky had told the soldiers in Bakhmut, where Russia has been pressing a fierce offensive for months. To those with children, he said, \"I wish that your sun, that is your children, will shine for you, for them to motivate you to survive, for sure, and defend your families, our families, all of our state and the future of our children.\"\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday with President Biden in Washington, where he delivered a personal plea for more economic and military support, he had a similar message when asked what he would want the world to know: \"I wish you peace,\" he said, switching from Ukrainian to English. \"And you understand it only when the war is in your country.\" He added: \"I wish you to see your children when they will go to universities, and to see their children.\"\n\nAnalysts say that Mr. Zelensky is also keenly aware that he needs to bolster the morale of his people, millions of whom are living without electricity, water or heating as winter sets in.\n\nFor the most part, however, Mr. Zelensky faced no political pressure at home and was free to tailor the trip to the imperative of filling out his militarys arsenal for the war.\n\nImage Ukrainian forces firing an M777 howitzer, supplied by the United States, toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in June. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\n\nThe United States is by far the largest foreign supplier of weapons to the Ukrainian Army. But the Biden administration has carefully calibrated its assistance to Ukraine, holding back longer-range and more powerful weapons for fear of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory that could drag NATO into the war.\n\nTwo successful Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeast and in the south have run their course, and the Russian and Ukrainian armies are digging in along a new, 600-mile front line. To maintain that progress, Ukrainian officials and analysts say, its military needs more advanced weapons systems.\n\nMr. Zelensky will have the opportunity to address the concerns of U.S. lawmakers about the oversight of military and financial aid to Ukraine, and he could be pushed on domestic matters like press freedom, fighting corruption and ensuring checks and balances between the courts and executive branch.\n\nBut Mr. Zelenskys major objective is to portray the war in stark terms of good versus evil that he hopes will transcend American politics and will give \"a sense of the rightness of his cause and the sense of what his people and his soldiers feel,\" said Yuri Makarov, the editor in chief of the Ukrainian national broadcasting company.\n\nMaria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv.",

The question arises, for what? Russia has always met us halfway. There is not a single issue that has remained unresolved today. We are meeting the Russian Federation halfway in the most difficult moment,\" Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state news agency BelTA.\n\n\"If someone is hatching up plans to tear us apart, to drive a wedge between us, they will not succeed.

They wanted to deprive us of both independence and sovereignty,\" he claimed.\n\nBelarus saw mass protests in 2020 after an election that many observers believe was rigged to keep long-term leader Lukashenko in power. The protests were met with a harsh response from Belarus' security services. Lukashenko baselessly blamed the West for inciting the demonstrations. Russia said it was ready to support Lukashenko's leadership should the protests get \"out of control.\"\n\nFollowing months of increased joint military exercises and meetings, concerns have grown that Belarus could enter the Ukraine war to assist Russia (it has already allowed Moscow to launch attacks from its territory). On Monday, Lukashenko said nothing would be able to \"break our relationship\" with Russia but did not mention the possibility of Belarus assisting Russia in the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"So what is there to say? Just one more time: they will not be able to break our relationship. It will only strengthen. Today, in fact, together with the president and our colleagues, we have created a base for the future rapid progress,\" Lukashenko said.\n\nHolly Ellyatt",

In his plan, the glow of fantasy is fueled by nostalgia for Golden Age nostrums that have no cure-all value for the war thats actually happening.\n\nIn an article for this weekends Spectator, the former statesman-historian proposes a cease-fire and a return to the pre-invasion borders of this past February. In other words, he is suggesting that Russia withdraw all its troops from the areas of Ukraine that it has conquered this yearbut not from Crimea or the thin slice of eastern Ukraine that it annexed or occupied back in 2014. The disposition of those territories, he argues, should be negotiated or settled through an internationally supervised referendum.\n\nThis idea is neither new nor particularly ingenious. Kissinger notes that he proposed the idea in May; others put forth similar ideas before then. There isand always has beenjust one problem: Russian President Vladimir Putin has absolutely no interest in going along with it. He has no interest in withdrawing his troops, an act that he would see, quite properly, as a defeat. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, also quite properly, has no interest in a cease-firewhich the Russian army would use as an opportunity to regroup and mobilizeunless Putin first withdraws all his troops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, the idea is a nonstarter, the article a complete waste of timeexcept in one sense: It exposes the limits of a way of thinking about international politics, at least as it applies to the Russia-Ukraine war, and it exposes the limits of Kissingers relevance to the 21st century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKissinger is 99 years old. It is natural, even for those a decade or two younger than that, to pine for the glory days of yore, or at least to view present crises through the prism of a more orderly past. Out of power now for nearly a half-century, eager to preserve his status as a public intellectual worthy of attention and influence, Kissinger must look back with fondness on the work that first marked his standing as a serious scholarhis Ph.D. dissertation, which he turned into the 1957 book A World Restored. In it, he recounted the tale of how the two great statesmen of the early 19th century, Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and British Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh, carved out a new European order at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the end of the Napoleonic warsan order that kept the peace for 100 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt remains a gripping book and, more important, a template for the branch of International RealismRealpolitikthat sees balance-of-power politics as the key to peace in all times. Viewed in this context, Kissingers Spectator article is an attempt to impose the lessons of his dissertation on the war in Ukraine. The problem is, the two dont fit.\n\nKissinger begins his article with a brief rundown of the First World War. It began in 1914, when, as he notes, Europes leaders sleepwalked into a conflict that none of them would have entered if theyd foreseen the consequences four years later. It started almost by accident. The assassination of the Austrian crown prince triggered an automatic escalation, as the leaders of two sets of alliances activated their rigid schedules for troop mobilizationGermany attacking Belgium in order to defeat France, France reacting accordingly, and other countries entering the fray, as their commitments dictated. Two years into the war, the combatant nations, mired in the stalemate of trench warfare, sought mediation from the United States, but President Woodrow Wilson held off for another two years, until after his reelection, by which time another 2 million soldiers had been slaughtered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKissinger then asks: \"Does the world today find itself at a comparable turning point in Ukraine as winter imposes a pause on large-scale military operations there?\"\n\nThe question is nonsensical. There are no parallels whatsoever between the wars of 1914 and 2022. The present war started when Russia invaded Ukraine, period. Russia was not provoked to invade by any interlocking alliances. (Putin may have feared that Ukraine might join NATO, but there was absolutely no such prospect on the horizon.) Ukraine was not tethered to any alliance at all. (The U.S. and its NATO allies gradually aided Ukraine with weapons and intelligence, as Russia intensified its aggression, but they have resolutely avoided fighting directly.) And neither Russia nor Ukraine is beseeching anyone to stop the war; the leaders of both countries think they can still gain an advantageUkraine by pummeling the Russian army on the battlefield, Russia by pummeling Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles.\n\nNonetheless, Kissinger goes on:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have repeatedly expressed my support for the allied military effort to thwart Russias aggression in Ukraine. But the time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are chin-scratching words, but they mean nothing. First, theres the evasive phrase \"the time is approaching,\" allowing Kissinger to keep arguing his case even if the time hasnt yet arrived several months from now. Second, the \"strategic changes\" he mentions are Ukraines emergence as a major nation and its de facto alliance with (if not quite membership in) NATO. OK, but it isnt at all clear how this improves the chances for peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut his main point comes with the next sentence, about integrating these changes \"into a new structure.\" Its complete gobbledygook, unless you read it with Kissingers dissertation in mind. Kissinger wants to be the new Metternich, who molds a new European order through the restoration of the old orders principles.\n\nHis peace planthe cease-fire, followed by Russias withdrawal from the territories taken after February, which would then be followed by negotiations over the land annexed or occupied in 2014is but a means to this end. He states the point plainly:\n\nThe goal of a peace process would be twofold: to confirm the freedom of Ukraine and to define a new international structure, especially for Central and Eastern Europe. Eventually Russia should find a place in such an order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis last sentence is a mind-blower. \"Eventually Russia should find a place in such an order\"? \"Eventually Russia should find a place in such an order\"? What is Kissinger talking about? Right now (when Kissinger posits that the time for diplomacy \"is approaching\"), the actual existing Russiapersonified in Putinhas no desire for a place in such an order. Putin disputes the existence, much less the freedom, of a Ukrainian nation. He dreams of restoring the Great Russian Empire of Peter the Great, not some Metternichian vision of Europe; a revived Congress of Vienna is not a part of his vocabulary, much less his agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKissinger seems not to realize this. \"For all its propensity to violence,\" he writes, \"Russia has made decisive contributions to the global equilibrium and to the balance of power for over half a millennium. Its historical role should not be degraded.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, too, is an astonishing statement. He is correct in dismissing the views of some that Russia should be reduced to impotence, even broken up into several smaller states, by this war. That would unleash several civil wars, which, given Russias nuclear arsenal, could turn catastrophic for the globe. Nonetheless, Russia has hardly been a consistent force for peace or stability in the past 500 years. Its genuinely \"decisive contributions to the global equilibrium\" came during the Cold War but at the expense of freedom and prosperity for hundreds of millions of people, including its own citizenry. More to the point, Putin is not interested in a balance of power nownot in one that contributes to equilibrium. The world he wants restored is one in which Russia dominates a vast stretch of the map, including all of Ukraine.\n\nKissinger concludes, \"The quest for peace and order has two components that are sometimes treated as contradictory: the pursuit of elements of security and the requirement for acts of reconciliation. If we cannot achieve both, we will not be able to reach either.\"\n\nHe is right. The problem is, Putin has an outlandish vision of security and no desire for reconciliation. That is the problem we face with this war. Kissingers peace plan does nothing to solve it.",

Jakub Szymczuk/Kprp\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine declared on Friday that Ukraine was \"working toward victory,\" buoyed by his heros welcome in Washington and a brief visit to Poland in a sprint of diplomacy aimed at thanking his countrys most robust allies and cementing their support.\n\nMr. Zelensky was back in Kyiv after his trip, which has boosted morale in a country where millions have been plunged into darkness and cold from Russian missile strikes that have knocked out power as winter sets in.\n\n\"I am in my office,\" he said in a video posted to his channel on the Telegram social media app early Friday. \"We are working toward victory.\"\n\nWestern allies have pumped aid into Ukraine since Russias invasion, and the United States House gave final approval later Friday to nearly $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Zelensky specifically thanked the Netherlands for a promise of 2.5 billion euros, or about $2.7 billion. \"We keep working together to increase defense capability, energy stability & restore critical infrastructure,\" he posted on Twitter.\n\nIn a brief evening address on Thursday while en route home, he expressed satisfaction with his landmark visit to Washington, insisting that it had heeded \"good results\" that \"will really help\" with Ukraines ongoing war effort.\n\nBefore returning to Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky stopped off in Poland, where he met for two hours with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, near the airport in the southeastern city of Rzeszow, a major transit point for Western weapons flowing into neighboring Ukraine and for refugees fleeing Ukraine into Poland.\n\nThe location of the meeting, held one day after Mr. Zelensky met Mr. Biden at the White House, was kept secret for security reasons. Video of his arrival at the Rzeszow airport showed Mr. Zelensky bounding down the steps of his plane dressed in green cargo pants, heavy boots and a military-style winter jacket.\n\nMr. Duda, in a message posted on Twitter, said that the two leaders had discussed \"strategic plans for actions and cooperation in the upcoming 2023,\" reaffirming Polands strong support for Ukraines efforts to defend itself against Russias military.\n\nToday's meeting with the President of Ukraine @ZelenskyyUa was not only a great opportunity to send Christmas and New Year wishes to him, his Family and Ukraine, but also gave me an opportunity to discuss strategic plans for actions and cooperation in the upcoming 2023. pic.twitter.com/CfKtkChmU1 Andrzej Duda (@AndrzejDuda) December 22, 2022\n\nAfter weeks of a stalemate along much of the front, Mr. Zelenskys high-profile visit to Washington was greeted in Ukraine mostly with pride and hope that the presidents impassioned in-person appeals would keep American weapons and financial support flowing.\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir V. Putins spokesman, said as the Kremlin has argued before that the trip showcased the United States commitment to fighting Russia \"to the last Ukrainian.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Zelenskys visit to Washington ended with promises of billions more in U.S. support, it did not fulfill some of the more critical requests on his weapons wish list: American battle tanks, fighter jets and long-range precision missiles.",

However, officials will be watching closely to see what figures inside the Kremlin say about it in the coming days.\n\nThousands have been killed, entire villages wiped out and billions of dollars of infrastructure destroyed since Putins invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.\n\nThat day, Putin used the term \"special military operation\" to describe his attack. He has framed the ongoing brutality as a campaign of \"denazification\" a description dismissed by historians and political observers and has increasingly described Russias unprovoked invasion as a patriotic and almost existential cause.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a briefing after the State Council meeting at the Kremlin on December 22, 2022 in Moscow.

But thats in their own mind and well always find the antidote.\n\n\"So those doing it are just wasting their time, its just delaying the conflict.\"\n\nIn his address to Congress, Zelensky briefly discussed a 10-point peace formula and summit that he told Biden about during an earlier meeting at the White House. The Ukrainian leader claimed Biden supported the peace initiatives.\n\nAsked Thursday by a reporter whether there was a real chance of diplomacy in Ukraine, Putin said that negotiation always preceded the end of conflict.\n\n\"All conflicts, armed conflicts too, end one way or another with some kind of negotiations,\" Putin said as he accused Zelensky of refusing to negotiate.\n\n\"We never refused, it was the Ukrainian leadership that refused itself to conduct negotiations sooner or later any party to the conflict will sit down and negotiate and the sooner those opposing us realize it, the better,\" he said.\n\n\"We have never given up on it.\"\n\nPutin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Wednesday declared the Kremlin would make a substantial investment in many areas of the military. The initiatives include increasing the size of the armed forces, accelerating weapons programs and deploying a new generation of hypersonic missiles to prepare Russia for what Putin called \"inevitable clashes\" with its adversaries.",

Ukraine is alive and kicking.\"\n\nBut alongside Zelenskys gratitude was a plea, emphasizing that his armed forces are outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military even as they fight on. At one point, Zelensky drew laughs from the chamber when he said, \"We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.\"\n\nZelenskys visit to Washington marks his first trip outside his homeland since it was invaded 300 days ago, arriving Wednesday afternoon to set a course for the future of the war alongside a key Western ally.\n\nOn \"the frontline of tyranny,\" Zelensky argued during his speech to Congress, American support \"is crucial not just to stand in such (a) fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"The world is too interconnected and too interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues,\" he added. \"Our two nations are allies in this battle and next year will be a turning point, I know it the point where Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.\"\n\n\"Your money is not charity,\" he asserted to Congress. \"Its an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.\" Zelensky also called on lawmakers to strengthen sanctions against Russia.\n\nStill, despite that disparity in resources, Zelensky said, \"Ukraine holds its line and will never surrender.\"\n\nIn his speech, Zelensky harkened back to American history, referencing the Battle of the Bulge, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Battle of Saratoga. Just like \"brave American soldiers which held their lines\" and fought against Adolf Hitlers Nazi Germany in 1944, Ukrainian soldiers \"are doing the same to Putins forces this Christmas,\" Zelensky said.\n\nHe also briefly discussed a 10-point peace formula and summit that he told US President Joe Biden about during an earlier meeting at the White House. Zelensky claimed Biden supported the peace initiatives.\n\nZelensky also recalled his recent visit to the frontlines Bakhmut in Donbas which has been under siege since May. There, he said, \"every inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour.\" In the climatic moment of the speech, he unveiled a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting in Bakhmut that he gave as a gift to the Congress.\n\n\"The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever have. Its true, but our defense forces stand,\" he added.\n\nRussia, Zelensky argued in strong terms, has \"found an ally\" in Iran.\n\n\"Irans deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other,\" he said. \"It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now.\"\n\nZelenskys White House visit\n\nEarlier Wednesday the Ukrainian leader visited the White House, where he met with Biden and held a joint news conference, during which the duo displayed a united front on their approach to the war.\n\n\"I think we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous and secure Ukraine is the vision we both want this war to end,\" Biden told reporters in the White House East Room.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden relayed that he felt it was \"particularly meaningful\" to speak to Zelensky in person and \"look each other in the eye.\" The Ukrainian presidents leadership, Biden said, has inspired the world.\n\n\"We understand in our bones that Ukraines fight is part of something much bigger,\" Biden continued.\n\nBiden said Zelensky has shown his \"strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats,\" and said the US was standing alongside Ukraine in maintaining \"core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\nBoth Biden and Zelensky addressed the Russians during the news conference, with the Ukranian president repeatedly calling Russian forces \"terrorists\" and Biden underscoring the importance of being \"clear\" about Russias actions.\n\n\"It is purposely attacking Ukraine critical infrastructure, destroying the system to provide heat and light (to) Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another,\" Biden said. The war, Biden later argued, \"could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just pulled out. But thats not gonna happen.\"\n\nBut the two leaders, it seems, still have different perspectives on their approach to pursuing peace with Russia.\n\nEarly in the news conference, Biden said Zelensky was open to pursuing a \"just peace.\" Later, when asked by a reporter to share his idea of a fair way to end the war, the Ukrainian leader responded, \"For me, as a president, just peace is no compromises as to the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of my country, the payback for all the damages inflicted by Russian aggression.\"\n\n\"There cant be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us by these inhumans, I would say,\" he added.\n\nMeeting comes at a critical moment\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Congress as Rep.

NA/Ukrainian Presidency In pictures: Zelensky's wartime visit to US Prev Next\n\nZelensky arrived to the South Lawn just after 2 p.m. ET, eschewing a suit for his now-familiar military green shirt. A military honor guard lined the White House driveway as his black vehicle pulled toward the building.\n\n\"I understand that we have very important topics and well discuss them, everything, so many challenges in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world, from energy to the situation on the battlefield,\" Zelensky said in the Oval Office. \"But first of all, really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians, from our nation.\"\n\nThe wartime visit was meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Bidens ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested.\n\nIt has also been an opportunity for Biden and top American officials to sound out Zelensky on how he views the trajectory of the conflict, and to offer their thoughts on what it would take to bring the war to an end.\n\n\"Together with our partners, were also going to impose costs on the Kremlin and will support Ukraine in pursuing a just peace,\" Biden said in the Oval Office, a reference to how Zelensky has said he hopes to see the war end. \"President Zelensky, the United States stands with the brave people in Ukraine.\"\n\nSitting before a roaring fireplace, Zelensky offered Biden a military cross medal from a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front lines.\n\n\"He said, Give it to a very brave president,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\"Undeserved but much appreciated,\" Biden replied as he accepted the medal, asking if it would be possible to contact the Ukrainian soldier.\n\nA surprise visit\n\nThe trip, which US and Ukrainian officials arranged in secret over the past week, came with heavy risks. After arriving in Poland by train, Zelensky flew to Washington aboard an American military aircraft, US officials said. He arrived in the US shortly after midday at Joint Base Andrews, just outside the nations capital.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meet in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC on December 21, 2022. - Zelensky is in Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and address Congress -- his first trip abroad since Russia invaded in February. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden first discussed the prospect of Zelensky visiting Washington during a telephone call with the Ukrainian leader on December 11, an administration official said. A formal invitation was extended a week ago that Zelensky accepted, launching joint consultations on the security parameters of the risky, highly secretive trip.\n\nZelensky, who the official said was \"very keen\" to visit the US, determined those parameters met his needs, and the US set to work executing them. The trip was finally confirmed on Sunday.\n\nTight security was enforced around Zelenskys visit amid concerns that Russia wants to incapacitate the Ukrainian president, a source close to the Ukrainian leader told CNN on Wednesday. Because of this ongoing threat, senior top government officials as well as embassy staff in the US were not informed about the schedule of the visit.\n\nAccording to the source, the military risk had to be calculated allowing the Ukrainian president to make the short overseas trip without jeopardizing the military situation. Scheduling also had to be worked with the White House to assess availability for this to happen.\n\nIn weighing a visit, Zelensky suggested he did not want to travel had there not been a significant development in the bilateral relationship between Ukraine and the US. Zelensky viewed the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies.\n\nThe new, $1.8 billion package Biden unveiled includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraines to fend of Russian air attacks. CNN was first to report the US was expected to send the Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nDuring the news conference, Biden told CNNs Phil Mattingly that the missile system is defensive, not escalatory. Zelensky said the system is \"something that will strengthen our air defense significantly.\"\n\n\"Every dollar of this investment for the United States is going to be a strengthening of global security and I know that the American leadership will be strong and will play important role in global scope,\" Zelensky added.\n\nHe also suggested Ukraine would want more of the systems.",

But by hosting him at the White House, President Biden will signal that Washington is committed to supporting the country for \"as long as it takes\", as has been repeatedly said.\n\nIn a speech to defence chiefs on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country was fighting against Nato forces in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's well known that the military potential and capabilities of almost all Nato's main countries is being actively used against Russia.\"\n\nIn its briefing ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit, the White House confirmed a new package of nearly $2bn of security assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThat includes a new Patriot missile system - a sophisticated air defence system that will help Ukraine to protect its cities from missiles and drones that Russia has fired at critical facilities.\n\nThe attacks, which officials here say are designed to break Ukrainian morale, have left millions without electricity and heating as temperatures across the country plummet below freezing.\n\nPresident Zelensky, however, is unlikely to receive the longer-range weapons he's been calling for, to hit Russian targets away from the front lines.\n\nIn his address to Congress on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader will probably use the infrastructure strikes to plead for more weapons. There, he will find some Republicans who have voiced criticism about the level of US support, as Congress considers approving an extra $50bn in aid.\n\nThe monthly cost of defence for Ukraine is reportedly about $5bn (4.1bn).\n\nThe visit to Washington comes a day after President Zelensky, dressed in combat khaki, was in Bakhmut, a front-line city in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the fiercest battles in this war.\n\nHe met troops and handed out awards to soldiers, the presidency said.\n\nThe visit was a significant show of defiance - and a demonstration of support for Ukrainian forces on the front line.\n\nSoldiers gave Mr Zelensky a Ukrainian flag with their names signed on it and asked him to give it to President Biden and the US Congress, in a moment that was captured on camera.\n\nPresident Zelensky has vowed to take back all territory that's under occupation, including areas invaded before February. Before the visit, in his traditional evening address, he said Ukraine would do \"everything possible and impossible, expected and unexpected\" to get \"the results that all Ukrainians expect\".\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the US military estimates that at least 100,000 Russian and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured, along with some 40,000 civilian deaths.",

I was just on the the video with our G7 partners this morning. And this is one of the things that we talked about,\" Blinken told CNNs Kylie Atwood.\n\nBlinken called Zelenskys peace proposals \"a good start.\"\n\n\"Theyre things that everyone should be able to, in one way or another, to rally to,\" he said.\n\nBlinken would not say how long it would take for the US and Ukraine to evaluate the plan together. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the two sides agreed to reviewing the plan yesterday in the meeting between US President Joe Biden and Zelensky.\n\nWhat borders would Ukraine accept in a peace deal? Blinken said the US and Ukraine agreed on the overall peace effort underway. He did not respond more directly to a question of whether Kyiv would accept a goal of reclaiming territory up to its borders before the Feb. 24 invasion. Blinken has previously said that's the US focus, while Zelensky has outlined broader visions for retaking the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014.\n\n\"Whats clear from all of our conversations with Ukraine, including the conversations just yesterday between President Biden and President Zelensky, is that we have the same objectives, the same goals: a free and independent, a prosperous, a democratic Ukraine, one that demonstrates that the principles of the United Nations charter are being upheld, including on territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence, and thats something the president reiterated yesterday,\" Blinken said.\n\nBlinken said Ukraine has told the US that it is currently focused on taking back its eastern and southern territory that has been occupied since February.\n\n\"But that doesnt prejudge in any way where this goes, where it settles,\" said Blinken at his year-end news conference, emphasizing that it would be up to Ukraine to decide what a \"just and durable\" peace looks like.\n\nBlinken also reiterated that Russia has shown \"no meaningful interest\" in diplomacy to end the war.\n\nFor his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that his administration has always been open to talks and that \"it was the Ukrainian leadership that refused itself to conduct negotiations.\"",

                "cc_text": "In November 2022, General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent shock waves through Western capitals when he declared that the war in Ukraine is unwinnable by purely military means. Milley suggested that Ukraine is now in a position of strength and that this winter might be the moment to consider peace talks with Russia. He also recalled World War I, when the adversaries refusal to negotiate led to millions of additional deaths, suggesting that failure to \"seize\" the moment could lead to greatly more human suffering. His remarks challenged not only the position of Kyiv but also that of many of its Western backers, including Poland, the Baltics, North America, and the United Kingdom, which have endorsed Ukraines pursuit of complete military victory. As Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas argues in Foreign Affairs, \"The only path to peace is to push Russia out of Ukraine.\" Russias defeat, Ukrainian membership in NATO, the trial of Russias political and military leadership for war crimes, the payment of damagesthese are essential to peace, she concludes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys ten-point peace plan unveiled in November takes the same approach.\n\nIf Milleys comments were controversial, however, they pointed to a larger problem with seeking complete victory. Complete victory could require a very long war, and it would also mean that its ultimate duration would depend on political factors beyond the Wests control. For those calling for complete victory, the West must simply keep supplying Ukraine with the weapons and resources it needs to continue fighting, and wait for Russia to lose and, ideally, for Putin to go.\n\nBut a grinding war of attrition has already been hugely damaging for Ukraine and the West, as well as for Russia. Over six million Ukrainians have been forced to flee, the Ukrainian economy is in freefall, and the widespread destruction of the countrys energy infrastructure threatens a humanitarian catastrophe this winter. Even now, Kyiv is on financial life support, maintaining its operations only through billions of dollars of aid from the United States and Europe. The costs of energy in Europe have risen dramatically because of the disruption of usual oil and gas flows. Meanwhile, despite significant setbacks, Russian forces have regrouped and have not collapsed. The best plausible outcome for Ukraine would be the retreat of Russian forces to the lines of control that existed before the February 2022 invasion. But even if the Russians are swept back to the status quo ante, many Ukrainians fear that Moscow will simply retrench and regroup, waiting for the next opportunity to invade. It is by no means clear that military deterrence would be enough to secure the resulting peace.\n\nWhat is missing, then, is a coherent political plan to bring an end to the suffering, and to reassure Ukrainians that Russia will not begin a new war at the earliest opportunity, even if Putin remains in power. That will require the Russians to accept a defeat but also require the Ukrainians to accept that complete victory may be unobtainable. But if those goals are to be achieved, Western populations will need to accept the end of Russias pariah status and its \"return to Europe\" while providing credible security assurances to Kyiv. In other words, the West must formulate a major policy vision that obviates the desire of Ukraine and its staunchest supporters to have Russia smashed and neutralized. If the United States and its partners fail to lay out such a plan, the chances for Milleys scenario will grow: a war of attrition, the danger of escalation and catastrophe, and a troubled aftermath to the war.\n\nRUSSIAN RESILIENCE\n\nAlthough it lacks the broad and deep support that Ukraine has received from its partners and allies, Russia is stronger than many would have predicted. Its army, economy, and leader all seem stable. Though the Russian military has been dispirited by repeated defeats, it has survived. The coming winter will be a crucial test for the Russian armys ability to endure, but military experts do not predict its collapse. Many more defeats and retreats would be needed to change this assessment.\n\nThe same is true of Russias economy. Many confidently predicted that Russian trade and industry would be crushed by the weight of sanctions imposed by Western governments. Such extreme economic pressure, it was suggested, could be sufficient to force Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine. But economic pressure is rarely enough to end a war. Russias economy has shrunk in 2022, but by just three percent, significantly less than some had predicted, and its financial system has proved sustainable and macroeconomically stable. Russia is cut off from many Western supply chains, but it has an extremely large current account surplus, which allows the countrys companies and government to find much of what they need elsewhere. During the Cold War, sanctions did not force Moscow to withdraw from Eastern Europe, and today they are unlikely to force Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. The price cap on Russian oil set by the G-7 in early December may hit Russias import revenues, but even Western optimists are uncertain how effective it will be. If, despite Western pressure, Russias war machine remains funded and equipped, the result will be a bloody stalemate.\n\nAs the main architect of this war, Putin is also aware of the potential consequences of defeat. His misreading of the history of Ukraine and Russia led him to assume that his invasion would experience quick success. But although Putin may misunderstand the origins of the Ukrainian nation, his grasp of the important lessons of the twin collapses of the Russian and Soviet states is strong. The Russian Empire fell in 1917 when its ruler, Tsar Nicholas II, abdicated. The Soviet state collapsed after President Mikhail Gorbachevs military and security leaders betrayed him and he lost control of the capital. Putin has made sure that he remains in firm control of the military, the security services, and the Russian population. The capital is calm and well fed, and the Kremlin has ensured that no army of unhappy conscripts is stationed nearby, as was the case in March 1917. Those who might have led a revolution have instead fled abroad, while rebellions in Dagestan or Buryatiapoor and remote areas in the Caucasus and Siberia, respectivelycould be managed.\n\nFor the moment, a majority of Russians continue to support the Russian government and are not ready to accept defeat. Many regard Crimea and its stronghold of Sevastopol as worth fighting for. And for many, Putin remains the guarantor of Russian sovereignty and stability. To elite and even many ordinary Russians, the outcome that the Ukrainians and their backers dream ofthe defeat of the Russian army and the downfall of Putinis a political nightmare, threatening economic chaos and lawlessness.\n\nOrdinary Russians have accepted their governments explanation that Western sanctions were imposed to crush the Russian people.\n\nGiven this complicated dynamic within Russia, it is unlikely that military defeats can be enough to make the Kremlin sue for peace. But the Wests current approach to simply let the war continue, though morally satisfying and politically popular, is risky. It subjects Ukrainians to the continual horrors of conflict. The death toll and financial cost of fighting will continue to rise. It feeds Putins narrative that Russia is in an existential battle with the West, and it encourages Russian nationalists belief that Russia must either win or perish. Western denunciations of Russias war crimes will not be enough to change Russian minds. Although increasing numbers of Russians no longer trust their own government and media, they do not trust their Western counterparts, either.\n\nToday, those Russian elites who mistrust the West's intentions as well as Putins may regard the prospect of peace as worse than the continuation of the war. Ordinary Russians may well agree: they have accepted their governments explanation that Western sanctions were imposed to crush the Russian people. Western commentators have given fuel to this view by arguing that the Russians must be punished for what their country has done to Ukraine. Those Russians with access to the Western media on the Internet do not accept that Russia is a \"terrorist state\" or an \"imperialist nation.\" Russian elites and many ordinary Russians believe that it is in their best interests to rally around the flag.\n\nOf course, political change in an autocratic system can be quick and complete. The power of Russias aging dictator rests on sowing and maintaining fear, apathy, cynicism, and mistrust among the countrys elites. With more Russian defeats, and further mobilization, millions of Russians may begin to blame Putin, just as their predecessors blamed Tsar Nicholas and Gorbachev. Combined with a crisis of morale, apathy, and exhaustion among the troops, such a shift in public opinion could generate a political crisis. It would be the moment when Russian political elites would have to decide whether to compromise with the West or fight to the end.\n\nMAP AND CARROTS\n\nIn November 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilsons Fourteen Points convinced Germanys leadership that they would be fairly dealt with and persuaded them to accept an armistice. This compromise ended World War I. The weakness of the German army and its leaders' realization that Germany had lost the war increased the attractiveness of Wilson's proposals. Rather than allow the remnants of their forces to be annihilated and their country invaded, they accepted Wilsons terms that promised not to punish Germany. This is the approach that the West must follow today. The West must be prepared to offer a map for the Russian elites and general population, outlining how they can end their isolation, free themselves of sanctions, and remove their pariah status.\n\nThis map should begin by explaining the risks of continuing the war. It should make clear that Russia cannot win. Ukraines Western-supplied military equipment is superior and its forces are determined. If Moscow keeps fighting, it will therefore sustain more defeats and casualties and place itself in increasing danger of calamitous and violent collapse. Russias future, the plan must gently explain, will be one of economic degradation; it risks becoming a weakened dependent of China. By accepting that it must end the war, the Russian government will spare itself the humiliation of a larger unraveling.\n\nThen the map must outline the gains that Russia will make if it chooses the path of de-escalation. Specific content will have to be determined through discussion, but some elements are obvious. First, a pledge that Russias sovereignty and integrity will be respected after a peace settlement with Ukraine. As unlikely as it may sound today, a framework, other than NATO, should be convened to ensure Russias place in Europes security architecture. Revisiting Gorbachevs vision of \"a common European home,\" marked by rapprochement rather than deterrence, and dismissed by both the West and Russia today, is a necessity. Second, the map must affirm that Western governments will recognize and respect Russias leadership, provided that Moscow rigorously obeys the UN Charter and international law, as well as honors Russias international treaties, agreements, and commitments. Third, the West should lay out a timetable for returning Russias frozen financial assets after demands for demilitarization and withdrawal are met. Finally, the map must declare that, after the end of the war, all international economic obstacles will be removed.\n\nUntil now, the West has used only sticks to coerce Russia to stop the war. The map must include some carrots, as well. The road to a peaceful settlement should be linked to a gradual lifting of sanctions. But perhaps the biggest carrot is international legitimacy. The West will have to grant international recognition to some people and groups that constitute part of todays regime. The Russian side at future peace talks will not consist of democrats, antiwar activists, and leaders in exile. Members of the military and the Russian bureaucracy will inevitably sit at the negotiating table. Providing at least some Russian leaders, who will opt for peace, with a choice between The Hague tribunal and the chance to take part in the creation of a new peaceful Russia would be a powerful stimulus for the road to peace and an end to the war.\n\nSELLING PEACE\n\nA vision for a postwar Russia should be aligned with a Western vision of a postwar Ukraine, without diluting the boundary between an aggressor and a victim. Though Western populations will take some convincing, it will be far more difficult to persuade Ukraine to agree on the map and the carrots for Russia. Zelenskys plan focuses on justice and retribution for Ukraine; it is all about coercing Russia to comply. Ukraine and its eastern allies do not want to let Russia off the hook, and they are opposed to any security guarantees to Moscow. They will demand that peace terms be announced only after Russia accepts its defeat, and perhaps even after Putin is gone. The U.S. government and other Western powers must explain that such an absolute approach will prolong the fighting and Ukraines own suffering. Publicizing a map toward negotiations now, while Putin continues his barbaric war and millions of Ukrainians suffer, does not constitute appeasement of Russia or condone Moscows aggression. On the contrary, it would be a prudent, strategic, and realist political move by the West and Ukraine to address the large and growing number of Russians who would prefer peace but abhor a choice between war and defeat.\n\nCrimea is a problem. Ukrainians are determined to recapture the peninsula, which they regard, justifiably, as stolen Ukrainian territory and a beachhead for Russian aggression. The West, however, has serious reasons to fear that Putin would do whatever it takes to prevent the fall of Crimea. The peninsula is the greatest obstacle to any talks between Moscow and Kyiv. An explicit Western demand to return Crimea as a precondition for peace talks will only rally more Russians to the side of war. Sometimes it is a wise strategy to leave an intractable subject for future negotiations.\n\nThe longer this war continues, the worse its consequences. World War I toppled great empires and dynasties across Europe, sowed the seeds of World War II, and led directly to the rise of Mussolini and Hitler. Historic feuds between Germany and France over Alsace-Lorraine, and between Serbia and Croatia over Bosnia, led to lethal consequences for both sides. The wounds of these conflicts took generations to heal.\n\nThe long-term effects of the war in Ukraine cannot be predicted with any certainty. But an awareness of the destabilizing effects of long and highly destructive wars should prompt reflection of the need for a more comprehensive strategy, one that can offer Ukraine its security and Russia its future. Rather than waiting to react to Moscow and Kyivs latest actions or hoping for Putins imminent downfall, the West must take the initiative at last.",

But it is increasingly clear that both sides demands even to start talks are flatly unacceptable to the other, leading American and European officials to conclude that serious discussions on ending the war are unlikely in the near future.\n\nThere have been no peace talks between Ukraine and Russia since the early weeks of the conflict, which began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24. This week, Ukraines foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, detailed a proposal for a \"peace\" summit by the end of February, but told The Associated Press that Kyiv would negotiate with Moscow only if Russia first faced a war-crimes tribunal.\n\nRussias foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, responded that Kyiv would have to accept Moscows demands including giving up the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow claimed to have annexed in September or else \"the Russian Army will deal with this issue.\"\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Wednesday that \"there cannot be a peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account todays realities with Russian territory,\" including the four annexed regions, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nStella Ghervas, a professor of Russian history at Newcastle University in Britain, said that \"the Ukrainian proposal offers a glimpse at Ukraines vision of how the war with Russia could one day end.\" But, she said, \"Lavrovs reaction is not very promising, and its an indicator that a peace negotiation could be months and months away.\"\n\nThe hard-line positions suggest that both sides believe they have more to gain militarily. Ukraine holds the battlefield momentum, having retaken much of the land that Russia captured early in the war, although Moscows forces still occupy large chunks of the east and south. And Russia is pressing its own advantage, readying more troops and launching aerial attacks on infrastructure that have deepened Ukrainians misery even as Russias army struggles on the ground.\n\nLast month, addressing a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 nations, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine presented a wide-ranging 10-point peace plan that called for the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern area known as the Donbas that Russian forces seized beginning in 2014.\n\nIt also demands an international tribunal to try Russian war crimes; Moscows release of all political prisoners and those forcibly deported during the war; compensation from Russia for war damages; and steps by the international community to ensure the safety of Ukraines nuclear power plants and provide for its food and energy security.\n\nIt is a much tougher set of requirements than Ukrainian negotiators initially offered at talks in Istanbul a month after Russias invasion, when they proposed adopting neutral status in effect abandoning a bid to join NATO, which Russia has long opposed in exchange for security guarantees from other nations. Russian atrocities have multiplied since then, and the damage to Ukraines cities and its economy has deepened. In August, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said that the framework proposed in Istanbul was no longer viable.\n\n\"The emotional background in Ukraine has changed very, very much,\" he told the BBC. \"We have seen too many war crimes live.\"\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said over the weekend that he was prepared to negotiate over \"acceptable outcomes,\" without specifying what those might be, while making clear that he had no intention of ending his attacks.\n\nWestern officials have dismissed Mr. Putins periodic offers to negotiate as empty gestures. Even as Russias economy shrinks under Western sanctions Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Wednesday that the Russian economy had contracted by 2 percent over the past 11 months Mr. Putin has emphasized that there are \"no limits\" to Russias military spending. This month, his defense minister ordered another expansion of the armed services by more than 300,000 members, to a target size of 1.5 million.\n\nAll of that suggests, said Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and Eastern European politics at the University of Oxford, that \"there is not necessarily a push for a negotiated peace or even some sort of negotiations, but still a push for whatever endgame is being sought militarily.\"",

                "cc_text": "Illustration: Liu Rui/GT\n\nThe recent trip of Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky to Washington is significant in a couple of ways. It is worth mentioning that the destination of Zelensky's first trip abroad since the beginning of the conflict is the geographically remote US, rather than nearby Brussels or Berlin. This is a clear sign that in Kiev they count on the US, rather than on Europe, as their most important strategic partner and the leading champion of the Ukrainian cause.Second, the trip is an indicator that at this point the Biden administration is not willing to change its overall approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The most intriguing outcome of the negotiations in Washington was the decision by the White House to provide Ukraine with the Patriot Air Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously delivered US air defense systems.The decision, however, should be regarded more as a symbolic political gesture rather than as a signal that the US military assistance to Ukraine is now raising to a new level. The Patriot system can hardly be considered a modern system - it is already in operation for almost four decades. It might be more efficient than any air defense weapon that Ukraine has now, but it is not going to be a game-changer in the conflict. Besides, it will take some time to deliver the Patriots, deploy them and properly train the Ukrainian military personnel how to operate them.Third, the trip and, especially, the Ukrainian president's address to the US Congress confirmed that there is a strong bipartisan consensus in Washington on the Ukrainian issue. In general, Republicans are no less supportive of Kiev than Democrats are. However, at least some Republicans, such as Kevin McCarthy, the likely new Speaker of the House, are going to raise specific questions regarding the US military, financial and economic assistance to Ukraine. In particular, they will call for more scrutiny and more transparency in assistance deliveries and they will insist on more rigid accounting procedures. Moreover, GOP leaders will not miss their chance to insist on changes in Ukraine related burden-sharing between the US and its European allies.It seems that the real problem of Zelensky is not to convince the US political establishment about the need to continue supporting Kiev, but rather to preserve the Ukrainian narrative in the focus of the US public. As the conflict goes on, this is becoming increasingly difficult, since many domestic US problems inevitably push Ukraine to the sidelines of the American public discourse. The recent midterm election was a visual manifestation of this challenge - in the election campaign, Ukraine did not make even to the ten top political issues. The Washington performance of Volodymir Zelensky, who is undoubtedly a PR pro, is apparently an attempt to prevent this routinization of the Ukrainian file from continuing.Zelensky and his team did everything they could to turn his trip into a dramatic performance. When the Ukrainian president visited the US capital last time back in September of 2021, he had been just another foreign leader with plummeting public support back home desperately looking for attention and recognition by the US establishment. In December of 2023 he has positioned himself as a war hero, a historic figure of the scale of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. He replaced his standard dark suit with an olive green battle fatigues and pullover. He was no longer clean shaven - his beard and his weariness were meant to demonstrate the immense physical and psychological pressure that he had been exposed to since the beginning of the conflict.Whether this powerful performance has a lasting impact on the US public opinion is yet to be seen. In any case, US military support will continue throughout 2023, and can even be increased in terms of supplying Kiev with more sophisticated and more advanced military hardware. Putting emotions aside, one has to accept that the conflict has already become existential not only for Ukraine and Russia, but for the US as well: the Biden administration cannot accept a defeat in Ukraine without facing major negative implications for the US positions all over the world.In sum, recent diplomatic activities around Ukraine imply that Russia, Ukraine, the US and the West at large are approaching 2023 with no immediate prospects not only for a comprehensive political settlement, and not even for a ceasefire. The conflicting sides count on their ability to prevail on the battlefield rather than on the skills that they can demonstrate their gains at the diplomatic table. One can only hope that this dire situation will not last for too long and that in the coming year peace will get a chance.The author is director general of the Russian International Affairs Council. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nThe US announced this week that it is providing a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine but experts say that while it will be a valuable addition to the beleaguered countrys air defense, its not a cure-all.\n\nThe US announced a new aid package to Ukraine on Tuesday, which included the \"first-ever transfer to Ukraine of the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems,\" according to a State Department spokesperson. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden.\n\n\"It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets,\" retired Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks previously told CNN of the systems capabilities.\n\nThe Patriots radar system combines \"surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,\" a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. The systems engagements with incoming aerial threats are \"nearly autonomous\" aside from needing a \"final launch decision\" from the humans operating it.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly asked for the US Armys Patriot an acronym for Phased Array Tracking Radar for intercept on Target system, as it is considered one of the most capable long-range air defense systems on the market. And though the US did not fulfill the request for the first 10 months of the war, a senior administration official told CNN that the \"reality of what is going on\" on the ground in Ukraine influenced their decision to do so.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Russian military has increasingly attacked Ukraines power grid and infrastructure as winter approached and the temperatures dropped. Zelensky told Biden that \"Russian missile terror\" had knocked out roughly half of Ukraines energy infrastructure.\n\nThose attacks have only further fueled Ukraines asks for the Patriot. In fact, the Army calls the Patriot system the services \"most advanced air defense system,\" which can intercept \"any aerial threat\" under \"any weather conditions.\"\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of US Army Europe, told CNN that there is likely some unrealistic expectations about what a Patriot battery will be able to do for Ukraine. It wont, for example, be available to use immediately after the US agrees to provide it it takes months to train troops on how to use the complex system, Hertling said, adding that training US troops to serve as maintainers or repairmen takes around a year. And it wont be able to provide blanket cover for the entire country.\n\n\"These systems dont pick up and move around the battlefield,\" Hertling said. \"You put them in place somewhere that defends your most strategic target, like a city, like Kyiv. If anyone thinks this is going to be a system that is spread across a 500-mile border between Ukraine and Russia, they just dont know how the system operates.\"\n\nIndeed, Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, told CNN that the Patriot is \"not a game-changer\" because it is \"still only able to defend a relatively small piece of dirt.\"\n\nNot to mention the significant logistical needs; just one battery is operated by roughly 90 soldiers, and includes computers, an engagement control system, a phased array radar, power generating equipment, and \"up to eight launchers,\" according to the Army.\n\nCSIS recently said in a report that the missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each. Rounds that expensive likely wont be used to shoot down every missile Russia launches toward Ukraine, Hertling said.\n\n\"This is not a system that will go after drones or smaller ballistic missiles,\" he said. \"Can it do that? Absolutely. But when youre talking about knocking down a $20,000 drone, or a $100,000 ballistic missile that Russia buys, with a $3-5 million rocket, that doesnt give you much of a return on the investment. What it can do it free up the low and medium systems to go after those kind of targets.\"\n\nThe system has been purchased by other US allies, including Israel, Germany, and Japan, and was sent to Poland in an effort to help them defend themselves against Russia as it invaded Ukraine on its border. The US military made clear in March when the Patriot system was sent to Poland that it was purely for defensive purposes of NATO territory and \"will in no way support any offensive operations.\"\n\nAnd in Ukraines case, Hertling says offensive operations are far more important than the Patriot system. CNN first reported last month that the US was considering a dramatic increase in the training provided to Ukrainian forces by instructing as many as 2,500 troops a month at a US base in Germany. The Pentagon said this month that combined arms training of battalion-sized elements, which will include infantry maneuvers and live fire exercises, would begin in January.\n\n\"The Patriots are a defensive, anti-ballistic and anti-aircraft weapon system, with the emphasis on defensive,\" Hertling said. \"You dont win wars with defensive capabilities. You win wars with offensive capabilities.\"",

How will it help?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nThe U.S. will send a Patriot surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine to bolster its air defense capabilities, a move that represents one of the most advanced defense systems that the Americans have so far provided to support Ukraine since Russia invaded last winter.\n\nThe transfer is part of a $1.85 billion package of new military assistance to Ukraine announced amid a months-long Russian assault on the country's critical infrastructure as the long, cold winter season sets in.\n\n\"Over the past three hundred days, the Kremlin has tried and failed to wipe Ukraine off the map. Now, Russia is trying to weaponize winter by freezing and starving Ukrainian civilians and forcing families from their homes,\" said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement announcing the aid package.\n\n\"In response, President Biden will announce today that the United States is providing critical new and additional military capabilities to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia's ongoing brutal and unprovoked assault,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement was made on a day that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington, D.C. his first trip outside of Ukraine since the war began to plead for additional air defense capabilities as Russian strikes have repeatedly disrupted power and water supply across his country.\n\n\"It becomes a real humanitarian issue when you're trying to deprive an entire country of its electrical grid and water and everything else,\" said Jeffrey Edmonds, a 22-year Army veteran who now works as a Russia analyst at the Center for a New American Security. \"I think they see that as a necessary step to help Ukrainians sustain themselves in the fight.\"\n\nWhat is a Patriot missile system?\n\nPatriot arrays are used around the world by the U.S. Army and about a dozen U.S. allies. It was originally designed as an anti-aircraft system, and newer variants are used primarily to engage ballistic missiles.\n\nThe U.S. will send a single Patriot battery to Ukraine, officials said.\n\nThe system has three primary components: a set of launchers, a control center and a sophisticated radar.\n\nDepending on which missiles are used and what is being targeted, a Patriot battery has a strike range of roughly 20 to 100 miles much too small to cover the entirety of Ukraine, which is about 800 miles from east to west and more than 500 miles from north to south.\n\n\"That will do a good job of defending maybe a single city, like Kyiv, against some threats. But it's not putting a bubble over Ukraine,\" said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nIn total, the value of the batteries and accompanying missiles could be about a billion dollars, Cancian estimated.\n\nUkrainian soldiers will need weeks, if not months, of training\n\nEarly in the conflict, U.S. officials had resisted the idea of sending a Patriot system to Ukraine.\n\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle was the question of manpower. About 90 positions are typically assigned to operate one missile battery. And the training needed is substantial; course lengths range from 13 weeks for a launching station operator to 53 weeks for a maintenance role, according to Army recruitment materials.\n\nUkrainian troops are expected to be trained in Germany by Americans. (Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers already travel to Germany each month for other weapons training. Pentagon officials had recently announced they would increase that number early next year.)\n\nEven on a compressed schedule, the training requirements mean that the Patriot system is unlikely to be operational until late winter or early spring, perhaps in February or March.\n\nThe push to get the system up and running as soon as possible could backfire, Cancian said: Ineffective operation caused by hasty training could hamper the system's effectiveness; in a worst case scenario, Ukrainians might be unable to prevent Russians from destroying it. That in turn could damage the political will to send future assistance to Ukraine, he said.\n\n\"If the Ukrainians had a year or two to assimilate the system, that wouldn't be any problem. The problem is they don't have a year or two. They want to do this in a couple weeks,\" Cancian said.\n\nWhat role the Patriot system could play in the conflict\n\nOver nearly 10 months of conflict, Ukraine has proved successful at keeping Russia from achieving air superiority over its airspace denying the Russians key firepower and intelligence capabilities.\n\nUnder near constant barrage by Russia, Ukraine manages to knock out the bulk of incoming missiles and drones. But stockpiles are dwindling for the defense systems that Ukraine has relied on through this point, analysts said.\n\nSoviet-era S-300 missile systems have been key for Ukraine, but its missiles are difficult to source. The U.S. has regularly delivered air defense assistance, including more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and eight ground-based air missile defense systems called NASAMS. The U.S. has also supplied dozens of mobile rocket launchers called HIMARS, in addition to an array of other military vehicles and arms including Javelin anti-tank missiles, helicopters, howitzers and drones. But those supplies, too, are running low.\n\nThe recent Russian airstrike barrages and ongoing assault on Ukraine's critical infrastructure have turned up pressure on the U.S. and its allies to do more.\n\nZelenskyy had renewed those calls in recent weeks ahead of Wednesday's visit to Washington, including in a phone call to Biden earlier this month. Last week, the Ukrainian leader had pressed the G7 for more assistance; in a statement afterward, the group announced it would set \"an immediate focus on providing Ukraine with air defense systems and capabilities.\"\n\nIn addition to the Patriot battery, the new aid package announced Wednesday also includes additional HIMARS ammunition, mortars, artillery rounds and tens of thousands of GRAD rockets and tank ammunition.\n\nKelly Greico, a defense analyst at the Stimson Center, called the announcement \"a sign that there is a real deep concern\" among U.S. officials about Ukraine's air defense capability.\n\nA response to a new phase in the war\n\nThe Patriot system is one of the most expensive single aid transfers the U.S. has made to Ukraine this year.\n\nAt $4 million apiece, the PAC-3 missiles that accompany the Patriot are much more expensive than Stingers or the missiles launched by HIMARS. They are costly enough that Ukrainians must be judicious in how they are used, analysts said. \"You can't just let these things fly,\" said Cancian.\n\nBefore October, Ukrainian air defenses had focused on protecting frontline troops in the east and south, along with key government buildings and military sites in Kyiv and a handful of regional hubs.\n\nNow, Ukraine is trying to defend a power grid that reaches every part of the country. In other words, there are more sites to protect, said Edmonds, the Russia analyst at CNAS.\n\n\"If you have an Iranian Shahed uncrewed system heading toward critical infrastructure in Ukraine, it may very well be worth the cost of a Patriot missile to take it out,\" he said. \"Given the onslaught that Russia is conducting against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, the move makes sense to me.\"\n\nGreico of Stimson Center warned of the possibility that Russia is playing a game of attrition using the cheap Iranian drones to get Ukraine to burn through its expensive missiles before unleashing its air force.\n\n\"That's a terrible choice to face, between the natural urge to protect your civilians from these brutal attacks and trying to ensure that you have the long-term military wherewithal to continue to resist the Russian war effort,\" Greico said.\n\nAs the war nears the one-year mark, there has also been a steady escalation in the types of weaponry supplied to Ukraine. Retired Air Force Lt. General Dave Deptula welcomes the addition of the Patriot system, but says that more is required. \"Wars aren't won just with good defense,\" Deptula said, adding that it's time for the US to provide Ukraine with fighter aircraft, advanced precision munitions and longer-range surface to surface missiles.\n\n\"It's critical to get more powerful weaponry to Ukraine now to defeat Russia's forces,\" Deptula said, \"Not just keep them in a stalemate.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by NPR's Greg Myre in Kyiv.",

                "cc_text": "CNN\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are planning to meet at the White House on Wednesday, according to two sources familiar with the planning, in a Washington visit that is tentatively scheduled to include an address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nZelensky is already on his way to Washington, two separate sources said, for a visit that marks his first trip outside of Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February of this year.\n\nThe visit to the White House, which hasnt been finalized and has remained tightly held due to security concerns, will include a meeting with Biden and top administration officials and is planned to coincide with the administrations intent to send the country a new defense assistance package. Biden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during the expected visit, a significant boost in aid headlined by the Patriot missile systems within the package, a US official told CNN.\n\nThe new announcement will add to the nearly $20 billion in US security assistance provided to Ukraine since Russias invasion began, and will come at the same moment US lawmakers are considering a sweeping government spending measure that includes an additional $45 billion in emergency assistance to the country.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on a potential visit or Biden announcement or new security assistance announcements.\n\nLawmakers are also planning for Zelensky to visit Capitol Hill to speak on Wednesday evening, though sources say the visit hasnt been finalized as officials work through security preparations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldnt confirm reports Zelensky would be coming to the Capitol on Wednesday, saying, \"I dont know that thats going to happen.\"\n\n\"We dont know yet. We just dont know,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN if the invitation had been made to him, she said: \"No. Not until we know if he can come.\"\n\nA visit by the Ukrainian leader to Washington would amount to a significant moment 10 months since Russias war in Ukraine began. Zelensky has emerged as an international personification of Ukrainian resistance to the invasion and has spent much of the year asking nations for support.\n\nHes delivered those appeals virtually, beaming into international summits and global legislatures to make his case for more weapons and funding. He has remained inside his country for the duration of the war, a reflection both of his desire to rally his besieged country and the precarious security situation he would face outside Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of the war, Zelensky remained bunkered down in the capital Kyiv, often addressing the nation from undisclosed locations. More recently, hes traveled to some of the wars fronts, including on Tuesday when he visited the frontline city of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been locked in brutal battle there for months.\n\nZelensky met with soldiers and handed out awards, according to his office. Video posted by state TV showed the president clad in fatigues and a flak vest presenting awards to troops. Bakhmut has seen some of the most ferocious fighting in the whole of the country since Russian forces launched their siege on the city in earnest in May, turning it into ruins.\n\nPelosi has been making calls to members urging them to show up to the Capitol on Wednesday over fears the chamber would be empty ahead of the holiday recess, one member said. Pelosi asked for members to be in attendance Wednesday night \"for a very special focus on Democracy.\"\n\nThe expectation from members, per several sources, is Zelensky will address Congress on Wednesday. But the sources caution that this may not be final yet over security concerns.\n\nUkraine has been calling for the US to send the advanced long-range air defense system that is highly effective at intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles as it comes under a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks that have destroyed key infrastructure across the country.\n\nA Patriot missile battery would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country and officials say it will help secure airspace for NATO nations in eastern Europe. CNN first reported last week that the US was planning to send Patriot systems to Ukraine.\n\nIt is not clear how many missile launchers will be sent but a typical Patriot battery includes a radar set that detects and tracks targets, computers, power generating equipment, an engagement control station and up to eight launchers, each holding four ready-to-fire missiles.\n\nOnce the plans are finalized, the Patriots are expected to ship quickly in the coming days and Ukrainians will be trained to use them at a US Army base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, officials said.\n\nUkraine has been asking for the system for months but the logistical challenges of delivering it and operating it are immense. Despite those obstacles, \"the reality of what is going on the ground\" led the administration to make the decision, the senior administration official told CNN, noting the continuing intense Russian missile barrages.\n\nUnlike smaller air defense systems, Patriot missile batteries need much larger crews, requiring dozens of personnel to properly operate them. The training for Patriot missile batteries normally takes multiple months, a process the United States will now carry out under the pressure of near-daily aerial attacks from Russia.\n\nThe system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

But Russia's president earlier this month vowed to continue to batter Ukraine's infrastructure, saying criticism of Russia's strikes would not interfere with its \"combat missions\".\n\nParts of the Ukrainian capital remained without power and heating on Saturday, the city's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. But water supplies have now been fully restored in the city.\n\nPower has been restored in the country's second city of Kharkiv, authorities said, after it was left without electricity for hours following Friday's wave of strikes that targeted energy stations across the country.\n\nLocal officials said as many as nine power facilities were hit as Russian forces fired 76 missiles and carried out drone attacks.\n\nKharkiv's mayor said the city suffered \"colossal\" damage.\n\nOne resident, Anastaisa, told the BBC the strikes began on Friday morning.\n\n\"In a matter of minutes, the lights started blinking,\" the mother of a two-month-old child said.\n\n\"Just 10 seconds later, we were out of power, everything just went still and that's it.\"\n\nAn intensive care nurse in Kharkiv, called Vlad, told the BBC that the staff at his hospital continued to work during the strikes on the city, because they were used to such attacks.\n\nKherson prosecutor's office\n\nFriday's attack on Kherson was the third in as many days on the southern city, a month after Russian forces retreated\n\nDefence Ministry adviser Yuriy Sak told the BBC on Friday that Russia's frequent attacks meant that repairing the damage to electricity infrastructure was getting harder.\n\nElsewhere, in the city of Kryvyi Rih, four people have been confirmed killed after a residential building was hit -a 64-year-old woman, a 30-year-old couple and a one-year-old boy, whose body was found overnight. Another person died in Kherson, authorities said.\n\nThe alarm was raised across Ukraine on Friday and Commander-in-Chief General Valeriy Zaluzhny said air defences had intercepted 60 of the 76 missiles fired, most of them cruise missiles.\n\nKyiv city officials said about 40 missiles had been fired at the capital alone - one of the biggest barrages since Russia's 24 February invasion.\n\nThirty-seven were brought down by air defences, the officials added.\n\n\"It's very stressful, but now I'm used to this,\" said 42-year-old Oksana, who lives in the capital. \"I don't want our children to live through this, to be in basements, shelters, I don't want this for them.\"\n\nRussia's attacks also cut power in the north-eastern Sumy region that borders Russia, and also in the central cities of Poltava and Kremenchuk.\n\nRussia has launched more than 1,000 missiles and Iranian-made attack drones since the wave of strikes began on 10 October.\n\nThe UK's Ministry of Defence says there has been an \"uptick\" in Russia's campaign of long-range strikes against Ukraine's critical infrastructure in recent days.\n\nUN human rights commissioner Volker Turk warned Thursday that more attacks on power facilities could \"lead to a further serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation and spark more displacement\".\n\n\"I'm angry,\" said Yelyzaveta, 21. \"They [Russia] are destroying our lives. We are used to it now. The most important thing is that Russia isn't here.\"\n\nAnd Anastasia said that life was becoming more difficult as winter sets in.\n\n\"When it's daytime it is still OK, it is tolerable and I can manage the situation, but when it's dark outside, this is when my problems begin because I need to see clearly, to measure baby formula and also to attend to the baby - those are stressful,\" she said",

                "cc_text": "With the White House expected to announce the release of a Patriot battery for Ukraines use, there is once again a debate raging in Washington about what new equipment can, or should, be sent to Kyivs aid. In the following op-ed, John Hardie and Bradley Bowman argue that there is another capability the Biden administration should clear for Ukraines defense a fairly cheap weapon with a long-range to strike at Russian targets.\n\nThe Kremlin on Dec. 13 rejected a Ukrainian peace proposal that called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine, instead insisting that Kyiv should simply accept the \"new realities\" and cede its occupied territories to Moscow. Its a clear sign from Moscow: theyre not interested in this war ending anytime soon. To help Ukraine defeat Russias invasion and liberate its land and people, Washington needs to redouble efforts to provide Ukrainians with the weapons they need.\n\nOne way to do that, which is apparently now under consideration, is sending Kyiv the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB). This system, which integrates an existing munition and rocket at a relatively low cost, would enable the Ukrainian military to strike high-value Russian targets well beyond the range of current Western-supplied munitions. That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory. For this reason, the Pentagon should move without delay to provide Kyiv with the GLSDB.\n\nA joint project by Saab and Boeing, the GLSDB marries two affordable, combat-proven systems: the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, a 113 kg precision-guided munition that is relatively cheap at around $40,000 each, and the M26, a low-cost, formerly demilitarized rocket. The system could include a multi-purpose warhead tailored for fixed, hardened, low collateral damage, and moving targets.\n\nThe GLSDB would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian military targets up to 150 km away with an accuracy of around one meter. With integration, the GLSDB can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS rocket artillery systems already supplied to Ukraine by the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.\n\nBut it can also be fired by non-traditional launchers, such as from the back of an ordinary-looking truck or from a nondescript shipping container hidden in plain sight. That would make it more difficult for Russian forces to find and destroy the system. The non-traditional launcher also makes the system a low-cost option to augment HIMARS, which US industry is currently racing to produce in order to both replace US launchers sent to Ukraine and meet demand from allies.\n\nOne of the great advantages of the GLSDB is that the munition and rocket already exist in the US arsenal. Industry would only need to integrate the munition and rocket rather than undertaking the time-consuming process of establishing a new production line. Accordingly, depending on several factors, Ukraine could receive an initial delivery of two launchers and 24 weapons in as little as nine months after the Pentagon approves the plan. If industry and the Pentagon move with a sense of urgency and Congress provides assertive oversight, a decision now by the Department of Defense could see an estimated 750 GLSDBs and 12 launchers delivered to Ukraine by the end of 2024. That dramatic ramp up in production is possible because industry simply needs to integrate existing bombs and rockets rather than build new ones.\n\nThats the how. Heres the why: Providing the GLSDB would enhance Ukraines ability to weaken Russian forces by hitting high-value targets deep behind the front lines.\n\nUkraine has employed this strategy to great effect since it received its M142 and M270 systems over the summer, striking key bridges, ammunition and fuel depots, command-and-control nodes, and other high-value targets in Russias rear. This has helped Ukraine halt Russias advances and played a critical role in Ukraines successful counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts.\n\nBut whereas the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets provided for Ukraines M142 and M270 systems can hit targets from around 85 kilometers away, the GLSDB would enable the Ukrainian military to strike targets at almost double that range. For example, the key Russian logistics hub in Luhansk city and its environs, just out of reach of GMLRS, would be well within the GLSDBs range. The same goes for the critical rail hub in the Crimean city of Dzhankoi, which supplies Russias grouping in southern Ukraine. Nearby settlements house major vehicle parks ripe for targeting.\n\nIf Ukraine had the GLSDB, Russia would be forced to move its depots even farther back from the front line, making it more difficult for Russian logistics to provide combat units with sufficient ammunition and other supplies to hold back Ukrainian forces, let alone take ground themselves. Likewise, Ukraine could strike various airbases from which Russian aircraft provide close air support to Russian troops or launch missiles targeting Ukraines critical infrastructure. GLSDB would also help Kyiv target bases in Ukraine from which Russian forces are launching Iranian drones.\n\nIndeed, the best form of air and missile defense includes an offensive strike capability.\n\nThe GLSDB could fulfill some of the missions that would be assigned to ATACMS missiles, which are also fired by the M142 and M270 but have a 300-kilometer range. For months, Kyiv has pleaded for ATACMS. But the White House has refused, fearing that providing these missiles could invite further provocation from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis risk is overstated when it comes to ATACMS, and the Biden administration should not let similar fears deter it from sending the GLSDB. Thus far, Moscows reaction to the Wests provision of military aid to Kyiv has featured lots of bark but little bite. Western materiel has enabled Ukraine to stay in the fight and eventually retake large swathes of land, including Ukrainian territory Putin has cynically labeled as part of Russia.\n\nWhile Moscow has escalated attacks in Ukraine, the Kremlin has assiduously avoided attacking any NATO member, despite the Western weapons flowing into Ukraine. Theres little doubt why: Doing so would risk a direct conflict with the United States, something Putin appears keen to avoid, particularly when the bulk of his military is tied down in Ukraine and badly battered.\n\nAs an extra precaution, the Biden administration could condition its provision of the GLSDB on a Ukrainian commitment to use the system only against targets in occupied Ukrainian territory, including Crimea. Kyiv has honored a similar promise made with respect to HIMARS, and theres every reason to believe the Ukrainians would keep their word with the GLSDB.\n\nThe Kremlin wants Kyiv and the West to accept \"new realities\" in Ukraine following Russias unprovoked invasion. That would be a disaster, inviting more aggression in the future from authoritarian regimes seeking to bully beleaguered democracies and seize territory by force.\n\nIn Ukraine, the United States has a partner willing to fight for our shared interests and principles. They arent asking Americans to do the fighting for them. They are simply asking for the means to defend their homes.\n\nThe GLSDB would provide Ukraine with a powerful tool to advance US and Ukrainian interests. Every day the Pentagon delays its decision on the GLSDB is another day Ukraine will go without this valuable capability. There is no time to waste.\n\nJohn Hardie is deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), where Bradley Bowman is senior director of FDDs Center on Military and Political Power.",

                "cc_text": "On December 16, the Russian troops launched dozens of missiles at Ukraines capital in one of the wars worst attacks that caused massive power disruptions across the country. According to the British Intelligence update, there has recently been an uptick in long-range strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure.\n\nThe update stated that the waves of strikes launched on Ukraine have consisted mainly of air and maritime-launched cruise missiles but have almost certainly included the Iranian Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.\n\nWith Russia likely to acquire Iranian ballistic missiles, it could unleash mayhem over Ukraine since the embattled country does not have enough air defense systems to intercept and shoot down ballistic missiles.\n\nEurAsian Times had reported earlier this week that the United States was in the advanced stages of finalizing the delivery of Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine. The latest reports indicate that Washington is considering arming Kyiv with the most advanced system, the PAC-3 Patriot.\n\nThe Patriot PAC-3 is one of the options that the US government is now considering sending to Ukraine so that Kyiv can intercept ballistic missiles that hit its territory, Politico reported.\n\nAnother alternative for US defense officials is hiring Raytheon Technologies, a major player in the countrys defense sector, to develop new equipment. However, this may take years.\n\nRattled by the reports, the Russian embassy in the United States issued a statement saying that the potential sale of Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine would be another aggressive move by the Biden administration and might have \"unpredictable consequences.\" However, a decision hasnt been taken by the US yet.\n\nThe Patriots capability to shoot down ballistic missiles is unlikely to be disregarded by Russian military authorities. If Patriot systems were widely deployed in Ukraine, they could effectively block any ballistic missiles that Russia could employ to attack Ukrainian infrastructure.\n\nContrary to Russian ballistic missiles like the Iskander, which maneuver to avoid interception, Iranian-origin missiles like the Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar, which have ranges of 300 and 700 kilometers, respectively, follow a straightforward ballistic trajectory and would easily be shot down by the Patriot interceptor.\n\nOn top of that, the most advanced variant of the Patriot missile defense system would be considered an aggressive move due to its combat capability that could tilt the balance in Kyivs favor.\n\nCurrently, the PAC-3 has been exported only to a handful of countries, including Germany, Japan, Kuwait, Taiwan, and the Netherlands.\n\nCNN US Military analyst Major General James \"Spider\" Marks (Retd) told CNN, \"The employment of the Patriot, which is upgraded air defense ability, will address and mitigate the primary threat that Ukraine faces, i.e., the use of guided missiles and guided drones by Russia to hit sensitive targets inside Ukraine. The Patriot missile defense increases accuracy and kill rate and protects the ground to specific targets.\"\n\nThe analyst explained, \"Even the S-400 can do that, but the flexibility of the Patriot with the Phased Array radar gives great precision without having to reposition the radar. So now, the Russians would lose that advantage they have enjoyed over Ukraine, i.e., launching these attacks from their sanctuaries.\n\nTo overcome this, the Russians will have to position themselves closer to the Ukrainians; they get slaughtered every time they are close to them.\"\n\nPAC-3 Patriot Missile Defense System\n\nThe Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target (PATRIOT) Advanced Capability-Three (PAC-3) program is a missile-defense, guided missile system with long-range, medium- to high-altitude, all-weather capabilities. Its built to defend against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and cutting-edge aircraft.\n\nThe Patriot missile system fire unit, which houses the phased array radar set, engagement control station, battery command post, electric power plant, antenna mast group, communications relay group, and missile launchers, is used in combat.\n\nThe radar system performs tactical tasks such as airspace monitoring, target detection, identification, classification, and tracking as well as missile guidance and engagement assistance.\n\nThe main objective of PAC-3 is to counter threats from aircraft, sophisticated cruise missiles, and Tactical ballistic missiles (TBM). The PAC-3 missile employs hit-to-kill technology to increase its lethality against TBMs.\n\nImprovements brought forth by the PAC-3 system modifications have increased performance against changing threats, satiated user needs, and improved joint interoperability.\n\nThe US Armys top air defense system, Patriot, has quick response times, incredible firepower, the capacity to track several targets at once, and the ability to function in harsh conditions. The PAC-3 variant can intercept targets up to an altitude of up to 40 kilometers (130,000 ft).\n\nA Patriot battery typically contains six to eight truck-mounted launchers with four launch canisters, each of which can simultaneously hold up to four missiles.\n\nAccording to CSIS Missile Defense Project, a battery is manned by around 90 soldiers. It contains a radar for detecting and tracking targets, a control system, a high-frequency antenna mast, and power generators.\n\nThe general efficacy of the PAC-3 Patriot could be gauged by the fact that the Patriot missile systems use a single type of interceptor missile for drones, aircraft, and ballistic missiles. In contrast, Russian missile systems like the S-300, S-350, S-400, and S-500 employ multiple types of missiles, each tailored to engage a different target type.\n\nTo put things in perspective, the missile launched by the S-400 to take down a drone would not be able to take out a target that was flying very high.\n\nIn addition, some military experts consider any such transfer of PAC-3 to Ukraine more of a political move. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, \"This is a political gesture of support. What were sending, which I believe is one battery, will not protect Ukrainian cities plural. Its going to protect one spot somewhere. The defended area of what were sending will be rather limited.\"\n\nThe number and type of interceptors accompanying the battery are still to be determined. It is feasible that additional interceptors and similar equipment could originate from other nations, given the numerous worldwide operators of Patriot.\n\nThe PAC-3 missile defense is costly. The price of each PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE), the only kind that the US is currently buying, is around $4.1 million. PAC-2s are about half that price.\n\nThe US Army has recently purchased around 180 missiles in a year. In 2023, that number will rise to 252 missiles for $1.037 billion. On the other hand, Russia is deploying cheap UAVs and relatively cheaper ballistic missiles that it is set to acquire from Iran. The cost differential would be very high.\n\nTraining and sustainment pose another possible barrier. According to the Army PEO missiles and space spokeswoman, the Patriot training program at Fort Sill in Oklahoma takes US personnel nine months to complete.\n\nHowever, as the conflict becomes more intense by the day, with Russia getting more insecure and getting hold of ballistic missiles, the PAC-3 will likely fill a critical air defense gap in Ukraine.",

                "cc_text": "In a break with its post-World War II pacifist stance, Japan on Friday announced it would begin an unprecedented $320 billion military build-up that will include the capability of striking China and readiness for a sustained conflict.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida's government worries that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has set a precedent that will encourage China to attack Taiwan, threatening nearby Japanese islands, disrupting supplies of advanced semiconductors and putting a potential stranglehold on sea lanes that supply Middle East oil.\n\n\"This is setting a new heading for Japan. If appropriately executed, the Self-Defense Forces will be a real, world-class effective force,\" said Yoji Koda, a former Maritime Self-Defense Force admiral, who commanded the Japanese fleet in 2008.\n\nIn the sweeping five-year plan, once unthinkable in pacifist Japan, the government said it would also stockpile spare parts and other munitions, expand transport capacity and develop cyber warfare capabilities.\n\nIn its postwar, American-authored constitution, Japan gave up the right to wage war and the means to do so.\n\n\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a serious violation of laws that forbid the use of force and has shaken the foundations of the international order,\" the strategy paper said.\n\n\"The strategic challenge posed by China is the biggest Japan has ever faced,\" it added, also noting that Beijing had not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control.\n\nA separate national security strategy document that pointed to China, Russia and North Korea, promised close cooperation with the United States and other like-minded nations to deter threats to the established international order.\n\n\"The Prime Minister is making a clear, unambiguous strategic statement about Japan's role as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific,\" U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. \"He has put a capital \"D\" next to Japan's deterrence,\" he added.\n\nThe White House was also positive with the development. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the overhaul of Japan's defense policy will \"strengthen and modernize\" the country's military alliance with the United States.\n\n\"Japan's goal to significantly increase defense investments will ... strengthen and modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance,\" Sullivan said on Friday.\n\nChina blasts decision\n\nMeanwhile, a squadron of Chinese Navy ships sailed through straits near Japan into the Western Pacific this week, while Beijing on Friday blasted Tokyo's adoption of a new national security strategy putting itself on a more offensive footing largely as a result of the perceived threat from China.\n\nThe destroyers Lhasa and Kaifeng, and a replenishment ship, sailed through the Osumi Strait in southern Japan, while a Dongdiao-class surveillance ship with hull No. 796 sailed through the Miyako Strait south of Okinawa, all arriving in the Western Pacific by Thursday.\n\nJapan's Defense Ministry said the craft were closely shadowed by Japanese ships and planes throughout.\n\nThe Communist Party newspaper Global Times on Friday cited unidentified experts saying the mission \"sent a signal amid Japan's recent militaristic moves\" that will display the People's Liberation Army's \"capabilities in safeguarding China's national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests.\"\n\nUkraine Lesson\n\n\"The Ukraine war has shown us the necessity of being able to sustain a fight, and that is something Japan has not so far been prepared for,\" said Toshimichi Nagaiwa, a retired Air Self-Defense Force general. \"Japan is making a late start, it is like we are 200 meters behind in a 400-meter sprint,\" he added.\n\nChina's defense spending overtook Japan's at the turn of the century, and now has a military budget more than four times larger.\n\nKishida's plan will double defense outlays to about 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) over five years, blowing past a self-imposed 1% spending limit that has been in place since 1976.\n\nIt will increase the defense ministry's budget to around a tenth of all public spending at current levels and will make Japan the world's third-biggest military spender after the United States and China, based on current budgets.\n\nThat splurge will provide work to Japanese military equipment makers such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which is expected to lead the development of three of the longer-range missiles that will be part of Japan's new missile force.\n\nMHI will also build Japan's next jet fighter alongside BAE Systems PLC and Leonardo SPA in a joint project between Japan, Britain and Italy announced last week.\n\nTokyo allocated $5.6 billion for that in the five-year defense program.\n\nForeign companies will also benefit. Japan says it wants ship-launched U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Technologies to be part of its new deterrent force.\n\nTo pay for the military build-up, Kishida's ruling bloc earlier on Friday said it will raise tobacco, corporate and disaster-reconstruction income taxes. But, with opposition to tax hikes within his ruling Liberal Democratic party still strong, the Japanese leader has yet to say when he will implement those higher rates.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has captivated the world by rallying his country against a Russian invasion, visited Washington on Wednesdayhis first trip out of the country in three hundred days of war. With stops at the White House and the Capitol, what messages did Zelenskyy send to US President Joe Biden, members of Congress, and the American people? What does this trip mean for him and for Ukraine? Heres your expert guide to this historic visit. Well continue updating it as contributions roll in.\n\nWatch Zelenskyys address to Congress\n\nClick to jump to an expert reaction:\n\nAnalysis of Zelenskyys appearances at the White House and Congress\n\nJohn Herbst: A powerful message sent to Moscow, with one awkward moment\n\nRachel Rizzo: Dont expect a shift from Biden on long-range weapons\n\nMelinda Haring: Zelenskyys shrewd speech should make an impression on Congress\n\nDoug Klain: Zelenskyy strikes another contrast with Putin on the world stage\n\nYevgeniya Gaber: In the global war for democracy, Ukraines patriots need American Patriots\n\nAnalysis ahead of Zelenskyys arrival in Washington\n\nJohn Herbst: Zelenskyy wants more advanced weapons and explicit support for a Ukrainian victory\n\nDaniel Fried: The visit shows why the US is still the leader of the Free World\n\nMelinda Haring: An attempt to defuse the problem at the White House\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk: A courageous Zelenskyy arrives at a pivotal moment in the war\n\nPeter Dickinson: A plan to consolidate US support for a long struggle\n\nIan Brzezinski: A time for Washington to shed its exaggerated fear of escalation\n\nMatthew Kroenig: Ukraine wants to be able to shoot the archer, not just the arrows\n\nA powerful message sent to Moscow, with one awkward moment\n\nZelenskyys visit was a success for presidents Biden and Zelenskyy and strengthened the US-Ukraine relationship. With this visit, Ukraine received the Patriot air-defense system, the most advanced weapon system that the United States has yet to provide. This served as a clear message to Moscow that US investment in Ukraines defense will only grow. Zelenskyys cordial meeting with Biden and enthusiastically received address to Congress further underscored this.\n\nAt the same time, the visit also made clear the ongoing nuances in the bilateral relationship. The decision to provide Patriots is very important, but the United States is still reluctant to provide the longer range artillery, tanks, and fighter jets that would expedite Ukraines victory. That victory is very much in US interests, because Vladimir Putins revisionist objectives go beyond Ukraine and threaten NATO allies. Bidens one awkward moment during this visit came in the press conference when he was trying to explain why the United States would not provide offensive weapons. Zelenskyy came to the United States to enhance his relationship with Biden, so he did not directly challenge him on this; but in his congressional address he made a low-key pitch for more advanced weapons.\n\nMany commentators are referring to Zelenskyys visit as an historic one. That is true only if Ukraine wins this war. Ukraine will win if US support for Ukraine does not wane; and that victory will come faster if the White House decides to send the weapons Ukraine is requesting. Zelenskyys visit was certainly a contribution to such an outcome.\n\nJohn Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Councils Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nDont expect a shift from Biden on long-range weapons\n\nZelenskyy comes to Washington at the right time: The 118th Congress (with Republicans at the helm at the House of Representatives) commences on January 3, and the one-year anniversary of Russias invasion is just around the corner. To be clear, he deserved a heros welcome, and he got one. Zelenskyy hoped for two things during his visit: to thank the American people and ensure continued unity within the next Congress in terms of military and financial support to Ukraine, and to convince the Biden administration to send increasingly lethal weaponry, including the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).\n\nDuring his visit, the Biden administration formally announced the shipment of the Patriot missile-defense system to Ukraine, which is good news (and something the Ukrainians have sought over the last few months). But the aim of the United Statesto both support Ukraine while ensuring the United States and NATO dont get pulled into a broader warwill continue to preclude the shipment of the sort of weaponry Zelenskyy really wants. At a White House press conference alongside Zelenskyy, Biden said about Ukraine: \"Ive never seen NATO and the EU more united about anything at all, and I see no sign of there being any change.\" However, when asked about the ATACMS, Biden said that NATO is \"not looking to go to war with Russia\" and that that specific weaponry could shatter NATO unity. That should give us at least somewhat of a clear sense of where the Biden administration is (and has been) drawing the line in terms of support. I dont expect that to change significantly in the coming months.\n\nRachel Rizzo is a nonresident senior fellow at the Europe Center.\n\nZelenskyys shrewd speech should make an impression on Congress\n\nZelenskyy and Biden are the undisputed leaders of the free world. While Biden is a clunky speaker, his deep empathy and support for Ukraine will be his presidential legacy.\n\nZelenskyy is not a fluent speaker of English. Nevertheless he both delivered off-the-cuff remarks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and gave prepared remarks before Congress in English. Zelenskyys prepared remarks were shrewd: He thanked Congress repeatedly, reminded them that the fight for Ukraine is not just Kyivs problem, and dangled red meat in front of Republicans as he warned than Irans provision of drones for Russian use in Ukraine cannot be overlookedor Tehran will threaten other allies.\n\nZelenskyy and his team know that Congress and the American people control the purse. In his remarks with Biden, he thanked the American people first and repeatedly thanked Americans for their sacrifice and appealed to their decency.\n\nHis speech before Congress wasnt his bestbut blame the speechwriters. His historical references fell flat, but he did manage to elicit laughter at least once.\n\nZelenskyy was at his best when he teased Congress and said Ukrainian soldiers are more than capable of using American tanks and planes, and said directly that all US assistance is \"not charity\" and its used \"in the most responsible way.\"\n\nIn sum, Zelenskyy guaranteed that US assistance will continue \"as long as it takes,\" as Biden has repeatedly pledged, and undercut skeptical arguments on the American right.\n\nMelinda Haring is the deputy director of the Eurasia Center.\n\nZelenskyy strikes another contrast with Putin on the world stage\n\nThe key takeaway from Zelenskyys historic visit to Washingtonhis first time leaving Ukraine since the February invasionis that Ukrainians do not stand alone in their fight for survival. The images of Zelenskyy being embraced in the White House by Biden stand in stark contrast to Putins recent public appearances with the dictator he propped up in Belarus and the propagandists convincing more Russians to die in Ukraine.\n\nDespite fears that a Republican-led US House could stall further aid, support for Ukraine remains bipartisan and overwhelmingly popular with the American public. Perhaps Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it best on Wednesday: \"Continuing our support for Ukraine is morally right, but it is not only that. It is also a direct investment in cold, hard, American interests.\" It was important for Congress, and Americans, to finally hear first-hand from Zelenskyy why their support matters.\n\nWashington has provided historic and nation-saving aid to Ukraine, now totaling more than one hundred billion dollars. But the United States still needs to step upboth by catching up with other nations by rightly recognizing Russias crimes in Ukraine as genocide, but also by showing that giving Ukraine the weapons it needs to win wont provoke Moscow into starting a new war on top of the one its already losing. Ukraine is asking for critical weapons and armor, and allies such as Germany can be nudged in the right direction by a strong example from the United States, which continues to limit Kyivs ability to end this war sooner. For fear of provoking Putin, the White House said earlier this year it wouldnt send HIMARSthe game-changing system with which one Ukrainian officer earned a medal, which he sent with Zelenskyy to give to Biden as a thanks. All thats happened since the United States sent HIMARS is that Ukraines victories on the battlefield are more numerous.\n\nDoug Klain is a nonresident fellow at the Eurasia Center.\n\nIn the global war for democracy, Ukraines patriots need American Patriots\n\nThree hundred days into the war, the situation in Ukraine has approached a use-it-or-lose-it moment. With Russian massive attacks on critical infrastructure, millions of Ukrainians struggling to survive through the cold winter, and Ukrainian armed forces holding the front line despite the overwhelming Russian firepower, the war has entered a new phase. So far, Ukrainians have proved to be super effective and efficient in using the limited arsenal of arms supplied by their partners, oftentimes outperforming expectations and showing miracles of creativity and resilience. Reaching one hundred thousand Russian casualties and taking back more than a half of the initially occupied territories speaks for itself.\n\nHowever, all miracles have their limits, and the reality is grim. Though undertrained and underequipped, thousands of Russian soldiers have been mobilized in an ambitious plan to increase its military to 1.5 million. Despite international pressure, Russia has bolstered its attack capabilities with new batches of Iranian drones (and, potentially, ballistic missiles) and created multiple new units in Belarus to renew its assault on Ukraine from the north. To deter future waves of Russian aggression, let alone to start the counter-offensive, Ukrainian armed forces critically need to boost their air and missile defense, get longer-range weapons, and increase their rear-area attack capabilities.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor the world can afford the luxury of a protracted or postponed conflict. While Russia cannot obviously win this war on the battlefield, Ukraines victory is possible. Yet it is not irreversible, as the Kremlin is still strong enough to maintain its terror on Ukrainian cities, continue killing civilians, and disrupt international supply chains. Zelenskyys key message was clear: the only force that can put an end to the Russian war on global peace and security is Ukrainian patriots. But to succeed in defending global freedoms, they must be backed by American \"Patriots\"the advanced air-defense systemdefending Ukrainian cities.\n\nRallying the support of the American people and the US Congress remains crucial to ensure the victory of the democratic world. The display of the battle flag from Bakhmut in the US House chamber is a good reminder of where the front line of the global war for democracy runs.\n\nYevgeniya Gaber is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council IN TURKEY and was previously a foreign-policy advisor to the prime minister of Ukraine.\n\nWatch Zelenskyy at the White House\n\nZelenskyy wants more advanced weapons and explicit support for a Ukrainian victory\n\nIt looks like Zelenskyy is coming to DC as the Biden administration officially announces that it isfinallysending advanced Patriot air-defense systems to Ukraine. In light of the massive Russian bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure designed to make life in the winter intolerable, the Patriots are well worth Zelenskyys visit, although the leak last week of the Patriot decision makes this a bit of an anticlimax. The visit gives Zelenskyy and Biden the chance to sit down and talk about the war, and Zelenskyy the opportunity to address Congress and thank the American people for the massive support that has made it possible for Ukraine to withstand the Russian invasion. But Zelenskyy would like the Biden administration to publicly express its support for a Ukrainian victory in this war and to provide the more advanced weapons systemsaccurate artillery and missiles with a range up to three hundred kilometers (186 miles), tanks, and fighter jetsthat would enable Ukraine to take back all of its territory more quickly. Unfortunately, hesitation in the White House makes that outcome, which would serve American interests, a long shot.\n\nJohn Herbst is the senior director of the Atlantic Councils Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThe visit shows why the US is still the leader of the Free World\n\nWhile in Washington, Zelenskyy will probably urge intensified US assistance to cope with Russias ongoing attacks on Ukraines civilian infrastructure and more deliveries of powerful weapons to defend his country, such as air defenses, longer-range accurate artillery and missiles, and possibly tanks and aircraft. The omnibus spending bill that Congress is considering and may pass this week contains nearly $45 billion of additional assistance, and Zelenskyy may hope that his address can help get that assistance over the line.\n\nBut hes also after something more important: Ukrainians look to the United States as the leader of the Free World without irony or mixed feelings. They know that US supportin deed as well as wordhas thwarted Putins plans of national extermination and given Ukraine a fighting chance to win this war of survival. They didnt get the memo about supposed US disengagement, decline, or indifference. Zelenskyy is coming to Washington, not to Brussels, Paris, Berlin, or London, because when the chips are down, its the United States that has the power to make the difference in matters of war and peace. He knows this as much as Winston Churchill did in 1940, as Adolf Hitler battered Britain.\n\nLike Churchill, Zelenskyy also knows that some in the United States, a few on the left and more on the Donald Trump-aligned right, reject the Biden administrations commitment to Ukraine and to the Free World generally. Whether they are called neo-isolationists, America-firsters, or \"realists,\" they are willing, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly, to do a sphere-of-influences deal with Putin that would force Ukraine to surrender people and land to Russia, indifferent to the human and strategic disaster this would mean for Ukrainians and, soon thereafter, for others in Europe and for ourselves, as Putin consolidated such a prize and prepared his next aggression.\n\nZelenskyy is also coming to warn the United States against bad deals with dictators. He will not just thank the United States and the American people for their support. He will extoll our support for freedom over the past century, seeking to help us recall our best strategic traditions of helping those fighting for their freedom and ours.\n\nDaniel Fried is the Weiser Family distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former US ambassador to Poland.\n\nAn attempt to defuse the problem at the White House\n\nZelenskyy is taking a much-deserved victory lap in Washington today and is here to rally Congress to do more. Zelenskyy is not only commander in chief, hes also communicator in chief. With his pitch-perfect performance and gravelly voice, theres no one more convincing in Kyiv than the Ukrainian president. Hes also coming to defuse the problem at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House remains convinced that Ukraine cant win and that sending long-range missiles and planes would escalate the conflict. Zelenskyy is coming to change minds and burst the myth of these self-created limitations. Hes also coming to rally the world to give more and do more for Ukraine during the holiday season. His visit underscores the physical courage, conviction, and gravitas he has become known for around the worldthe opposite of Vladimir Putinsince the war began.\n\nMelinda Haring is the deputy director of the Eurasia Center.\n\nA courageous Zelenskyy arrives at a pivotal moment in the war\n\nIn the foreign affairs community, a first visit is very symbolic. The full-scale war marked a new era in Ukraine, so the fact Zelenskyys first visit after February 24 is to the United States underlines the decisive US role in Ukraines resistance. The United States is a crucial ally of Ukraine; it is a driver of the Ramstein format for international defense cooperation, provides most of the essential military assistance, supplies economic help, and deters Russian nuclear threats.\n\nUntil now, all post-February communication between US and Ukrainian leaders has been via calls and virtual meetings. That communication cannot replace in-person meetings. Thus, the visit had to occur at the earliest convenience, which was very difficult from a security perspective. Traveling around Ukraine and now abroad, Zelenskyy is showing he is ahead of Russia. He is demonstrating his commitment to personal presence, involvement, and initiative. The fact that Zelenskyy is making this trip, and his earlier trip to Bakhmut (perhaps the most dangerous place on our planet today), speaks to his courage.\n\nThe trip is necessary after the US midterm elections and just before Christmas. As the world enters a new year, US and Ukrainian leaders will outline their essential plans for 2023. Next year will be crucial for this war with the right amount of support. It may mark the wars end, with Ukraine able to push Russian occupants out of its territory. It will also be a year of commencing legal trials against Putin and his government and claiming damages. Thus, next years events may seriously damage and even end Putins regime. Today Putins plans are not working out, his troops have retreated from over half of the initially occupied territory, and he is desperate. To recover the lost initiative, he is planning a new mobilization and another offensive in the first quarter of 2023. That makes it critical for Ukraine to secure the right amount of military assistance.\n\nAndriy Zagorodnyuk is a distinguished fellow at the Eurasia Center and a former minister of defense of Ukraine.\n\nA plan to consolidate US support for a long struggle\n\nZelenskyys decision to visit the United States on what is his first wartime trip abroad highlights the critical importance of continued US support for the Ukrainian war effort. Following a relatively favorable outcome during the recent US midterm elections, there are no major concerns in Kyiv over the strength of the United States commitment to Ukraine. Nevertheless, there is an eagerness to win over skeptics within the Republican Party and consolidate US backing for what promises to be a protracted struggle.\n\nZelenskyy is well aware of his own star quality and knows that a personal presence in Washington will resonate with members of Congress and wider US audiences. One of the most important aspects of his wartime leadership has been his ability to rally international support. He is clearly hoping that such a high-profile visit to the United States will succeed in securing the political support Ukraine needs to continue fighting through 2023.\n\nThe visit will also send a powerful message to Ukraines other allies and to Russia that the United States stands firmly with Ukraine and will continue to do so in the coming year. This is crucial at a time when the Kremlin hopes to secure a ceasefire in order to rearm and is looking for signs that the West may be ready to compromise. Ukrainian leaders understand the importance of demonstrating to Moscow that such hopes are futile. Nothing could make this clearer than the fanfare of an official visit to the United States.\n\nPeter Dickinson is the editor of the Atlantic Councils UkraineAlert section.\n\nA time for Washington to shed its exaggerated fear of escalation\n\nZelenskyys dramatic visit to Washington occurs as the war has entered a crossroads, one that will determine if the war will decisively follow the path of Kyivs recent battlefield successes or bog down into a long-term, violent stalemate with immeasurable costs to Ukraine as well as growing economic burdens on the West.\n\nThe Biden administration has reportedly approved giving Ukraine Patriot air-defense systems to help defend against Putins indiscriminate missile barrages. Zelenskyy will express gratitude for that, but Kyiv also seeks offensive capabilities to push Russian forces off of Ukraines territorytanks, infantry fighting vehicles, aircraft, and longer-range artillery and missiles. All of those are required in short order to bring this war to a just and decisive end.\n\nToward that end, Zelenskyy will have to convince Washington to shed its exaggerated fear that a swift Ukrainian victory would cause Russia to escalate the war with nuclear weapons. Face-to-face meetings with Biden provide the most direct opportunity to make that case. That and an address to a joint session of Congress provide a global podium through which to immediately increase the US and Western commitment to Ukraines battle for survival.\n\nIan Brzezinski is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Councils Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and previously served as US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO policy.\n\nUkraine wants to be able to shoot the archer, not just the arrows\n\nZelenskyys surprise visit to Washington comes with huge risks and opportunities. Zelenskyy is the Winston Churchill of our time, and his personal wartime leadership has been an essential ingredient to Ukraines successful defense in the face of Putins war of aggression. Coming to Washington entails operational dangers to his personal safety; getting him in and out of Kyiv unharmed will be no easy task. And there are huge risks to Ukraines wartime effort if anything were to go wrong. It is doubtful that a successor would be nearly as charismatic or effective.\n\nBut the visit also brings huge potential opportunity. US aid and arms have been the other essential ingredient to Ukraines wartime success, and he hopes to get more of both with an in-person appeal to the US president, Congress, and people. With a planned prime-time address, Zelenskyy will attempt to persuade the American public and a new Congress that they benefit from supporting Ukraine. At the White House, Zelenskyy will attempt to convince Biden that he should lift arbitrary restrictions on weapons sales and give Kyiv the weapons it needs to shoot the archer, not just the arrows.\n\nIt should be a straightforward case to make. The United States greatest national security challenge is that, for the first time in its history, it faces two near-peer nuclear armed adversaries, Russia and China. By arming Ukraine, the United States can significantly blunt the Russian military threat without risking American lives. Here is hoping Zelenskyys trip, and the Ukrainian war effort, succeed.\n\nMatthew Kroenig is the acting director of the Councils Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, and a former US Department of Defense and intelligence community official.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: John E.

Why is he traveling to visit President Biden now?\n\nIn a conversation with Morning Edition's A Martinez on Wednesday, Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Zelenskyys visit to Washington is an attempt to gather support from lawmakers and \"push\" Biden and his administration to provide certain weapons.\n\n\"He wants to shore up Ukraine support in the Congress. Above all, with the Republicans who will soon be taking over the House. More broadly, with the American people,\" Haass said. \"And then secondly, he wants to push President Biden and the administration to be more forthcoming in providing certain types of weapons systems, above all longer-range missiles and the like that can attack Russian forces anywhere in Ukraine or even in Russia.\"\n\nHaass said the Biden administration is doing enough to sustain Ukraine in the war, and providing long-range offensive weapons does not support the administration's goal.\n\n\"We want to give Ukraine enough to defend itself,\" Haass said. \"We want to make sure Vladimir Putin does not succeed in extinguishing Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. But the Biden administration from the outset has been wary, to use President Biden's language, about starting World War III.\"\n\nHaass said neither Ukraine nor Russia is willing to compromise anytime soon; Putin \"wants to hang tough,\" and Zelenskyy and most Ukrainians \"want every square inch of their country back, including Crimea, which Russia took in 2014.\"\n\n\"I don't see it. In order for negotiations to succeed I've been involved in all sorts of negotiations as a former U.S. government official you need the leadership of the various sides to be both willing and able. Two important factors: Its willing and able to compromise. I don't see either side as willing.\"\n\nListen to the full conversation here.",

To kick things off, I just wanted to go over the ground rules really quickly. The contents of this call and everything we are about to discuss is under embargo until further notice.\n\nWhen we are able to lift the embargo, I will send everyone who RSVPd an email letting you know that the contents are now reportable. For planning purposes, we are not expecting that to be for at least several hours. Thank you again for your understanding, and we appreciate everyones flexibility.\n\nAs many of you may have guessed, tonights call is about President Zelenskyys visit to the White House tomorrow.\n\nFor your awareness and not for your reporting, our speaker tonight is [senior administration official].\n\n[Senior administration official], Ill turn it over to you for some opening remarks. And after that, Ill moderate the Q&A\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you, [moderator]. And thanks, everybody.\n\nIm glad to intrude on your evening with what I think is a pretty exciting piece of news, which is that at President Bidens invitation, President Zelenskyy will be visiting Washington, D.C., tomorrow and will have the opportunity to engage here at the White House and then go up to Capitol Hill. And in doing so, this visit will underscore the United States enduring commitment to Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden and President Zelenskyy discussed the visit of President Zelenskyy to Washington when they spoke on the phone on December 11th. And the White House formally invited President Zelenskyy to come tomorrow, Wednesday the 21st, last Wednesday the 14th. And in doing so, indicated that we wanted to host him for a program here at the White House that would involve an extended sit-down with President Biden, a meeting with key members of President Bidens national security team and Cabinet, an opportunity to address the press, and then an opportunity to go up to Capitol Hill to do a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe Ukrainian side President Zelenskyys office formally accepted the invitation last Friday. And then the visit was finally confirmed on Sunday, just three days ago, at which point the White House engaged with the Speakers office to notify them that President Zelenskyy would be traveling here and that they could work to coordinate together with the White House and President Zelenskyy the joint session that will be scheduled for tomorrow evening.\n\nWell have more details to share on the schedule soon. But again, just a quick overview: President Biden will first welcome President Zelenskyy at the White House for bilateral meetings. There will be the press conference and the opportunity to address members of the public. And then there will be an address by President Zelenskyy to a joint session of Congress demonstrating the strong bipartisan support for Ukraine. And then President Zelenskyy will return, after just a few short hours on the ground, to his people in Ukraine.\n\nWere looking forward to having President Zelenskyy back at the White House for his second visit but his first visit since the start of Russias brutal war against Ukraine. Its something weve wanted to do for some time. And tomorrow is actually the 300th day since Russia brutally invaded Ukraine in an all-out assault with the goal of wiping its neighbor off the map and subjecting the Ukrainian people to Russian dominion.\n\nRussia expected that this war would be quick work, that they would be in Kyiv and dominating the country within a matter of days. But here we are 300 days later, and Ukraine stands, Kyiv stands, the Ukrainian people stand. And Ukraine, in fact, has been pushing back against Russian aggression, reclaiming territory over the course of the past several weeks and months.\n\nOf course, in response to that, Russia has begun a barbaric campaign of attacking Ukraines critical infrastructure purposely destroying power, heat, and electricity in an attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people and cause human suffering. But Ukraines government and its people remain unbreakable, and theyve inspired the world with their resilience.\n\nIts been simply remarkable to watch how Ukraine, aided by U.S. support and the support of our allies and partners, has bravely defended its country, repelled Russian attacks, and retaken a significant amount of their territory.\n\nIn the meeting tomorrow, President Biden will have the opportunity with President Zelenskyy to have an in-depth strategic discussion on the way ahead on the battlefield; on the capabilities and training that the U.S. and our allies will continue to provide to Ukraine; on the sanctions and export controls that we have imposed and will continue to tighten and reinforce that have placed significant costs on Russias economy and Russias defense industrial base; and on the economic and energy sector assistance as well as the humanitarian assistance were providing to make life better for the people of Ukraine.\n\nOver the course of the past 300 days, President Biden has rallied the world to stand up for freedom and democracy and to stand with Ukraine as theyve defended themselves from Russias brutal war. Weve organized a coalition of more than 50 countries who are providing military assistance to help Ukraine defend its country. Weve provided economic assistance to make sure the Ukrainian government can keep providing basic services to the Ukrainian people. Weve provided humanitarian assistance to help support the millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes because of Putins war.\n\nAnd President Biden will have the opportunity to reinforce that this support is not just about what we have done before, but what we will do today and what we will continue to do for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, because Russia has shown no interest in being willing to end this brutal war, just as they were unwilling to engage in good-faith diplomatic efforts to avert this conflict in the first place, we know that in the days ahead the conflict will continue, the winter will be hard, and we will continue day in, day out to provide critical support to the Ukrainian people.\n\nIn fact, tomorrow, President Biden will announce a significant new package of nearly $2 billion of security assistance for Ukraine. It will contain a very important new capability: a Patriot missile battery, which will be a critical asset to defend the Ukrainian people against Russias barbaric attacks on Ukraines critical infrastructure. We will train Ukrainian forces on how to operate the Patriot missile battery in a third country. This will take some time, but Ukrainian troops will take that training back to their country to operate this battery.\n\nAnd we will continue to prioritize other forms of air defense support as well, including NASAMS, HAWKs, Stingers, and counter-UAV equipment.\n\nOn the course of this visit, we will also have the opportunity, along with Congress, to mark the work to pass a significant package of additional funding for Ukraine for 2023. And we anticipate a bipartisan package of more than $40 billion of funding for Ukraine.\n\nPresident Biden will continue to rally the world as we work to maintain the remarkable unity weve demonstrated over 2022. And as I said, he will reinforce the fundamental message on this trip to President Zelenskyy directly, to the Ukrainian people, the American people, and the world publicly that the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes and that in doing so, that support will remain broad, deep, and bipartisan.\n\nAnd with that, Id be happy to take your questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you so much, [senior administration official]. First, well go to Aamer Madhani from the Associated Press.\n\nQ Thanks, [senior administration official]. Could you talk a little bit about why now is an okay time for President Zelenskyy to leave Ukraine and visit, and if President Biden has any thoughts about visiting there soon?\n\nAnd then, secondly, how much of this visit is also about the President sending a message to the next Republican-led Congress about the need for the U.S. to keep the aid to Ukraine flowing as this war goes on, perhaps beyond even the next $45 billion that you hope to send? Thank you.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. With respect to the first question, of course theres no mathematical formula for the right day for President Zelenskyy to make his first trip out of the country. And, of course, I would defer to him to speak to his decision-making about why he felt this would be a good time.\n\nBut in his discussion with President Biden, what the two of them agreed upon was that having the opportunity for them to sit down together and for President Zelenskyy to be able to come to the United States to thank the American people for the incredible support that theyve received and to thank both parties, to thank the bipartisan support that hes received would be an important injection of momentum and sustenance to American and Allied support for the months ahead and for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd so, as the year draws to a close, as we head deeper into winter, as we continue to provide Ukraine the capabilities it needs on the battlefield, as we continue to surge diplomatic support and solidarity to Ukraine, this moment felt like a good opportunity for them to be able to have this engagement this personal face-to-face engagement and for President Zelenskyy to have this opportunity to address the American people.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy has indicated hes very keen was very keen to make his first visit to the United States to be able to send this message.\n\nBut again, Ill I wont say more than that and let him speak for himself.\n\nIn terms of the question of the timing as it relates to the new Congress, Ive said before and Ill reiterate here, as many others here at the White House have, that we have been confident all along that despite some rumors and suggestions to the contrary, support for Ukraine would remain broad, deep, and bipartisan. I think the vote that you will see on this substantial aid package demonstrates that, and I think the support you will see for President Zelenskyy at the joint session tomorrow demonstrates that as well.\n\nSo, this isnt about sending a message to a particular political party. This is about sending a message to Putin and sending a message to the world that America will be there for Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd President Putin badly miscalculated the beginning of this conflict when he presumed that the Ukrainian people would yield and that NATO would be disunited. He was wrong on both those counts; he remains wrong about our staying power. And thats what this visit will demonstrate.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you. And then, just because Ive gotten a few emails of people asking about the embargo because they joined late, I just want to remind everyone that the contents of this call are under embargo until further notice. When were able to lift the embargo, I will send to everyone who RSVPd an email letting you know that the contents are now reportable. And just for your planning purposes, we are not expecting that to be for at least several hours.\n\nWith that, well go to our next question, which is Steve Holland from Reuters.\n\nQ Hey. Thank you. [Senior administration official], will the President feel Zelenskyy out on the possibility for a diplomatic end to the war?\n\nAnd secondly, what are you expecting the war to stretch well into the new year? What whats your anticipation on that front?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On the second question, Russia could, of course, end the war tomorrow by pulling out of Ukraine. They show no intention of doing so and no intention of seriously sitting down to commit to doing so. So, we do not see diplomacy that would lead to an end to the war on just terms as being on the very near-term horizon.\n\nPresident Biden has been absolutely clear from the start, even before the start of this war, that his principle is \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\"; that he is not going to pressure or push Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, but rather, he is going to work with Congress and with our allies to put Ukraine in the best possible position on the battlefield so that when the time is ripe, they are in the best possible position at the negotiating table.\n\nAnd they will discuss every element of this conflict, including the situation on the battlefield and including the question of where the war goes from here. And I wont say more than that today because I think its very important for them to have the opportunity to discuss it.\n\nBut what I will reinforce is that the President is not coming with a message that is about pushing or prodding or poking Zelenskyy in any way. This is going to be a message of solidarity and support, coordination and alignment, and making sure that we are very much putting Ukraine in the best possible position to defend its interests and secure its objectives.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question, well go to Asma Khalid from NPR.\n\nQ Hi there. Thanks. Can you all hear me?\n\nMODERATOR: Yes, we can.\n\nQ Hi. [Senior administration official], could you speak at all to the risk assessment in Zelenskyy flying here at this particular moment and your confidence that, presumably, Russia will not take drastic actions while he is out of the country?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, Russia has been taking drastic action on a near daily basis in Ukraine, trying to plunge the entire country into cold and dark as we head into the dead of winter rolling over towns and villages, wantonly killing civilians, bombing hospitals, maternity wards, you name it. And I think we can expect the same in the days ahead.\n\nSo Russia has shown no signs of abating its widespread and barbaric attacks against Ukrainian cities and towns, Ukrainian civilians, Ukrainian critical infrastructure.\n\nWe had the opportunity to consult closely with President Zelenskyy on the security parameters of him being able to depart the country, come to the United States for a brief period, and return.\n\nOf course, it ultimately was his decision to make. He concluded that those security parameters were you know, met what he needed. We agreed with that, and so we are executing accordingly.\n\nAnd, you know, Russia will continue to do what Russia does, and we will continue to do what we do, and that is to not be deterred from our support for Ukraine and for us and Zelenskyy to not be deterred to travel as he sees fit to advance his peoples interests and his countrys interests.\n\nAnd I would point out that, just this morning, he traveled to the town of Bakhmut in the east, which is very close to the frontlines in the east. He has previously traveled to other areas right out there on the frontlines. And he makes his own determinations about that travel based on what he believes is best going to deliver for his people.\n\nHe made the same calculus when it comes to coming to the United States. He feels this is something that is going to aid the fight for Ukraine. And we are determined to ensure that it aids the fight in Ukraine by projecting a strong message of unity and resolve from the White House, from Washington, from the free world, on behalf of all of the nations supporting Ukraine. Thats what we intend to do tomorrow.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. For our next question, well go to Peter Alexander with NBC News.\n\nQ I appreciate you hosting this, [senior administration official]. If you could walk us through a little bit of the timetable of what we should anticipate tomorrow acknowledging this will come out as part of the embargo: when youre hoping this will happen over the course of the day; when the joint address would take place; anyone with whom hes traveling tomorrow. Is the First Lady of Ukraine traveling with him or any other key individuals?\n\nAnd in terms of his travel here, is the U.S. is he traveling in any form with U.S. transport? Appreciate any more details as to the specific timeline relates to tomorrows\n\nplans.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Peter, great questions all. Im going to defer the delegation question to the Ukrainians, and they will speak to that when they come out.\n\nOn timing, I will what I will say is that this is going to be afternoon into evening, is what we anticipate. But Im not going to say anything further than that.\n\nAnd then on the rest of the questions around the details of what youre looking for, we will try to get you that information tomorrow once hes here. But Im at this point, Im not at liberty to share.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you. And, Peter, and for everyone out there, we will have an email updated email late tonight with some updated daily guidance for everyone with timing as well. So youll be able to go into tomorrow morning knowing exactly the timing.\n\nFor our next question, well go to Michael Shear from the New York Times.\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hey, [senior administration official]. Thanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit to the message that the President President Biden wants to send to the American people with this visit. Hes obviously been hes obviously been very direct about the fact that, from a timing standpoint, theres no you know, hes going to stick with this for \"as long as it takes,\" I think is what he said. But hes also, in the past and certainly at the beginning, put limits on U.S. participation in the war in Ukraine no boots on the ground and the like.\n\nIs there any is there any sense in which this should suggest to the American people that that those kinds of limits are changing and that he might tell Zelenskyy that the U.S. is willing to be more deeply involved than he had, sort of, suggested to the American people in the past?\n\nSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No. The President has been very clear from the beginning. He hasnt wavered from and he wont waver from it tomorrow, or next month or next year, that the United States is not sending forces to Ukraine to directly fight the Russians. What we are sending instead is billions now, tens of billions of dollars worth of military equipment and supplies, sophisticated weaponry to help Ukrainians defend themselves.\n\nAnd I noted with respect to his announcement on the Patriot battery tomorrow as to that, we will train Ukrainians in a third country to operate that battery. Once trained, they will go in with the battery to man it in Ukraine; it wont be U.S. personnel who are doing that. And nothing will change in that regard.\n\nThe President has been very clear that we are going to lean forward and be robust in our support for Ukraine on the military, economic, energy, and humanitarian fronts, but we are not seeking to engage in a direct war with Russia. And nothing about that will change tomorrow.\n\nWhat tomorrow is about is an opportunity to reinforce to the American people that thanks chiefly to the bravery of the Ukrainian people, but also thanks to the support that the American people have provided, Kyiv stands, Kharkiv stands, Kherson stands as proud Ukrainian cities that have resisted Russian conquest, and that Ukraine as a nation is standing proud and tall and pushing back against Russian aggression. And what we are doing to help support Ukraine is helping to secure these victories.\n\nAnd he is going to reinforce that the key now for us to demonstrate, not just through words but through resources and through the support we are actively giving, is that we will stand by Ukraine, stand with Ukraine for as the question said, as Ive said, as President has said as long as it takes.\n\nSo this is a message of resolve. Its a message of conviction that we are doing the right thing here. And its a message of support for the President of Ukraine and his people at this critical hour, at this moment as we head deeper into winter, where they deserve to know that America is standing with them, and they deserve to know that the world is standing with them.\n\nMODERATOR: Great, thank you. And I believe [senior administration official] has to run, so I just want to say thank you, everyone, for joining this call on short notice. And thank you, [senior administration official], for taking the time.\n\nAs a reminder of the parameters of this call, it was held on background, attributable to a \"senior administration official.\"\n\nAgain, I will email everyone who RSVPd with a note letting you know when the embargo is lifted and the contents of this call will be reportable. For your planning purposes, again, I would not expect that for at least several hours, but well keep everyone posted.\n\nIm more than happy to answer any other logistical questions that anyone has offline.\n\nAgain, we will be sending out a daily guidance email the White House press team will be late tonight. So everyone will be able to wake up tomorrow morning knowing exactly what time they should expect what.\n\nWith that, thank you again for joining the call tonight, and I appreciate your flexibility and understanding.\n\n7:02 P.M.

                "cc_text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky called on Ukrainians to have \"patience and faith\" in a defiant Christmas address after a deadly wave of Russian strikes pounded the southern city of Kherson.\n\nTen months into Russias war on Ukraine, Zelensky spoke of endurance and pushing through to the end, while acknowledging that \"freedom comes at a high price.\"\n\nHe urged the nation to stand firm in the face of a grim winter of energy blackouts, the absence of loved ones and the ever-present threat of Russian attacks.\n\nZelenskys message came after Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched deadly rocket strikes into downtown Kherson on Christmas Eve, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens. Zelensky described those attacks as \"killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.\"\n\nA rescuer extinguishes a fire in a burning shop after Russian shelling on the city of Kherson on December 24, 2022. Dimitar Kilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWe will find each other\n\nIn his Christmas message, Zelensky acknowledged that all holidays have a bitter aftertaste for the besieged country this year.\n\n\"We can feel the traditional Spirit of Christmas differently. Dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm.\n\n\"There may be empty chairs around it. And our houses and streets cant be so bright. And Christmas bells can ring not so loudly and inspiringly. Through air raid sirens, or even worse gunshots and explosions.\"\n\nHe said that Ukraine had been resisting evil forces for three hundred days and eight years, however, \"in this battle, we have another powerful and effective weapon. The hammer and sword of our spirit and consciousness. The wisdom of God. Courage and bravery. Virtues that incline us to do good and overcome evil.\"\n\nAddressing the Ukrainian people directly, he said the country would sing Christmas carols louder than the sound of a power generator and hear the voices and greetings of relatives \"in our hearts\" even if communication services and the internet are down.\n\n\"And even in total darkness we will find each other to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will give a big hug to warm each other.\"\n\nZelensky concluded: \"We will celebrate our holidays! As always. We will smile and be happy. As always. The difference is one. We will not wait for a miracle. After all, we create it ourselves.\"\n\nUkraine has traditionally celebrated Christmas on January 7 in line with Orthodox Christian customs, which acknowledge the birth of Jesus according to the Julian calendar.\n\nBut a yearslong rift between the Ukrainian and Russian branches of the Orthodox church has widened since Moscows invasion in February.\n\nOne branch of Ukraines Orthodox church announced last month that it would allow its churches to celebrate Christmas on December 25. And many younger Ukrainians are now choosing to observe the holiday on December 25 in a bid to move away from Russia and towards the Western world.\n\nOn Sunday evening, a few dozen people gathered around a darkened Christmas tree in Kyivs Sophia Square, in the center of the Ukrainian capital, and broke out in applause when the generator kicked in and the trees blue and yellow lights switched on.\n\nIhor Zholudiev, an IT specialist originally from Ukraines second largest city, Kharkiv, told CNN that he found the moment \"inspiring.\"\n\n\"This Christmas is special for us, because we can celebrate it in this difficult year,\" Zholudiev said. His wishes for Christmas, the new year and his birthday are the same: \"victory and peaceful sky above our heads.\n\nOlena Vedmid, a photographer, described cobbling together dinner with her family amid the frequent power outages in the capital.\n\n\"We had electricity for half a day, so we had time to cook the dishes,\" she said. \"This year we celebrated by candlelight and it was great. Everyone liked it, because it was cozy and sincere.\"\n\nA Ukrainian couple pictured in Kyiv's Sophia Square on Christmas Day in the Ukrainian capital. Svitlana Vlasova/CNN\n\nKherson strikes\n\nHours before Zelensky delivered his Christmas address, a series of deadly Russian strikes slammed into the city of Kherson, where apartments and medical facilities were among the buildings hit, according to Yaroslav Yanushevych, head of the regions military administration.\n\nYanushevych said Sunday that a total of 16 people had been killed in 71 Russian attacks across the wider Kherson region on Saturday, including three state emergency workers who were killed during demining operations. Another 64 people received injuries of varying severity, he said.\n\nZelensky condemned the shelling of Kherson as an act of \"terror.\"\n\nZelensky condemned the shelling as an act of \"terror.\" Dimitar Kilkoff/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The terrorist country continues bringing the Russian world in the form of shelling of the civilian population. Kherson. In the morning, on Saturday, on the eve of Christmas, in the central part of the city,\" he said.\n\n\"These are not military facilities,\" he wrote on Telegram Saturday. \"This is not a war according to the rules defined. It is terror, it is killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.\"\n\nIn November, Russias military retreated from Kherson city, the only regional capital it had captured since the invasion began, in a major setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, Russian forces have stationed themselves across the river from Kherson and regularly shell the city from there.\n\nPutin says he is ready to negotiate with everyone involved\n\nPutin said he is ready to \"negotiate with everyone involved in this process about acceptable solutions,\" regarding the war in Ukraine, according to Russian state news agency TASS, citing Putins interview with state TV Sunday.\n\n\"I dont think it is so dangerous, I think we are moving in the right direction, protecting our national interests and the interests of our citizens, our people. And we simply have no other choice but to protect our citizens,\" Putin said. \"We are ready to negotiate with everyone involved in this process about acceptable solutions, but its up to them. Its not us who is refusing to negotiate, its them.\"\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted in response saying \"Putin needs to come back to reality.\"\n\nPodolyak tweeted that Russia \"single-handedly attacked Ukraine and is killing citizens\" and that \"Russia doesnt want negotiations, but tries to avoid responsibility. This is obvious, so we are moving to the Tribunal.\"\n\nPutins remarks come as Russia continues its offensive against Ukraine. On Sunday Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said Russian troops hit Kramatorsk with three rockets. An industrial area was hit but there were no casualties.",
