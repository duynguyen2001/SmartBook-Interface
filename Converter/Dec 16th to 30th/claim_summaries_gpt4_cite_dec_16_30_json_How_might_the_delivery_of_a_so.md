<template v-slot:summary>
The introduction of the Patriot Air Defense System to Ukraine by the United States could significantly alter the strategic balance in the Ukraine-Russia conflict by providing enhanced protection against Russian air superiority, potentially neutralizing one of Russia's key advantages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. With the ability to intercept a variety of threats including cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and aircraft at high altitudes, the Patriot system could degrade Russian capabilities to target Ukrainian infrastructure and inhibit their control of the skies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, this move risks provoking heavier Russian attacks and escalates the conflict, as Russia has warned of unspecified "consequences" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, the potential supply of the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) to Ukraine could further empower Ukrainian forces to strike at Russian targets at greater ranges, thereby aiding in reclaiming more territory and disrupting Russian logistics <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.

The delivery of the Patriot air defense system to Ukraine by the United States marks a significant upgrade in Ukrainian air defense capabilities, with the potential to alter the strategic balance on the ground in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The Patriot system is capable of intercepting cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, and aircraft, offering protection at a significantly higher ceiling than previous air defense systems supplied to Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This could help mitigate Russia's air superiority and limit the effectiveness of its systematic targeting of Ukrainian infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. However, the provision of such advanced weaponry raises the stakes, with Russia warning of unspecified "consequences" and viewing the shipments as an escalation of US involvement in the conflict, despite US intentions to avoid direct conflict with Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strategic impact of the Patriot system is twofold: it could enhance Ukrainian forces' ability to protect critical infrastructure and civilian targets from Russian attacks, and potentially enable Ukraine to regain more territory by degrading Russian logistics and command and control <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. However, the system's size and expense mean that only a few units can be sent, limiting the breadth of its protection <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the delivery of the Patriot system has been met with Russian assertions that it will not deter them from achieving their goals, indicating that the conflict is likely to continue with heightened intensity <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Lastly, the advanced air defense system's arrival on the Ukrainian battlefield requires training for Ukrainian forces, which means its impact may not be immediate <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> The Patriot missiles could offer some protection to Ukraine but could also prompt Russia to carry out heavier attacks.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/beyond-weapons-the-hindu-editorial-on-ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskys-visit-to-washington/article66293333.ece" target="_blank">thehindu.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 22nd, 2022</div></div>| Currently, Ukraine has a battlefield advantage, recapturing swathes of territories in the northeast and south. But Russia has air superiority. The Patriot missiles could offer some protection to Ukraine but could also prompt Russia to carry out heavier attacks. This leaves Mr. Biden in a dilemma.|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2022/12/send-the-ground-launched-small-diameter-bomb-to-ukraine/" target="_blank">breakingdefense.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 19th, 2022</div></div>| One way to do that, which is apparently now under consideration, is sending Kyiv the Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB). This system, which integrates an existing munition and rocket at a relatively low cost, would enable the Ukrainian military to strike high-value Russian targets well beyond the range of current Western-supplied munitions. That would help Ukrainian forces further degrade Russian logistics and command and control and ultimately retake more territory. For this reason, the Pentagon should move without delay to provide Kyiv with the GLSDB.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Precisely what overall effect Patriot systems will have is difficult to say.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63994648" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Iran's involvement in supplying Russia with attack drones and perhaps other weapons increases the concern. The net effect is more advanced Western systems into Ukraine, something Moscow did not want to happen. Precisely what overall effect Patriot systems will have is difficult to say. They will certainly provide an additional layer of protection, but their size and expense means that few units will be able to be sent.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> But as Russia faced increasing setbacks on the ground, it began systematically targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine in attacks that have disrupted electricity, water and heat to millions of people.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221221-%F0%9F%94%B4-us-to-provide-advanced-patriot-air-defense-system-to-ukraine" target="_blank">france24.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 21st, 2022</div></div>| "Today's assistance for the first time includes the Patriot Air Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems," US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Ukraine's air defenses have played a key role in protecting the country from strikes and preventing Moscow's forces from gaining control of the skies. But as Russia faced increasing setbacks on the ground, it began systematically targeting critical infrastructure in Ukraine in attacks that have disrupted electricity, water and heat to millions of people. Made by Raytheon, the MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system initially developed to intercept high-flying aircraft.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> Russia has warned on unspecific "consequences" if the US provided Ukraine with Patriot missiles, viewing the shipments as further US engagement in the war.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://kslnewsradio.com/1981010/zelensky-arrives-at-white-house-for-historic-meeting-with-biden/" target="_blank">kslnewsradio.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 21st, 2022</div></div>| The system is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as some aircraft. Because of its long-range and high-altitude capability, it can potentially shoot down Russian missiles and aircraft far from their intended targets inside Ukraine. Russia has warned on unspecific "consequences" if the US provided Ukraine with Patriot missiles, viewing the shipments as further US engagement in the war. The official was clear, however, that Biden remained steadfast in keeping the United States out of direct conflict with Russia, despite the enhanced security assistance.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> It is by no means clear that military deterrence would be enough to secure the resulting peace.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/foreign-affairs" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/no-one-would-win-long-war-ukraine" target="_blank">Foreign Affairs</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 21st, 2022</div></div>| The best plausible outcome for Ukraine would be the retreat of Russian forces to the lines of control that existed before the February 2022 invasion. But even if the Russians are swept back to the status quo ante, many Ukrainians fear that Moscow will simply retrench and regroup, waiting for the next opportunity to invade. It is by no means clear that military deterrence would be enough to secure the resulting peace. What is missing, then, is a coherent political plan to bring an end to the suffering, and to reassure Ukrainians that Russia will not begin a new war at the earliest opportunity, even if Putin remains in power.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Mr Peskov added that delivering Patriot missiles would not prevent Russia from "achieving its goals during the special military operation".|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64066584" target="_blank">BBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| The White House says they will help defend Ukrainians against "Russia's barbaric attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure". Moscow has complained that no calls for peace were heard during President Zelensky's trip to Washington - with spokesman Dmitry Peskov describing this as proof that the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia. Mr Peskov added that delivering Patriot missiles would not prevent Russia from "achieving its goals during the special military operation". "The talks in Washington have shown that neither Ukraine nor the United States is seeking peace.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> "It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets," retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks previously told CNN of the systems capabilities.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/patriot-missiles-ukraine/index.html" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 21st, 2022</div></div>| The US announced a new aid package to Ukraine on Tuesday, which included the "first-ever transfer to Ukraine of the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, capable of bringing down cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and aircraft at a significantly higher ceiling than previously provided air defense systems," according to a State Department spokesperson. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden. "It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets," retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks previously told CNN of the systems capabilities. The Patriots radar system combines "surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit," a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The decision to send the Patriot battery comes despite threats from Russias Foreign Ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface-to-air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the Patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for Moscows military.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221220-ukrainian-president-zelensky-plans-to-travel-to-us-on-wednesday-us-media-reports" target="_blank">france24.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 20th, 2022</div></div>| The aid signals an expansion by the US in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to Ukraine to bolster its air defences against what has been an increasing barrage of Russian missiles in recent weeks. The package will include about $1 billion in weapons from Pentagon stocks and $800 million in funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, officials said. The decision to send the Patriot battery comes despite threats from Russias Foreign Ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface-to-air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the Patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for Moscows military. Its not clear exactly when the Patriot would arrive on the front lines in Ukraine, since US troops will have to train Ukrainian forces on how to use the high-tech system.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> I think the Ukrainians will stand firm, they will improve their resilience with all of the deliveries of both electrical equipment, but also of air defense equipment from the United States and allies.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/heightened-urgency-for-training-ukrainians-amid-dynamic-winter-top-pentagon-official-to-voa/6879302.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 16th, 2022</div></div>| And so, I think we can foresee that Russia will continue to try to intimidate the Ukrainian civilian population and the Ukrainian government into you know, some sort of submission. That's not going to happen. I think the Ukrainians will stand firm, they will improve their resilience with all of the deliveries of both electrical equipment, but also of air defense equipment from the United States and allies. At the same time, the other prong of what Russia's strategy has been is to kind of push forward with their forces in attempting to eke out additional territorial games.|
