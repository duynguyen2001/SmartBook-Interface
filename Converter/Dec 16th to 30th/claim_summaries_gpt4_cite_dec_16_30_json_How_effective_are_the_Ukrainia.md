<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Ukrainian air defenses have exhibited some success in intercepting and downing Russian missiles targeting urban areas, as evidenced by taking out 60 out of 76 incoming missiles in a recent attack <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, despite these efforts, there have been reports of "colossal" damage in cities like Kharkiv, indicating challenges in completely mitigating the impact of such assaults on critical infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Ukrainian air defense systems have had some success in mitigating the effects of Russian missile attacks on urban areas, intercepting 60 out of 76 incoming missiles aimed at critical infrastructure according to Ukraine's top general <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite these efforts, significant damage has still been reported in cities like Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, with threats to essential services like heating during winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Air defences face challenges as Moscow employs tactics such as using warplanes to distract them <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, the adaptation of advanced weapons like the AGM-88 HARM by Ukrainian forces shows a commitment to enhancing their interception capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Ukrainian air defense systems have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in intercepting incoming Russian missiles aimed at urban areas, as evidenced by various reports. During a significant Russian missile attack, Ukraine's top general reported that air defenses managed to shoot down 60 out of 76 missiles, showcasing a high success rate in neutralizing threats to critical infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, Ukrainian forces have been able to adapt advanced weaponry such as the AGM-88 HARM ARM to further bolster their air defense capabilities, indicating a move towards utilizing more sophisticated systems to counter assaults on civilian populations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. Moreover, the Ukrainian military has had repeated successes in downing missiles and drones, with the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv acknowledging the air defense's efforts amid escalatory attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>However, despite the high interception rates in some instances, the pressure on Ukraine's air defense remains intense with large-scale attacks causing "colossal" damage and threatening essential services like heating during winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. The Ukrainian military claimed to have intercepted 54 out of 69 missiles in a recent wave of strikes, which aligns with their continued effective use of air defenses in urban areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>. The effectiveness of the Ukrainian air defense is also supported by the use of HIMARS systems, which have been deadly accurate in targeting Russian positions, forcing Russian forces to adjust their tactics and move assets out of reach <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Nonetheless, the effectiveness is not absolute, as cities still endure periods without heat, electricity, or internet following attacks, and the increasing time between Russian strikes suggests a possible rationing of missile supplies, adding a layer of unpredictability to the defense efforts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

The governor of the central region of Dnipropetrovsk reported "serious damage". Air defences took out 60 out of 76 incoming missiles fired at critical infrastructure, Ukraine's top general said. Moscow deliberately tried to distract the air defences by flying warplanes near Ukraine, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said.|

With Russian massive attacks on critical infrastructure, millions of Ukrainians struggling to survive through the cold winter, and Ukrainian armed forces holding the front line despite the overwhelming Russian firepower, the war has entered a new phase. So far, Ukrainians have proved to be super effective and efficient in using the limited arsenal of arms supplied by their partners, oftentimes outperforming expectations and showing miracles of creativity and resilience. Reaching one hundred thousand Russian casualties and taking back more than a half of the initially occupied territories speaks for itself.|

But all of this requires pilots to be highly professional, organized, willing to take risks, and self-sacrificing. Everything that Russian pilots lack so much, judging by the fact that there are very few cases of effective suppression of our Ukrainian SAMs, and Russian pilots preferred to kill the civilian population of our cities. At the same time, the AGM-88 HARM ARM (and other modern world aviation weapons), which the Ukrainian aviation has successfully adapted, has a completely different philosophy.|

The system could include a multi-purpose warhead tailored for fixed, hardened, low collateral damage, and moving targets. The GLSDB would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian military targets up to 150 km away with an accuracy of around one meter. With integration, the GLSDB can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS rocket artillery systems already supplied to Ukraine by the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.|

The previous such round of massive Russian air strikes across the country took place on Dec. 5. Ukrainian authorities have reported some successes in intercepting and downing incoming missiles, rockets and armed drones in recent weeks, including on Friday. "Grateful for the work of Ukraines air defense amid more escalatory Russian attacks this morning on civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and around the country," the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, Bridget Brink, wrote on Twitter.|

Until then, Ukraine and Russia continue to wage smaller battles across the front lines in the south and east, with trench lines taking a pummeling from artillery and small drone strikes, and small patches of land changing hands on a daily basis. And while the HIMARS has proven itself deadly accurate in targeting Russian positions, Putins forces have adjusted to that threat. The Russians have moved their command and control nodes and weapons depots out of the 80-mile range of HIMARS batteries to points further south in Crimea, said one person familiar with Ukrainian battlefield assessments.|

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said a number of energy facilities were damaged and that "Russia is trying to deprive Ukrainians of light before the new year." However, the Ukrainian military said it had managed to neutralize most of the missiles, avoiding much larger damage. "According to preliminary data, 69 missiles were launched in total.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> The Ukrainian military has reported success in shooting down incoming Russian missiles and explosive drones in earlier attacks but many cities have gone without heat, internet and electricity for hours or days at a time.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-ukraine-war-day-309-1.6699335" target="_blank">CBC News</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| At the same time, Moscow has methodically targeted Ukrainian power facilities and other key infrastructure in a bid to weaken the country's resolve and force it to negotiate on Russian terms. The time between strikes has increased in recent weeks, though, leading some commentators to theorize Russia is trying to ration its missile supply. The Ukrainian military has reported success in shooting down incoming Russian missiles and explosive drones in earlier attacks but many cities have gone without heat, internet and electricity for hours or days at a time. Anastasia, a medic who took shelter Thursday at a central Kyiv subway station and gave only her first name, said she was tired of the war.|

Blasts were also heard in the cities of Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv and Zhytomyr. Ukraine's military said 69 missiles were launched, with air defences intercepting 54 of them. Earlier, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said more than 120 missiles had been launched at civilian infrastructure.|
