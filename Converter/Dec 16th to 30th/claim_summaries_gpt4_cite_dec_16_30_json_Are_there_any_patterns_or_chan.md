<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The frequency of Russian missile attacks on Ukraine, including Kyiv, has seen variation, with recent weeks witnessing an increase in time between strikes, suggesting a possible rationing of missile supplies by Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Despite this, Kyiv has experienced significant barrages, including a major attack with over 100 missiles on November 15 and repeated strikes since mid-October, with the Ukrainian military actively engaging and intercepting many of these attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>.

Russian missile attacks on Ukraine have intensified with the most significant assault occurring on November 15, involving over 100 missiles aimed at cities and critical infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Despite this, the frequency of the strikes has shown signs of decreasing recently, leading to speculation that Russia might be conserving its missile supplies <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Ukrainian air defenses have had some success in intercepting these attacks, although power outages and disruptions to heat and internet services have been reported following the assaults <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Moreover, a massive strike with over 120 missiles was launched by Russia recently, indicating a continuation of their strategy to target Ukraine's energy facilities, especially during the winter season <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The frequency and scale of Russian missile attacks across Ukraine have varied over recent months. Initially, these attacks were more frequent, with a particularly heavy assault occurring on November 15, when over 100 missiles were launched at a dozen cities, including targeting the country's critical energy infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, the time between these strikes has recently increased, suggesting that Russia may be rationing its missile supply <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. Moreover, despite the Ukrainian military's successes in shooting down incoming missiles and drones, these attacks have resulted in significant disruptions to essential services, leaving many cities without heat, internet, and electricity for extended periods <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Kyiv has experienced intermittent missile strikes since mid-October, with air raid alarms warning residents of new barrages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The intensity of these attacks peaked again in recent weeks, with over 120 missiles fired in one of the biggest waves of strikes, as reported on December 17, 2022 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These strikes have not only been aimed at military targets but have also damaged power stations and other critical infrastructure, exacerbating the difficulties faced by civilians during the winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Notably, the Ukrainian Prime Minister reported that 40% of the network facilities transporting electricity had been damaged, affecting power delivery <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Power restoration efforts were underway, with nearly 6 million Ukrainians having their electricity restored within 24 hours following one set of attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The Russians have moved their command and control nodes and weapons depots out of the 80-mile range of HIMARS batteries to points further south in Crimea, said one person familiar with Ukrainian battlefield assessments. Those movements have blunted some of the weapons effectiveness, and increased calls for the longer-range ATACMS missiles, which can travel 190 miles before precisely striking a target.

The experience of the Russian decorated aces, which they gained by bombing the defenseless cities and towns of Syria, turned out to be completely useless for the War in Ukraine, and the number of "those who did not return from a combat mission" of Russian pilots increased rapidly. Everything that happened and is happening in the air war on the Russian side is now dictated not by design, but exclusively by reaction to the development of events. The transition to missile terror tactics, an increase in the share of fate in the missile strikes of the "not new" Kh-22 (AS-4 Kitchen) and Kh-59 (AS-13 Kingbolt) air-based cruise missiles, the use of the S-300 (SA-10 Grumble) Air Defense system against ground targets, the humiliating purchase of kamikaze drones from Iran and their widespread use by the "superpower" against civilian infrastructure is far from a complete list of the Russian Federation's desperate attempts to change the course of events and intercept the strategic air initiative.|
