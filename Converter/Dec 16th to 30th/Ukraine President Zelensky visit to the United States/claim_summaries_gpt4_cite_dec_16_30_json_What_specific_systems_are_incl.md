The new air defense package from the United States to Ukraine includes several sophisticated systems aimed at bolstering Ukrainian defense capabilities. The centerpiece of the package is the Patriot missile system, which is a highly advanced air defense system designed to protect against missiles and drones; it's expected to significantly strengthen Ukraine's air defense and help safeguard its cities from Russian attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. In addition to the Patriot system, the package also contemplates the possibility of providing Ukraine with other advanced systems in the future, such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), as well as the GLSDB, a ground-launched small diameter bomb which combines a precision-guided munition with a low-cost rocket to target enemy logistics and command centers <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>These systems are intended to address the specific challenges Ukraine faces, particularly the barrage of missile attacks on critical infrastructure that have been a hallmark of Russian tactics, aiming to degrade Ukrainian morale and capabilities <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The Patriot missile system, with its PAC-3 modification, is especially crucial for its long-range interception capabilities, allowing Ukraine to potentially close gaps in its national air defense against ballistic targets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The inclusion of the GLSDB further expands Ukraine's ability to strike at a distance and target a variety of Russian assets, thus contributing to the broader goal of degrading enemy forces and reclaiming lost territory <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The combination of these systems represents a significant escalation in the defensive aid provided by the US and underscores the commitment to support Ukraine's fight for freedom and independence <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

The attacks, which officials here say are designed to break Ukrainian morale, have left millions without electricity and heating as temperatures across the country plummet below freezing.|

Zelensky viewed the US decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine as a major shift in the relationship between the two allies. The new, $1.8 billion package Biden unveiled includes a Patriot surface-to-air missile system, which has been a longstanding request of Ukraines to fend of Russian air attacks.

In the future, as a long-range air defense system, provided that the partners make appropriate decisions, it is possible to use, for example, the American THAAD. At the same time, these medium-range and long-range air defense systems will make it possible to fill the gaps in the capabilities of the national Air Defense to combat ballistic targets. It should be noted that the traditional continuity and unification of most models of foreign armaments of Air Defense forces allow only by changing the equipment and nomenclature of SA missiles to significantly expand the capabilities of the complex itself.|
