The bombardment included the deployment of air and sea-based cruise missiles and anti-aircraft missiles directed at energy infrastructure facilities across eastern, central, western, and southern regions of Ukraine, exacerbating the hardships for civilians by leaving them without essential services like heat, power, or running water <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strikes on Kyiv's infrastructure were not isolated incidents but part of a concerted effort targeting substations, which are critical in the power delivery process from power plants to end users <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. This has been a consistent strategy, with Russian missiles repeatedly aiming at Ukraine's energy facilities, an action that Ukrainian officials and some international leaders have labeled as potential war crimes <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. The attacks have had a profound impact on civilian life, directly affecting millions by crippling the power grid that supplies homes and businesses, and have been recognized as an attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.
