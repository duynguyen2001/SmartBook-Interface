Ukrainian officials are working tirelessly to restore basic services amidst Russian bombardments targeting infrastructure. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that power had been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians, with continuous efforts to stabilize the energy grid and reinstate heat and water supplies, especially in critical areas like Kyiv, Vinnytsia, and Lviv <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Additionally, in Kherson, almost the entire water supply has been reconnected, with around three-quarters of the boilers for heating operational again. Furthermore, to improve communication, two more Starlink Wi-Fi access points have been installed, aiding in the struggle to maintain basic services <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Despite restoration efforts, some neighborhoods, particularly along the Dnipro river, such as Hydropark, Antonivka, and Navtohavan, are still without heating or electricity due to the severity of ongoing shelling, which makes infrastructure repair nearly impossible <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Moreover, the city of Kherson has encountered frequent electricity disruptions, with 90% of properties reconnected, although areas like Antonivka are unable to have their power supply restored in the foreseeable future <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. To combat the contamination risks from disrupted water supplies, Kherson residents have been advised to boil water and continue precautionary measures even after repairs on the main water line have been completed <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. These restoration initiatives are critical as Ukraine continues to face a growing electricity deficit due to shelling, with state power utility Ukrenergo reporting nine missile and 12 UAV attacks on the power grid in the last three months, emphasizing the need for controlled consumption to avoid emergency outages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.
