# What are the potential risks and consequences if Belarus becomes more directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine, especially for regional stability and international relations?

## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Direct Belarusian military involvement in Ukraine could exacerbate regional instability, as it would strain Ukraine's defenses by forcing the allocation of forces to its northern border, potentially making other areas more vulnerable to Russian attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Additionally, such an involvement would likely poison relations among Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians for generations, undermining the rules-based international order and affecting security as far as the Middle East and Africa <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:summary>
The potential involvement of Belarusian troops in the Ukraine conflict could be deeply unpopular within Belarus and may not significantly impact the military balance due to their army's limited strength and experience, but it could force Ukraine to divert forces to its northern border, potentially leaving other areas more vulnerable to Russian assaults <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Such a move by Belarus might also further strain international relations, as it would signify support for the use of force as a foreign policy tool, which could undermine the rules-based international order and have implications for global security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The actions of Belarus, acting as a launchpad for the Russian invasion, have already damaged relations between Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, and further involvement could exacerbate these tensions and the long-term consequences for regional stability <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. The uncertainty surrounding the intentions of Belarus's leadership adds to the precariousness of the situation, with the potential to further destabilize an already tense security environment in Eastern Europe and beyond <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The potential for Belarusian troops to become directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine poses significant risks for regional stability and international relations. The involvement of Belarus could force Ukraine to commit more forces to its northern border, potentially leaving it more vulnerable to Russian assaults elsewhere. This could also send a negative message globally, undermining the notion that force is not a viable foreign policy tool and weakening the rules-based international order <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Belarusian involvement might also raise the stakes for neighboring countries, increasing the likelihood of a broader regional conflict that could destabilize areas such as the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and even regions as far as Central Asia and Africa <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>Moreover, direct Belarusian participation in the conflict could have long-lasting consequences on the relationships between Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Russians, poisoning ties for generations <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. It could also potentially open up opportunities for post-conflict reconstruction and alignment with Western institutions for countries like Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova, but this hinges on a Ukrainian victory and the end of aggressive actions by neighboring states. A more involved Belarus could also signal a shift towards a more assertive Russian stance in the region, increasing the risks of interdicting supply lines from NATO member countries and threatening the security of the entire region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Already, Western sanctions have made it hard for Belarus to ship potash fertilizers, its top export, via Baltic ports. Western military analysts say Lukashenkos small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere. The Pentagon said on Dec. 13 that it did not see "any type of impending cross-border activity by Belarus at this time."|

A Ukrainian victory would bring with it the prospect of a sustainable peace and the opportunity to build on the countrys vast potential. The consequences would also be felt far beyond Ukraines borders, with the security situation likely to improve dramatically in the Balkans, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and as far away as Central Asia and Africa. On a global scale, Ukraines success would reinvigorate the entire democratic world while demonstrating the renewed strength of the rules-based international order.|

Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for "all possible defence scenarios" against Moscow and its ally. "Protecting our border, both with Russia and Belarus, is our constant priority," Zelenskiy said on Sunday after a meeting with Ukraines top military command. "We are preparing for all possible defence scenarios."|

There is little public enthusiasm in Belarus for the invasion of Ukraine, leading to doubts over the reliability of the Belarusian army if Lukashenka does give the order to cross the Ukrainian border. However, the Belarus dictator is almost entirely dependent on Moscow for his political survival and risks becoming expendible if he refuses direct Russian demands to join the war. For the time being, Putin and Lukashenkas intentions remain shrouded in mystery.|

The fact that the aggressor invaded Ukraine from the territory of Belarus with the consent of the Belarusian authorities can neither be justified nor forgiven. Irreparable things have happened, and their long-term consequences on the lives of several generations will poison relations between Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. On behalf of the members of the independent trade unions of Belarus, the workers of our country, we bow to you, our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.|

Weeks later, whenPutin declared his "special military operation"on February 24, he sent missiles, paratroopers and a huge armored column of soldiers rolling south from Belarusian soil. Unraveling the role that Belarushas played in the Ukraine war has taken on new urgency since Lukashenko announced in October that Russian soldiers would deploy to the country to form a new, "regional grouping" and carry out new joint exercises with Belarusian troops, raising fears that he might draw the countrymore directly into the conflict. Putin has been laying the groundwork to transform Belarus into a vassal state for some time.|

A tall order considering Russia's capabilities and the basic geography of the region. Once again, the threat alone of such an operation, especially paired with a military buildup of significant scale, could keep Ukrainian forces tied down near the border and thus potentially making its front-line presence thinner. More specifically, the threat from Belarus could limit the number of troops Ukraine could mass for operations to break Russias new defensive lines holding the Donbas, southern Ukraine, and ultimately Crimea.|

It might open up new opportunities for Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova, and for the West to finish ordering Europe in its image. For Belarus, a path could emerge toward the end of dictatorship and toward free and fair elections. Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine could strive together for eventual integration into the European Union and possibly NATO, following the model of Central and Eastern European governments after the fall of the Soviet Union.|

Risks and uncertainties The chief risk associated with the EPC is that it becomes a talking shop with no tangible results. Secondly, the EPC may be seen in eastern Europe as a diversion from EU membership, not as a stepping stone.|

ISWs December 15 MDCOA warning forecast about a potential Russian offensive against northern Ukraine in winter 2023 remains a worst-case scenario within the forecast cone. ISW currently assesses the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine from Belarus as low, but possible, and the risk of Belarusian direct involvement as very low.
