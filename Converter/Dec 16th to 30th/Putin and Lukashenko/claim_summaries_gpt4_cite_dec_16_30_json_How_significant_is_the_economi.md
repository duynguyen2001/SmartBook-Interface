Both emphasized the challenges of Western economic sanctions pressure, underlining the need to support each other. Putin said he expected trade between the two countries to reach a record this year, at the equivalent of $40 billion. Lukashenko said that, despite "some rough edges," Belarus and Russia would find answers to all threats; and expressed the hope that the West will "listen to the voice of reason" so a dialogue on security could resume.|

On the economic front, since the February escalation, China and Russia have deepened ties. In the first nine months of 2022, China-Russia bilateral trade increased by 32 per cent to 136.09 billion US dollars. But some striking imbalances exist within this economic relationship: China is Russias largest trading partner, whereas Russia does not even rank amongst Chinas top ten.|

Putin said that Russia remains the largest investor in Belarus, to the tune of some $4 billion. For his part, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said that 2022 had been a record for Russian-Belarusian relations on all levels and claimed that "sanctions had a painful boomerang effect on their initiators." The European Union and the United States have imposed a range of sanctions on Belarus, principally against senior officials of Lukashenko's government as well as air travel and some exports.|

Russian companies and individuals were put on sanctions lists, various financial services for Russians were blocked, and even Russian oil and gas imports were curbed. Many multinationals pulled out of the Russian market and divested from its economy, while governments sought to minimise trade with Moscow. For years, Palestinians have dreamed of this type of action in defence of their rights.|

Under the Lee administration, Taipei doubled down on informal diplomatic efforts, including by opening representative offices in dozens of countries, following the model it used with the United States and Japan from the decade prior, and utilizing unofficial travel for reciprocal exchanges between government officials; this latter approach was spurred in part by Taiwans burgeoning transition to a full democracy and surging economic growth. Taiwan took advantage of its economic strength to help grow its international space. It fostered deeper trade and investment relationships with major economies around the world, which lessened its reliance on the PRC market.|

Back then, Mr. Putins instincts mostly proved right. The Ukrainian military withdrew swiftly from Crimea some soldiers and sailors switched sides to join Russia and the Wests limited sanctions scarcely affected Russias economy, sealing Mr. Putins confidence. "I took responsibility for everything," Mr. Putin said after taking Crimea, according to a confidant.|

"For 50 years, a market, mutual economic connections, were being built. Now they are destroyed for decades to come," Zadornov said.|

The summit was held against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has caused a crisis in both Russia's relations with the West and within the CIS itself. "We have to admit, unfortunately, that disagreements also arise between the member states of the Commonwealth," Putin said in a rare public acknowledgment of the simmering tensions within the group.|

They in turn devoted their answers to ever-closer economic, industrial and defense alignment between their two former Soviet states - already formally allied in a somewhat nebulous "Union" - and to the excitement of Sunday's World Cup soccer final in Qatar. Belarus' political opposition, largely driven into jail, exile or silence, fears a creeping Russian annexation or "absorption" of its much smaller Slavic neighbor which, like Russia, has been hurt by sweeping Western economic sanctions. Both Putin and Lukashenko dismissed the idea.|

Foreign diplomats say committing Belarusian troops would be deeply unpopular at home. Already, Western sanctions have made it hard for Belarus to ship potash fertilizers, its top export, via Baltic ports. Western military analysts say Lukashenkos small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere.|
