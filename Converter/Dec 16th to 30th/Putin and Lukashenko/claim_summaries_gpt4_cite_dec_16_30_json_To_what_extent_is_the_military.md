Despite the deepened military ties and Belarus' role in facilitating Russian military actions, President Lukashenko has maintained that Belarusian troops will not directly engage in the Ukraine war, reflecting domestic unpopularity for such involvement <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Additionally, the Kremlin is using this cooperation to project an image of a unified and competent military command structure, possibly to offset criticism from pro-war factions within Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

The recent military cooperation between Russia and Belarus, including joint military exercises and the establishment of a joint military unit, is a direct response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the perceived threats along the outer borders of their Union state. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have emphasized the protection of their countries' safety, with Putin visiting Minsk to discuss the continued collaboration in the military sphere, as well as the development and exchange of military equipment and weapons <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This cooperation is taking place amid heightened tensions, as Belarus has allowed Russian troops to use its territory for launching attacks, despite Lukashenko asserting that Belarusian troops will not enter the war <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The intensification of military activities and strategic discussions between the two leaders suggests a coordinated response to the conflict in Ukraine. While Lukashenko has maintained that Belarus will not join the war, his country's support in providing a launching pad for Russian troops has been crucial. The meeting between Putin and Lukashenko, along with the deployment of Russian warplanes to Belarus, signals a strengthening military alliance. Moreover, Belarus's reliance on Russian support following contested elections and the subsequent protests has contributed to the deepening of military ties between the two nations. Accordingly, the ongoing partnership serves as a means to counterbalance international isolation and criticism of the Russian MoD, and to project a unified front against perceived external pressures <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.

Three Russian warplanes and an airborne early warning and control aircraft were deployed to Belarus last week. But Lukashenko, a pariah in the West who relies heavily on Moscow for support, has repeatedly said Belarus will not enter the war in Ukraine. Foreign diplomats say committing Belarusian troops would be deeply unpopular at home.|

The Kremlin likely consciously publicized Gerasimovs, Shoigus, and Surovikins attendance at the meeting with Putin to present the Russian MoD as an organized, unified, and effective war-fighting institution and to shield the top commanders of the Russian Armed Forces from further criticism. The Russian MoD has taken great care in the past months to affirm Gerasimovs continued role as Chief of the General Staff for a similar reason- in the absence of tangible Russian victories against Ukraine, Russian military leadership seeks to present a picture of a functional and seamless chain of military command. [5] The Kremlin is likely attempting to rehabilitate the image of the Russian MoD to counterbalance the growing influence of pro-war ultra-nationalist figures, primarily that of Chechen Republic head Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner Group Financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, and their parallel military structures.|

Russia said it was ready to support Lukashenko's leadership should the protests get "out of control." Following months of increased joint military exercises and meetings, concerns have grown that Belarus could enter the Ukraine war to assist Russia (it has already allowed Moscow to launch attacks from its territory). On Monday, Lukashenko said nothing would be able to "break our relationship" with Russia but did not mention the possibility of Belarus assisting Russia in the war in Ukraine.|

Lukashenko, who held onto power following what is widely seen as a fraudulent election in 2020, is reliant on financial support from Putin. Belarus in return allowed Russian troops to use its land as a launch pad during its initial invasion of Ukraine in February, although the former Soviet state has not joined the conflict. Hours before Putin's visit to Minsk, the Interfax news agency reported that Russian troops will conduct military exercises in Belarus.|

However, others have suggested that the Minsk meeting may have been nothing more than an opportunity for both parties to demonstrate their loyalty to each other at a time when each ruler is confronted by deepening international isolation. If military matters were indeed discussed, this does not necessarily indicate plans for Belarus to directly participate in a new Kyiv offensive. Other options could include an expansion of the current Belarusian role as a base of operations for the Russian military or the provision of armor and ammunition from the Belarusian arsenal.|

It hasnt been our focus. Since September, certainly our focus has been on standing up for the fundamental freedoms of the Iranian people and countering Irans deepening military partnership with Russia and its support for Russia as Moscow wages its brutal invasion of Ukraine. Yes.|

Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said he believed Putin's meeting with his Belarusian counterpart would address "further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground." Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said repeatedly he has no intention of sending his country's troops into Ukraine, after providing Russian troops with a launching pad for the invasion in February. "Russia has no interest in absorbing anyone," Putin said during the news conference.|
