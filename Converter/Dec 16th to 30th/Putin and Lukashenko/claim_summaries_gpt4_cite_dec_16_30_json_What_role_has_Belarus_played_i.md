## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
Belarus has played a supportive role in the Ukraine conflict by allowing Russian troops to use its territory as a launch pad for the initial invasion in February, and by serving as a training base for mobilized Russian troops, despite its leader's denial of active participation and positioning as a potential mediator <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. While Belarusian troops have not directly engaged in combat, the ongoing military exercises with Russian forces in Belarusian territory indicate a potential evolution of its role in the conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Belarus has played a significant yet indirect role in the Ukraine conflict by allowing Russian troops to use its territory as a launch pad for the initial invasion in February 2021 <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Despite this involvement, Belarusian leader Lukashenko has sought to position Belarus as a potential mediator and has denied active participation in the conflict, while also acknowledging the need to support Russia <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. However, with continued military exercises between Russian and Belarusian troops within Belarusian borders <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font> and the strategic partnership with Russia, where Belarus relies on financial support from Putin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>, the potential for an evolving role in the conflict remains. Lukashenko's assurances that Belarusian troops have not been directly involved in the conflict suggest a cautious approach, but the country's actions, such as facilitating Russia's initial invasion and hosting military exercises, indicate a supportive stance towards Russia's actions in Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

Belarus has played a significant yet complex role in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, primarily by acting as a strategic support base for Russian military operations. Despite President Alexander Lukashenko's public denial of direct involvement and his attempts to position Belarus as a potential mediator in the conflict, the country has been instrumental in Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops used Belarusian territory as a springboard for attacking northern Ukraine and the capital city of Kyiv, while Belarus also provided medical assistance to injured Russian forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. Furthermore, Belarus has allowed Russian forces to conduct military exercises within its borders and has been a launchpad for missile strikes against Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The evolving role of Belarus in the conflict, however, remains uncertain. While Lukashenko has maintained that Belarusian troops will not join Russia's "special military operation," the presence of Russian troops and military exercises in Belarus keeps the prospect of greater involvement open. Ukrainian intelligence has also reported seeing Belarusian soldiers alongside Russian forces after the invasion began, indicating a level of cooperation beyond what the Belarusian leadership publicly acknowledges <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. Moreover, Russia's provision of S-400 air missile defense systems to Belarus and the two countries' discussions of strategic partnerships suggest a deepening military alliance that could influence Belarus's role in the protracted conflict <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.

Ever since the outbreak of hostilities, he has denied that Belarus is actively participating in the conflict and has instead sought to position himself as a potential mediator. At the same time, in an apparent nod to his Kremlin patrons, Lukashenka has made a number of public declarations acknowledging the need to support neighboring Russia.|

From the outset, the primary military goal was to remove a democratically elected government and replace it with one that would either be Russian or fiercely pro-Russian, and to destroy all vestiges of the current state of Ukraine. The initial attack came from the territory of Belarus and focused on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Russian optimism in military planning derived from the earlier conflict of 2014 when Russia easily annexed Crimea and imposed separatist regimes in the eastern Donbas.|
