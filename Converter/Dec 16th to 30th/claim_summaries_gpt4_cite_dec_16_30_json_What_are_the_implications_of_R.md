## Summary
<DetailSlider>
<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The deployment of Russian forces in Belarus and their use of Belarusian territory has escalated tensions by facilitating military operations against Ukraine, with the potential for Belarus to become more directly involved in the conflict, despite domestic and international concerns <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. This presence has also enabled Russia to use Belarus as a strategic launchpad for the invasion, contributing to the destabilization of the region and posing a continuous threat to Ukrainian security <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The presence of Russian forces in Belarus and the use of Belarusian territory as a launchpad for operations against Ukraine raises concerns over the potential for Belarus to become more directly involved in the conflict, which could escalate the war and possibly draw in additional countries <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite assertions by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of no intention to send Belarusian troops into Ukraine, his country has been instrumental in supporting Russian military efforts, including serving as a base for troops and a site for launching airstrikes against Ukrainian targets <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. Western military analysts believe that while the Belarusian army may not significantly alter the balance of power due to its small size and lack of combat experience, their engagement could nonetheless force Ukraine to divert forces to its northern border, potentially weakening its defense against Russian assaults in other areas <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. Furthermore, the Pentagon has noted no imminent cross-border activity by Belarus as of mid-December, suggesting a level of uncertainty or possible misinformation regarding Belarusian military intentions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The deployment of Russian troops in Belarus for joint military exercises and the establishment of a "regional grouping" have heightened concerns about Belarus's direct involvement in the conflict with Ukraine <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The presence of Russian forces in Belarus has been instrumental for launching operations against Ukraine, including the initial invasion in February 2022 from Belarusian territory, and the ongoing use of Belarus as a base for missile strikes and training of Russian troops <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. Belarus's participation in the conflict, whether by hosting Russian forces or potentially contributing its own troops, could force Ukraine to allocate resources to its northern border, thereby weakening its defenses against Russian assaults in other regions <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strategic use of Belarusian territory by Russian forces has implications beyond military maneuvers. It serves as a pressure point on Ukraine, creating a multi-front challenge that could limit Ukraine's ability to concentrate forces in key areas such as the Donbas, southern Ukraine, and Crimea <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, Belarus's involvement has broader geopolitical repercussions, potentially signaling Russia's intent to assert greater control over Belarus, transforming it into a vassal state <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. This could destabilize the region further and possibly escalate the war, drawing in other countries and exacerbating the already severe humanitarian and economic impacts of the conflict, such as increased fuel prices and the threat of food shortages <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

## Claims

|<font id="1" color=#FF3399>[1]</font> Western military analysts say Lukashenkos small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Lean Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-heads-belarus-russian-drones-target-ukrainian-capital-rcna62334" target="_blank">NBC News (Online)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div></div></div>| Foreign diplomats say committing Belarusian troops would be deeply unpopular at home. Already, Western sanctions have made it hard for Belarus to ship potash fertilizers, its top export, via Baltic ports. Western military analysts say Lukashenkos small army lacks the strength and combat experience to make a big difference but that by forcing Ukraine to commit forces to its north it could leave it more exposed to Russian assaults elsewhere. The Pentagon said on Dec. 13 that it did not see "any type of impending cross-border activity by Belarus at this time."|
|<font id="2" color=#FF3399>[2]</font> And what would the implications be of any kind of new offensive that brings in outside countries?|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2022/sgsm21640.doc.htm" target="_blank">press.un.org</a></div><div></div><div></div></div>| Are you concerned about a new serious escalation of the war that possibly could bring in other countries? Because all of the political pundits are saying that Putin is going to ask for Belarus' help in launching a new offensive against Kyiv. And what would the implications be of any kind of new offensive that brings in outside countries? Secretary-General: Well, first of all, we have seen a massive escalation already with the heavy bombardment of electrical infrastructure, which, of course, is having a dramatic impact in the living conditions of the Ukrainians at the present moment, and we'll have terrible consequences for the future.|
|<font id="3" color=#FF3399>[3]</font> Unraveling the role that Belarushas played in the Ukraine war has taken on new urgency since Lukashenko announced in October that Russian soldiers would deploy to the country to form a new, "regional grouping" and carry out new joint exercises with Belarusian troops, raising fears that he might draw the countrymore directly into the conflict.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/facts-first-cnn-media-bias" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Left" /></a><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-12-20-22/h_495871910650c8a45c8cd76af31435b0" target="_blank">CNN Fact Check</a></div><div>*(Fact Check)*</div><div>Dec 20th, 2022</div></div>| In early February, Russia sent some 30,000 troops ostensibly forjoint military exerciseswith Belarus the biggest deployment to the former Soviet state since the end of the Cold War. Weeks later, whenPutin declared his "special military operation"on February 24, he sent missiles, paratroopers and a huge armored column of soldiers rolling south from Belarusian soil. Unraveling the role that Belarushas played in the Ukraine war has taken on new urgency since Lukashenko announced in October that Russian soldiers would deploy to the country to form a new, "regional grouping" and carry out new joint exercises with Belarusian troops, raising fears that he might draw the countrymore directly into the conflict. Putin has been laying the groundwork to transform Belarus into a vassal state for some time.|
|<font id="4" color=#FF3399>[4]</font> Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said he believed Putin's meeting with his Belarusian counterpart would address "further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground."|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/voice-america" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="Center" /></a><div><a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-situation-extremely-difficult-in-areas-russia-claimed-to-annex-from-ukraine/6883787.html" target="_blank">Voice of America (VOA)</a></div><div>*(News Media)*</div><div>Dec 20th, 2022</div></div>| Putin called Tuesday for Russia's top security agency, the FSB, to boost surveillance at the countrys borders and within the country in order to combat new threats from abroad and traitors at home. His comments came a day after he made a rare visit to Minsk, extolling the benefits of cooperation with neighboring ally Belarus, stoking fears in Kyiv that plans for a joint ground offensive are in the works. Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said he believed Putin's meeting with his Belarusian counterpart would address "further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground." Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said repeatedly he has no intention of sending his country's troops into Ukraine, after providing Russian troops with a launching pad for the invasion in February.|
|<font id="5" color=#FF3399>[5]</font> For the past ten months, he has permitted Russia to base troops in Belarus and launch airstrikes from the country against Ukrainian targets.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/will-putin-force-belarus-to-join-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 22nd, 2022</div></div>| Alternatively, the entire episode may be part of an elaborate ruse to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent their redeployment to current invasion hot spots in southern and eastern Ukraine. Lukashenka is already widely seen as a party to the conflict after allowing Putin to use Belarus as a gateway for the initial invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For the past ten months, he has permitted Russia to base troops in Belarus and launch airstrikes from the country against Ukrainian targets. Following the announcement in September of Russias first mobilization since World War II, Belarus also began to serve as a training base for mobilized troops.|
|<font id="6" color=#FF3399>[6]</font> The initial attack came from the territory of Belarus and focused on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.e-ir.info/2022/12/22/opinion-the-rationale-of-russias-special-military-operation-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">e-ir.info</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 22nd, 2022</div></div>| One can dismiss the various statements of Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov and others early in 2022 that the goal was to de-Nazify and de-militarize Ukraine or that the war was a response to the expansion of NATO, particularly in the period 19992004, when its members could be found on the old Soviet western border as well as the inclusion of former Soviet republics Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. From the outset, the primary military goal was to remove a democratically elected government and replace it with one that would either be Russian or fiercely pro-Russian, and to destroy all vestiges of the current state of Ukraine. The initial attack came from the territory of Belarus and focused on capturing the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Russian optimism in military planning derived from the earlier conflict of 2014 when Russia easily annexed Crimea and imposed separatist regimes in the eastern Donbas.|
|<font id="7" color=#FF3399>[7]</font> Once again, the threat alone of such an operation, especially paired with a military buildup of significant scale, could keep Ukrainian forces tied down near the border and thus potentially making its front-line presence thinner.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/ukraine-situation-report-assessing-the-possibility-of-a-new-russian-offensive-on-kyiv" target="_blank">thedrive.com</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 17th, 2022</div></div>| Any real operation there with actual aims beyond that would be focused on trying to interdict the supply lines that run from NATO member countries into Ukraine. A tall order considering Russia's capabilities and the basic geography of the region. Once again, the threat alone of such an operation, especially paired with a military buildup of significant scale, could keep Ukrainian forces tied down near the border and thus potentially making its front-line presence thinner. More specifically, the threat from Belarus could limit the number of troops Ukraine could mass for operations to break Russias new defensive lines holding the Donbas, southern Ukraine, and ultimately Crimea.|
|<font id="8" color=#FF3399>[8]</font> The illegal invasion raised fuel prices.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/features/50-fintech-experts-share-industry-predictions-for-2023/" target="_blank">verdict.co.uk</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 20th, 2022</div></div>| When the US central bank hinted at the beginning of the year that it would start to raise interest rates and indicated a dialling back of its aggressive bond-buying programme, it flagged to the market that it was expecting a downturn. Russias invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the situation. The illegal invasion raised fuel prices. It also threatened to cause a worldwide food shortage and spill over into other nations either via fighting on the ground or on the internet saying nothing about the risk of human suffering and deaths.|
|<font id="9" color=#FF3399>[9]</font> After the withdrawal of Russian troops from northern Ukraine and the territories around Kyiv, Belarusian authorities have provided their territory to Russia to launch missile strikes against Ukraine and for the training of Russian troops.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-vladimir-putin-bolsters-belarus-alexander-lukashenko-kyiv-eyes-assault-from-the-north/" target="_blank">politico.eu</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 19th, 2022</div></div>| Russia also supplied S-400 air missile defense systems to Belarus, Lukashenko added. In the opening weeks of Russias full-scale invasion, Minsk allowed Russian forces to use its territory as a springboard for an attack on northern Ukraine and Kyiv, as well as providing medical assistance to injured Russian forces. After the withdrawal of Russian troops from northern Ukraine and the territories around Kyiv, Belarusian authorities have provided their territory to Russia to launch missile strikes against Ukraine and for the training of Russian troops. During the press conference, Putin and Lukashenko did not comment on Moscows almost 10-month war on Ukraine and the possible involvement of Minsk in Russias ground operation after a series of setbacks for Russian troops.|
|<font id="10" color=#FF3399>[10]</font> If Russia is decisively defeated in Ukraine, the path will be open to a safer and more prosperous planet.|<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column;"><a href="" target="_blank"><BiasChart bias="N/A" /></a><div><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russias-defeat-is-the-top-global-priority-for-2023/" target="_blank">atlanticcouncil.org</a></div><div></div><div>Dec 22nd, 2022</div></div>| The world enters 2023 at a crossroads. Russia seeks to dismantle the progress of recent decades and drag us all back to an era of imperial aggression, but the Kremlin must first overcome Ukrainian resistance. If Russia is decisively defeated in Ukraine, the path will be open to a safer and more prosperous planet. Securing this defeat must be the international communitys top priority in 2023.|
