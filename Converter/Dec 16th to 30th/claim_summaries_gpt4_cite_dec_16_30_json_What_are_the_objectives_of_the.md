<template v-slot:less-detailed>
The Russian military's persistent shelling of the Kherson region aims to target civilian infrastructure, including heating systems and water supply, inflicting damage and hardship on the population amid the harsh winter <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. This tactic follows a broader strategy of undermining Ukrainian morale and capabilities by destroying the country's energy infrastructure and causing widespread disruptions to civilian life, as the military fails to achieve significant advances on the battlefield <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

The Russian military's persistent shelling of the Kherson region appears to be multifaceted, with objectives including targeting civilians and infrastructure, such as heating systems and water supply, to exacerbate the hardships of winter and displace the population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</font>. After withdrawing from Kherson city, the attacks serve both to terrorize the liberated population and to undermine any sense of security or normalcy they might have regained <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>. The strategy also seems to be a response to Russia's inability to generate significant military gains or to counter Ukraine's successful counterattacks, by shifting focus to long-range missile and drone attacks to cripple civilian life and infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</font>. The relentless shelling and destruction of infrastructure, such as power and heating services, is believed to be part of a wider tactic to punish civilians and create a humanitarian crisis during the harsh winter months <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>.

<template v-slot:more-detailed>
The Russian military's persistent shelling of the Kherson region appears to be part of a strategy to instill fear and disrupt daily life following the withdrawal of their forces from the city. The bombardment has been targeting civilian infrastructure, including heating systems, water supplies, and residential areas, causing casualties among the local population <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The relentless shelling has intensified since the region's recapture by Ukrainian forces in November, with local officials reporting dozens of attacks daily, resulting in deaths, injuries, and significant damage to the city and its surroundings <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#6">6</a>]</font>. The attacks have not only inflicted physical harm but have also forced civilians to flee, further destabilizing the recently liberated region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The strategic objectives behind these attacks seem to be multifaceted. On the one hand, they serve to maintain pressure on Ukrainian forces and the civilian population, effectively punishing the region for being reclaimed by Ukraine and also attempting to weaken Ukrainian morale <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>]</font>. On the other hand, the shelling and targeting of infrastructure seem to be part of a broader Russian tactic to create difficult living conditions for civilians during the winter months by disrupting essential services such as electricity and heating, thereby compounding the humanitarian crisis in the region <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>]</font>. Additionally, the shelling may be intended to prevent Ukrainian forces from consolidating their control over the region and to keep them on the defensive, as well as possibly setting traps for Ukrainian forces on the east bank of the Dnipro River <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>, <a href="#10">10</a>]</font>.

Russian forces "shelled the territory of Kherson region 69 times" on Sunday, said Yaroslav Yanushevych, head of Kherson region military administration, adding that the attacks killed at least three people, injured six, struck a hotel and apartment buildings, and also damaged infrastructure in the region that was recaptured in November. Heating systems and water supply impacted: Halyna Luhova, head of Kherson city military administration, gave the following updates: In one district, the heating system needed water from the Dnipro river, but collecting it "is impossible due to sniper fire and shelling from mortars, artillery and Grad multiple-launch rocket systems," she said, recommending that people from such districts leave the city.|

Unable to properly target the Ukrainian military or defeat it on the battlefield, the inferior Russian military instead does what it can do best: target often defenseless civilians and civilian infrastructure.|

Saturday marks 10 months since the start of the Russian invasion. Ukraine has faced a blistering onslaught of Russian artillery fire, missiles, shelling and drone attacks since early October, much of it targeting the energy infrastructure in a bid to cut electricity and heating services as the freezing winter advances. The shelling has been especially intense in Kherson since Russian forces withdrew and Ukraine's army reclaimed the city in November.|

Russian forces abandoned Kherson city last month in one of Ukraine's most significant gains of the war. Kherson region, located at the mouth of the mighty Dnipro River and serving as gateway to Russian-annexed Crimea, is strategically important. The joy of Kherson residents over the city's liberation has quickly given way to fear amid relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnipro, and many have since fled.|

Just weeks earlier, he had hosted a lavish annexation ceremony in the Kremlin and proclaimed that Kherson had joined Russia "forever." Unable to make progress on the battlefield, Putin changed tack in October and ordered the methodical destruction of Ukraines civilian infrastructure. Waves of airstrikes featuring missiles and kamikaze drones have since plunged Ukraine into darkness while depriving millions of Ukrainians of heating, water, and electricity.|

Moscow-allied officials in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, meanwhile, said they have come under some of the heaviest shelling in years from Ukrainian forces, leaving one person dead. Despite Russias retreat from the southern port city in November, Kherson remains within reach of Moscows weaponry and under constant threat.

As fighting near the key Ukrainian city of Kreminna in the eastern Luhansk region continues, Russian civilians who had come to the city have stopped their work and left, according to the head of Luhansk's military administration. If the Ukrainian military is able to dislodge the Russians from Kreminna, the Ukrainian military could then proceed in two directions, the official said.
