<template v-slot:summary>
The use of Grad multiple-launch rocket systems by Russian forces in Kherson city's residential area was part of their offensive operations, targeting high-value assets to weaken Ukrainian defenses <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#2">2</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. These attacks resulted in significant civilian casualties, with at least 10 people killed and 55 injured <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. The strategic objective behind these strikes is likely to create chaos, disrupt Ukrainian military coordination, and maintain pressure on multiple fronts <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#3">3</a>]</font>. Despite causing destruction and casualties, these actions also serve to divert Ukrainian forces and resources, as part of broader Russian information operations designed to spread Kyiv's defenses thin <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</font>.

Russian forces have escalated their attacks on the recently liberated city of Kherson, utilizing Grad multiple-launch rocket systems to target civilian areas, causing significant casualties and damage to infrastructure <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>. The use of these rocket systems is part of a broader strategy to exert constant pressure on front lines in eastern regions of Ukraine and to terrorize the civilian population of Kherson, as acknowledged by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who condemned the attacks as acts of "terror" and characterized them as "killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure" <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. The bombardments have led to substantial disruptions in basic services, such as heating and water supply, with local officials urging residents in affected districts to leave the city to avoid sniper fire and shelling <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.<br/><br/>The military objectives behind these attacks appear to be twofold: to maintain a state of instability and fear within the city, and to weaken the resolve of both the civilian population and Ukrainian defense forces <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]</font>. By targeting Kherson's city center and other recently liberated settlements with frequent shelling, Russian forces aim to challenge Ukrainian control of the area and possibly to prepare for further offensive operations. These bombardments also serve as a deterrent, hindering the ability of Ukraine to consolidate its gains and rebuild critical infrastructure in the region, as well as forcing Ukraine to divert resources to defend against these persistent attacks <font color=#FF3399>[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#9">9</a>]</font>.
